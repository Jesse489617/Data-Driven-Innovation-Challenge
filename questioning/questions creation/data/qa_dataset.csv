Who was the second jinchriki of the Nine-Tails?,Kushina Uzumaki,Background,"Naruto, newborn with his mother Kushina. Naruto was born on the night of October 10th toMinato Namikaze andKushina Uzumaki. He was named afterNaruto Musasabi, the protagonist ofJiraiya'sfirst book, which made theSanninhis godfather.[14]TheThird Hokagemade special arrangements for Minato to preserve Kushina's seal containing the Nine-Tails while she gave birth to Naruto in a remote location, assisted by midwives andAnbu. A masked man,Tobi, tracked down their location, however, killed the midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to quickly rescue him andteleporthim to asafe house. Minato and Kushina protect Naruto from the Nine-Tails. With Minato gone, Tobi captured Kushina andreleasedthe Nine-Tails from her, using it todevastate Konoha.[15]Minato saved Kushina and left Naruto in her care before he went to protect the village,[16]eventually defeating Tobi andfreeingthe Nine-Tails from Tobi's control. Returning to Naruto and Kushina's location, Minato realised the only way to stop the Nine-Tails was to seal it within Naruto, believing that his son would someday need the fox's power to defeat Tobi when he returned.[17]Since the Nine-Tails'chakrawas too immense to be sealed into an infant, Minatosacrificed his soulto split the fox's chakra in half, sealing theYinhalf within himself and theYanghalfwithinNaruto. After telling Naruto how much they loved him, Minato and Kushina succumbed to their wounds from protecting their son from the Nine-Tails and passed away. Orphaned, and not having anyone else to provide for him, Naruto received monthly income from the village in order to afford daily necessities. Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies.[18]Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the Third Hokage forbade anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as their parents did.[19]However, Naruto's peers emulated their parents' hatred of him, despite not knowing why. This social isolation caused Naruto to crave acknowledgement, which he would gain by pulling pranks. Naruto meets Hinata. On the day of her enrolment in theNinja Academy[20]- Naruto first metHinata Hyūga, who was being picked on by three bullies. Despite not knowing her, Naruto immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious, and the bullies damaged his red scarf. When Naruto awoke, Hinata thanked him for helping her and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. He was unaware that the girl's growing affection for him began at that moment.[21] Naruto and Sasuke in the Academy. In the Academy, Naruto became a student ofIruka Umino, who acted as a surrogate older brother to keep him in line and help him work harder. Naruto also met his classmateSasuke Uchihaand tried to befriend him, since Sasuke was alone as well. Jealous of Sasuke's skills and popularity, however,[22]he developed a one-sided rivalry in his pursuit to prove himself just as good as, if not better than, Sasuke, wishing that someday, Sasuke would accept him as an equal.[23]Naruto also grew close with the owner ofRamen Ichiraku,Teuchiand his daughterAyame, being welcomed as their favourite customer."
What is the name of Naruto's favourite food?,ramen,Personality,"Naruto's ninja registration photo. Naruto is noted as boisterous, exuberant, and unorthodox, quite similar toHashirama Senju.[24]He inherited his mother's verbal tic, as he ends his sentences with ""Dattebayo!"" when emotional. Though he responds best to competition and is not afraid to ask for assistance, Naruto is relatively naïve and slow to understand principles or situations. He often requires an oversimplified analogy in order to grasp explanations[25]and can even prove forgetful.[26]Naruto is aware of his faults and admits he acts strong to mask his embarrassment and frustration about them.[27][28]Despite his naivety, Naruto can be quite observant, picking up on things others miss and retaining information casually gathered through conversation.[29] Growing up as an orphan who suffered years of hatred and social isolation has influenced Naruto's character in a number of ways: he is heedless to formality and social standings, addressingcertainpeoplewith nicknames instead ofhonourifics, although by the time of his adulthood, Naruto has slightly outgrown this trait.[30][31]He has picky eating habits of ramen, his favourite food; he has a perverted side that manifests as attempts to peep into women's baths, although these moments are rare.[32]Despite his quirks and the criticism he recieves for them , Naruto is said to have a personality that draws people to him,[33]inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that could change a person's world view and thus builtmeaningful relationshipsthat he lacked in early life; theSage of Six Pathsbelieves Naruto's kindness is a special gift that allows him to saveKuramafrom its hatred.[34]Naruto deeply cherishes these bonds and will go to great lengths to protect them, best seen with Sasuke after his defection from Konoha. Another of Naruto's prominent traits is his desire for acknowledgement; his pranks around the village were for people to notice him, even if it meant by scolding him. Therefore, he dreamed of one day becoming Konoha's Hokage, the epitome of acknowledgement and respect from everyone in the village.[35]Knowing his dream is a long, arduous and seemingly impossible path, Naruto developed his ownnindōof never going back on his word. This life-long philosophy serves as the cornerstone of Naruto's great self-confidence; he believes he can accomplish any goal with enough hard work and perseverance, no matter what. This trait guides him in many aspects of life, such as his promise to bring Sasuke back to Konoha. Over time, his goal to be Hokage grew from a desire for the acknowledgement of others to a desire to help and protect the people close to him, whichTobiattributed to theWill of Fire.[36]His nindō has since been reinforced by his understanding that shinobi were meant to endure through hardships.[37]His belief in hard work and perseverance made him detest shortcuts to achieving, as he disqualified his son from theChūnin Examsfor using the bannedKote, and expressed disgust atMomoshikiandKinshiki Ōtsutsukifor their reliance on harvesting fromChakra Fruitsto lazily gain power.[38] After the death of his masterJiraiya, talking to his fatherMinatoand listening toNagato's tragic story, Naruto grew to understand the destructive cycle of hatred and he vowed to break it in order to bring true peace to the world.[39]To that end, his participation in theFourth Shinobi World Waris not only to protect his friends but also to bear and erase the world's hatred all by himself. After encountering areincarnatedItachi Uchiha, however, Naruto realises that he cannot handle everything alone and that he must allow his friends to support and fight alongside him. As he does so in war's climax, his fighting spirit inspires theAllied Shinobi Forcesto join him and keep fighting to end the war as well, ultimately becoming an example for many people to admire, follow, and believe in.[40][41] Naruto becomes shy around Hinata. Naruto first metHinata Hyūgawhen they were children, where his open kindness and courageous spirit earned him her admiration, which grew into love. On his part, Naruto remained mostly oblivious to Hinata's feelings for him and even considered her ""weird"" because of her shyness around him and his socially ostracised childhood. However, that change during the Chūnin Exams in Part I when they began to interact more and support each other, causing Naruto to like her as a friend.[42]In Part II, as Hinata becomes willing to risk her life to protect Naruto, he, in turn, sees her as an actively strong person despite his speechlessness at her love confession. Naruto grew to love Hinata subconsciously. Still, he was unaware of it because he kept ""fighting"" for Sakura, which was just another way for him to compete with Sasuke. DuringThe Last: Naruto the Movie, Naruto finally recognises the love that Hinata has always had for him, causing him to become more bashful and protective of her, just as she was for him. Realising that she alone has ever had faith in him and that she has always been there for him, he reciprocates her feelings and desires to be with her for the rest of his life. This new-found desire made him willing to make healthier lifestyle choices such as eating vegetables and reeling in his impulsiveness, something others have had little success with doing. As an adult, Naruto becomes wiser and more mature, though he retains some of his negligence for honourifics.[43]Although he finally achieves his dream of becoming Hokage, its many tasks would often overwhelm Naruto to the point of him being unable to spend time with his family. He admits that part of this stems was from not having grown up with a father himself, making him unsure of how to interact appropriately with his children.[44]Naruto also tends to be more responsible in his duties as Hokage than as a father. Nevertheless, Naruto profoundly loves his family, as he creates shadow clones to tend to them while he's busy, protects them in times of danger, spends time with them when he can, and expresses pride in his children's successes.[38]He adopts Hiruzen's philosophy that everyone in the village is his family, believing that genuine relationships are made up of love rather than blood relations.[45]His refusal to give his son any special treatment due to their blood-relationships, along with the insistence that the boy professionally addresses him as ""Seventh"" or ""Hokage"" while in the office, is a testament of Naruto's lack of bias and prejudice.[38]Likewise, even in the face of people close to him committing horrible deeds, Naruto remains loyal to them, pushing aside his grief enough to see the nature of what they did.[46]However, after facingMomoshiki Ōtsutsukiand realising how his overly-committed nature serving the entire village was significantly affecting his own family's happiness, Naruto came to accept that he needed to give them more attention. As such, by allowing more help from others, Naruto was able to enjoy more time with his family, restoring the same healthy relationship he had with them before he became Hokage."
Where does Naruto discover the Falls of Truth?,Island Turtle,Dark naruto,"""Dark Naruto"" reveals himself in the waterfall. Although he struggled to overcome the hatred of people and the shinobi world, seeking to achieve the peace that his master Jiraiya dreamed of so much, Naruto was also not free from his own hatred. When Naruto understands that it is necessary to definitively master the power of the Nine-Tails, he goes to theIsland Turtleand discovers theFalls of Truthas part of the process. There, Naruto encounters his darker half:Dark Naruto.[47]This was the personification of all of Naruto's negative feelings, such as the grudge he secretly still held against the villagers of Konoha who had always rejected him since childhood. Dark Naruto was the Nine-Tails' favourite aspect of Naruto, claiming him to be the ""real"" Naruto. No matter how much he resisted, the Nine-Tails would tap into the hatred that existed hidden in the depths of his heart.[48]Naruto's conclusion to dealing with his inner hatred was not to ignore him, but rather accept his existence, understanding that this same grudge was what made him get to where he was and value his entire journey up until that moment.[49]This whole process served as basis for Naruto to shape who he truly wanted to be from then on."
How many times did Naruto fail to graduate from the Academy?,three,Abilities,"Naruto's combined senjutsu and tailed beast influence over his trademark techniques. Originally, Naruto was a rather inept ninja, failing to graduate from theAcademythree times. Through sheer determination and training however, his skills rapidly improved to defeat stronggeninlikeNeji Hyūga,Gaara, andKabuto Yakushi, earning acknowledgement from all theSanninfor his potential.[56]Under various tutelage, Naruto was able todefeatvarious membersofAkatsuki, ultimately earning praise from Konohagakure as a Hokage-material hero.[57]Naruto's personally defeated various reincarnatedKage[58]andjinchūrikiduring the Fourth Shinobi World War,[59]with many believing he was the central key to winning the battle.[60][61][62]By adulthood, his prowess made him the Seventh Hokage, regarded as the strongest shinobi in history[63]and having command of overwhelmingjutsu.[64]With the combined might ofSasuke Uchiha, noted as his only rival in power,[38]they are said to be able to destroy the world.[65]Together, they overpowered anempowered-Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, and pushedJigen's body to its limit. Overall, he could compete against if not defeat world-threatening opponents, such asObito Uchiha,Madara Uchiha,Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, andToneri Ōtsutsuki, as well as fighting at hisabsolute peakmanaged to overwhelmIsshiki Ōtsutsuki."
How many times did Naruto share Kurama's chakra through physical contact?,four times,Chakra and physical prowess,"Naruto sharing Kurama's chakra through physical contact. Due to being madeKurama’sjinchūrikiat birth, Naruto has remarkably largechakrareserves, as a result of Kurama’s immense chakranaturallymixingwith Naruto's chakra over time.[66][67]Even as a child, his reserves had at least four times the amount of a seasonedJōninlikeKakashi Hatake,[68]and described byKarinas ""bright and warm"".[69]His initial poor chakra control was offset by his sheer reserves,[70]which were large enough to endure three and a half days of constant battle against several powerful opponents. Only by the end of his battle against Sasuke did he show exhaustion, and even then could still fight to a standstill and eventual victory.[71]Naruto's control improved greatly over time; able totransfer his chakrato others,[72]and perform one-handed hand seals.[73]Being an Uzumaki, Naruto's powerful life-force grants him an extreme longevity, healing power, stamina, and vitality;[74]this allowed him to survive the extraction of a tailed beast, though he required aid fromSakura Harunoto stay alive.[75]Naruto also learned how to countergenjutsufromJiraiya, but his ability to do so is limited.[76]In adulthood, Naruto's chakra is powerful enough to intimidate Kawaki into submission[77]and destroy high-level barriers simply by releasing a burst of it.[78]He could repelShikamaru Nara'sShadow Imitation Technique, a feat that no one else could do.[65]His chakra, when he combined it with hisson'sVanishing Rasengan, turned it into a giganticUltra-Big Ball Rasenganable to kill theempoweredMomoshiki Ōtsutsukiwho tried to use acopyof the technique to defeat his.[79]His chakra reserves were also so vast that he was able to overloadDelta'sAbsorbing Eyewith acontinuousRasengan-assault and still primed to defeat her.[80] Naruto attacking Gaara with his Naruto Uzumaki Two Thousand Combo. While naturally a short-range fighter, Naruto originally was inept attaijutsu, requiring unpredictable attacks to surprise combat experts likeKiba Inuzukaand Neji Hyūga.[81][82]He often utilised shadow clones in large if not massive numbers to simply overwhelm his foes.[83]Although these tactics resumed later, Naruto becomes much more adept at taijutsu due to Jiraiya's training.[84]AfterFukasaku's tutelage, he could fend off a pair of expert kenjutsu users.[85][86][87]Two years after the war, Naruto's taijutsu prowess could best dozens of opponents without shadow clones or enhancements.[21]As Hokage, his taijutsu could pressure Momoshiki after he had absorbedKinshiki Ōtsutsuki.[79]Naruto could even hold off Delta despite herextreme body modifications, ultimately controlling the pace of the battle to tire her out and gradually overwhelm her[88]to win despite being in the defensive.[80]His speed had also increased to the point where he could effortlessly catch up withKawakiafter he tried to escape from Naruto.[77]Likewise, in the anime, he is proven very resilient, able to take a point-blank blast from Kawaki's modifications unfazed.[89] Naruto's prototype Absorbing Hand. After losing his right arm during his final battle with Sasuke,Tsunadecultured an artificial prosthesis for him using the cells ofHashirama Senju. In addition to retaining the same mobility and dexterity as his original arm, it is likewise able to channel and manipulate chakra just as effectively. As his body and the prosthesis arms are only connected through his chakra itself he can easily remove and replace them.[90]After Momoshiki's defeat, Naruto took inspiration from hischakra absorption techniqueand hadKatasuke Tōnoand theScientific Ninja Weapons Teammodifiy the arm further with mechanical features. With it, Naruto is able toneutralise and even absorbenemy techniques, though they have yet to replicate Momoshiki's ability to discharge them as a counterattack.[90]"
What is the name of Naruto's version 1 form?,Baryon Mode,Jinchūriki transformations,"Main articles:Jinchūriki Forms,Nine-Tails Chakra ModeandBaryon Mode Naruto's Version 1 form. Originally as thejinchūrikiofKurama's Yang half, Naruto had access to massive reserves of exceptionally powerful chakra, which was at least a hundredfold greater than Kakashi's.[68]These chakra levels were increased even further when the Yin half of Kurama was reunited with the Yang half inside of Naruto. Due to his Uzumaki blood and being Kurama's jinchūriki for essentially his entire life, Naruto's chakra had become naturally compatible with the fox's,[91]allowing him to perform several chakra-taxing techniques unhindered. Originally, he could only access Kurama's chakra in times of great anger. It enhanced Naruto's abilities, but the fox's negative influence made Naruto more aggressive. While essentially remaining himself when accessing aVersion 1state, manifesting four tails would triggerVersion 2state, which made him lose control and would gradually turn into even moreferalforms, requiring outside assistance to suppress Kurama's power and regain control, prompting him to avoid relying on the fox's power whenever possible. By the end of the Fourth Great Shinobi War, he could access his Version 1 form without any loss in his mentality.[92] Naruto transforming from his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode into his Kurama Mode. Realising he could not avoid using Kurama's power, Naruto sought to control it with help fromKiller B, a jinchūriki who had fully mastered the power ofGyūki. Upon succeeding and taking most of Kurama's chakra, Naruto attained theNine-Tails Chakra Mode, which greatly increased his physical parameters. Naruto can also detectnegative emotionsin this mode, and useTailed Beast Chakra Armsfrom any part of his body as he pleases, as well as formTailed Beast Ballsfrom them. As he didn't have Kurama's cooperation, Naruto needed to exercise extreme caution while using the form, as the chakra exchange could cost him his life. Eventually, when Kurama acknowledged Naruto's life-long strength of character and Naruto learned the fox's true name, their new-found friendship granted Naruto access to itsfull power, which further increased his physical parameters and with no drawbacks. This also increased his resilience to such degrees to the point where he could survive theTen-Tails'Tenpenchiiand endure Toneri'sGolden Wheel Reincarnation Explosion— which was able to cut theMoonin half — with no visible signs of damage. This cooperation of Kurama also provides Naruto with an immediate resistance fromgenjutsu. Two years later, he couldstoreKurama's chakra within his arm to deliver powerful punches capable of creating massive craters on the Moon and depower Toneri from hisTenseigan Chakra Modeto his normal state, as well as block the latter's Golden Wheel Reincarnation Explosion. Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode. Failing to transform into a replica of Kurama at first, Naruto instead achieved aTailed Beast Modein the unique form of a life-sized transparent avatar of chakra. In it, he could createTailed Beast Ballsand revitalise the life-forces of any he touches physically or with the avatar,[93][94]heal nearly any wounds,[38]or grant them temporarily chakra-cloaks.[95]After he became the jinchūriki of Kurama's complete self, Naruto is able to manifest the demon fox outside himself for a period akin to summoning, allowing both to fight as separate entities. During the endgame of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto received chakra from the other tailed beasts,[96]which greatly increased his chakra reserves even further and allowed him to access their unique abilities himself, such asShukaku'ssandmanipulation,Saiken'ssoap bubble ninjutsuand ability to emitcorrosive liquids,Chōmei'sscale powder, orGyūki'sink creation, and infuse them into his owntechniques. With the infusion of all nine of the tailed beasts' respective chakra inside of him, Naruto has become a medium to connect all the tailed beasts to communicate with each other[97]and made him a human pillar for thepower of the Ten-Tails.[98] Naruto's Baryon Mode. In the most dire of situations, Naruto is able to access a deep level of Kurama's power,Baryon Mode. In this state, his facial features become even more akin to Kurama with nine blazing chakra tails which he can use in a similar manner to Tailed Beast Chakra Arms to catch and bind opponents or objects anddeflect attacks. He also displayed the ability to use these chakra tails to form a protective shield around something or someone.[99]In a process similar tonuclear fusion, Naruto's andKurama's chakra are consumed as raw materials to produce a new type of energy. When in use, it dramatically boosts Naruto's reflexes, raw might, and chakra to such extreme levels, able to surpass Isshiki's capabilities. Because all chakra is connected, the same power that is produced from bits of their lives also work to reduce the lifespan of opponents on contact. Due to its extreme energy consumption, Naruto must remain focused and not waste energy on extraneous thoughts and actions, to maximise the amount of time he can maintain Baryon Mode.[100]The drawback of this form is the high chance of death for Kurama from the extreme strain of this form. Upon Kurama's death from this form, while Naruto was spared the same fate, he lost access to all of Kurama's chakra and abilities.[101]"
"What was the only technique that Naruto could perform successfully, which had no practical use other than to shock people?",Sexy Technique,Ninjutsu,"Naruto using the Summoning Technique. In the Academy, theSexy Techniquewas the only technique that Naruto could perform successfully, which had no practical use other than to shock people. Later, he learned more advanced and useful ninjutsu fromJiraiya. This includedsummoningtoadsfrom Mount Myōboku to assist him, and use them tocrushenemies from above. He became skilled inshurikenjutsu, able to throw weapons quickly and with precision.[102]Naruto's repertoire expanded tofūinjutsu, where he couldstorehis weapons within scrolls. His fūinjutsu was further increased upon receivingGerotoranear the start of the Fourth Shinobi World War.[103]In the anime, Jiraiya taught Narutocooperation ninjutsu, combining his techniques with others to create an even more powerful one.[104]The collaboration techniques he performed with other individuals typically utilised his own elemental affinity, such as theTyphoon Water Vortex TechniquewithYamato, theWind Release: Toad GunwithGamatatsu, and theScorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zerowith Sasuke. He also learned fromAsuma Sarutobitoflowchakra into his weapons to increase their offensive might.[105]In the anime, by adulthood, Naruto became able to use theShuriken Shadow Clone Technique,[106]and also showed some proficiency with bōjutsu.[107] Naruto using the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique. See also:Images of Naruto using Shadow Clone TechniqueNaruto's first trademark technique was theShadow Clone Technique. While originally failing constantly with a basic illusionary clone, after briefly studying theScroll of Seals, he learned to create shadow clones on amass scale. From then on, Naruto's skill with shadow clones blossomed to great heights. Having unusually high chakra reserves, Naruto could use this technique to create hundreds of shadow clones and retain large amounts of chakra in each one with relative ease.[108]He could use them to outnumber or deceive his enemies, manoeuvre himself in mid-air, transform into weapons, scout areas, or test an opponent's abilities.[109]During his elemental-affinity training, learning that the original will gain all the knowledge and conditioning of a shadow clone right after it dispersed. From this, Naruto can use his mass scale of clones to drastically speed up his training to gain years worth of experience in just days. By the time he became Hokage, Naruto's usage of this technique on mass-scale and prolonged-periods allowed him to constantly perform multiple simultaneous tasks throughout the village daily, although he does have a tendency to overexert himself, leaving him exhausted afterwards. Naruto using the Rasengan. Naruto's second trademark technique is theRasengan. Originally, due to his poor chakra control, Naruto had to use a shadow clone to form the spherical shape while he provided the chakra. Over time, Naruto developedlargerversionsof the Rasengan and learned how to perform it faster.[110]During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he learned to use the Rasengan and its variants unaided with a single hand, or even form one in both hands simultaneously.[111]He also increased the size of his standard Rasengan.[112]Naruto had also shown the ability to release the Rasengan as an energy wave,[21]or as a projectile in the anime.[113]Using senjutsu or Kurama's chakra, Naruto can createmorepowerfulandelaboratevariationsof the Rasengan; using the latter, he even developed theSuper Mini-Tailed Beast Ball, performing it in a similar manner to the Rasengan. In the anime, usage of his tailed beast chakra also allows him to instantly perform massive Rasengan without the aid of his hands and launch in quick successions, similar to aTailed Beast Ball.[114] Naruto simultaneously using Wind and Lava Release. Naruto's natural affinity isWind Release. Using shadow clones, one to form the Rasengan while another infuses the Wind chakra, Naruto could complete difficult task of producing a Rasengan that is the pinnacle of shape and nature transformation, something no one before him could accomplish, including Kakashi and his father. Once adjusting to using theWind Release: Rasenganhe could expand upon it to produce theWind Release: Rasenshuriken. He also createddifferent-sizedvariations, and could even usetwo Rasenshurikensimultaneously. Two years after its creation, he became skilled enough to form a Rasenshuriken without any shadow clones and throw it in his base form,[21]a feat which he previously could only do while using his enhanced modes. After acquiringSix Pathsabilities,[115]Naruto gains access to all five basicnature transformations, as well asYang Release.[116]He could temporarily utilizeYin–Yang Releaseto revitalize life-forces, heal whomever he touches, and restore missing organs.[117]After gaining chakra from the respective tailed beasts, Naruto can also useShukaku'sMagnet Release,Son Gokū'sLava Release, andKokuō'sBoil Release, able to infuse any of the other elements into is normal techniques as seamlessly as with Wind chakra. Having an arm made from Hashirama's cells, Naruto has a possibility to useWood Release.[118]"
How did Naruto learn to deceive his opponents?,faking defeat,Intelligence,"Naruto reveals himself after disguising as a Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. While headstrong and often acting without thinking, Naruto's years as a prankster had given him a cunning imagination that was useful in split-second decision making, which has repeatedly proved invaluable in battle. He is a remarkabletactile learner, able to learn better through executing a task rather than understanding the theory of it.[132][25]Jiraiya also considered him to have a good gambling instinct.[133]Once seen in action, even the likes of the Second Hokage revise their thoughts about Naruto's intellect and instinct in battle.[134]After meeting Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, Naruto gained the innate ability to grasp the nature of chakra and comprehend all universal things,[135]allowing him to quickly master the new powers he received. By adulthood he had become a capable teacher, instructing students at Konoha'sNinja Academy.[136][137]During his fight withDelta, Naruto showed his ability to think ahead by hiding his power and faking defeat in order to make Delta drop her guard and reveal her plans, although Delta was perceptive enough to see through his attempts. Naruto ultimately was able to find out the weakness of Delta'sShinobi-Wareabsorbing eye and overtax it after seeing it in action repeatedly.[80] Naruto's most famous mental skill is to deceive his opponents, as he made effective use of even the mostsimple techniquesto trick thedeadliest of opponents.[138]He could formulate multi-step plans or backup plans in the thick of battle,[139]and act quickly even when given new information.[140]He can also seemingly make himself predictable by creating a pattern, only to throw off his opponent by breaking it. He has even thrown in what others would callcompletely useless techniquesatpowerful opponentsto create an opening for a counterattack.[141]Naruto is rather observant, able to notice details others may overlook and subsequently take advantage of them to overcome his opponents.[142]As an adult, Naruto proved to be a capable teacher in ninjutsu, quickly teaching the basics toKawaki."
Who was Naruto assigned to Team 7 partnered with?,Sasuke Uchihaand Sakura Haruno,Prologue — land of waves,"Main article:Prologue — Land of Waves Naruto is protected by Iruka. Failing once again to graduate from theAcademy, a disappointed Naruto is advised by one of his instructors,Mizuki, to steal theScroll of Sealsand learn a technique from it in order to graduate. As Naruto struggled to learn theShadow Clone Technique,Iruka Uminotracked him down and realised that Naruto was tricked by Mizuki into stealing the scroll. Mizuki attacked them and told Naruto about the Nine-Tails sealed within him, claiming that Iruka hated him because of it. When Iruka risked his life to protect Naruto, however, he saw through Mizuki's lies and used theMultiple Shadow Clone Techniqueto defeat him, prompting Iruka to happily grant Naruto his graduation from the Academy. Naruto would later befriendKonohamaru Sarutobi, grandson of theThird Hokage, and teach him several perverted or useful techniques. Team 7's group photo. Naruto was eventually assigned toTeam 7, partnered withSasuke UchihaandSakura Harunounder the leadership ofKakashi Hatake. During their first meeting, Naruto shared his love of ramen, his hobbies, and his dream to become Hokage. To test their qualifications, Kakashi gave the team abell test, stating that whichever of the three takes one of the two bells on his person will officially becomegenin. Instead of hiding like Sakura and Sasuke, Naruto tried to take the bells from Kakashi by force, only to be easily defeated, hung upside-down from a tree and tied to a wooden post in an attempt to steal lunch. After Sakura and Sasuke fail as well, Kakashi explains that the goal of the test was to use teamwork, to do together what none of them could do by themselves. He is persuaded to allow them to try again after lunch, but instructs Sasuke and Sakura not to feed Naruto. They feed him anyway, needing him in top-form if they're to work together. Kakashi sees this and, because they care more about the team than listening to his instructions, allows them all to pass. Naruto and Sasuke team up against Zabuza. After a series of uneventfulD-rankmissions, Naruto is able to secure aC-rankmission for Team 7: escortingTazunato theLand of Waves. Soon after leaving Konoha, they are attacked by theDemon Brothers. Naruto is paralysed with fear, forcing Sasuke to step in to disarm them and protect Tazuna until Kakashi can capture them. Tazuna confesses that assassins have been hired to kill him but that he couldn't afford the bodyguard detail he needs. Although the mission is nowA-rankin nature - far beyond the skill of genin - Team 7 decides to continue with it. Angered by Sasuke's taunting of him, Naruto cuts his hand to bleed out the poison he received earlier, vowing to never waver again. When they arrive in theLand of Wavesand are confronted byZabuza Momochi, Naruto is overwhelmed by the battle between Kakashi and Zabuza before he is knocked aside by Zabuza'swater clone. Remembering his vow, Naruto regained his confidence and teamed up with Sasuke to free Kakashi from Zabuza'sWater Prison. In the end, Zabuza is seemingly killed byHaku, allowing Team 7 to escort Tazuna back to his house. Kakashi finds Zabuza's death suspicious and decides to train the team in case he returns. He has them perform theTree Climbing Practiceto improve their chakra control, which will help them against Zabuza. Naruto becomes frustrated after several failures and asks for advice from Sakura, who herself mastered it from the start. Now rapidly improving, Naruto competes with Sasuke to finish the training, each determined to outdo the other. One day, Naruto encounters Haku and they each discussed their dreams and desire to protect those precious to them. After Haku leaves, Naruto finishes the training with Sasuke but is left exhausted, so Team 7 leaves him behind the next morning as they resume their escort duties. Naruto awakens and arrives to assist Team 7 in fighting Zabuza and Haku, but, unaware of how Haku'sDemonic Mirroring Ice Crystalswork, he joins Sasuke within the prison. Naruto's first use of the Nine-Tails' chakra. Naruto cannot break free with his shadow clones and Sasuke cannot melt the ice with his fire. As Haku moves in to kill Naruto, Sasuke uses his body as a shield to protect Naruto and seemingly dies. Enraged by Sasuke's apparent death, Naruto unwittingly accesses theNine-Tails' chakrafor the first time, allowing him to destroy the ice mirrors and defeat Haku, breaking his mask. Realising his opponent was the boy he met before, Naruto calms himself. He is asked by Haku to kill him, since he feels of no further use to Zabuza. Before Naruto can do so, Haku immediately stops him and goes off to save Zabuza from being killed by Kakashi, sacrificing his own life. When Zabuza refuses to appreciate this, Naruto angrily scolds him, stating that Haku gave up his life to save someone precious to him. Touched by his words, Zabuza, using Naruto's kunai, killed Gatō and many of his henchmen before he himself dies. Sasuke soon awakens, and when their injuries heal, Team 7 leaves for home via Tazuna's newly-constructedGreat Naruto Bridge."

Naruto escaped and found aSelf-Repairing Barrier, preventing him from leaving by himself. B, at Iruka's request, decided to join him, and together they broke through the barrier. Naruto states his resolve to the Nine-Tails. Shortly after, the Nine-Tails pulled Naruto into his subconscious, berating him for squandering its chakra and calling him naive for thinking he could stop the war by himself. When the Nine-Tails failed to once again tempt Naruto with power, the fox went off to claim that his attempt to put an end to hatred was futile, using his history with Sasuke as proof.

Itachi joined Naruto and B in fighting Nagato, first by neutralising theRinnegan Summoningand then saving them from being killed by Nagato. Nagato, his personality now suppressed, tried capturing them withChibaku Tensei, which the three combined efforts to destroy. While Nagato was distracted by their attack, Itachi sealed him withSusanoo. His personality restored, Nagato used his last moments to apologise and put his faith in Naruto.

When Naruto noticed that the Raikage had a scar from his fight with the Eight-Tails years earlier, he contacted it via B to ask how the Raikage received the scar. Upon hearing the Eight-Tails' answer, Naruto surmises the scar was self-inflicted, confirming it as he manipulates the Third into piercing his own body. The Third is sealed and Naruto regroups with the Tsuchikage and Gaara, who already defeated the Second Mizukage. As Naruto and B continued onwards, Naruto's shadow clones started arriving at various locations.

Who did Madara drop a meteorite on?,Tobi,Fourth shinobi world war: climax,"Main article:Fourth Shinobi World War: ClimaxShadow clones arrived at all the remaining battlefields, securing Impure World Reincarnations, weeding out the Zetsu that had infiltrated the Alliance's ranks, and defeating any other remaining Zetsu. Victory seemed near when theSensor Divisiondetected a new threat near the Fourth Division: Mu, whosplithimself before his sealing, and the reincarnatedMadara Uchiha. Shocked by this revelation, they all wondered who the masked man,Tobi, really was. Madara gave them little time to discuss it and attacked them immediately. He cut swaths through the Fourth Division's ranks and used his Rinnegan to avoid the clone's, the Tsuchikage's, and Gaara's counterattack. Wishing to eliminate them all at once, Madaradropped a meteoriteon them. Naruto receives help from the Nine-Tails. While the survivors regroup, Madara tried tosummonthe Nine-Tails. Although it failed, the fox sensed the attempt and offered somechakrato help fight Madara, preferring Naruto over the Uchiha. The shadow clone used the Nine-Tails' chakra to counter Madara'sNativity of a World of TreeswithBig Ball Spiralling Serial Zone Spheres, though the extended fighting left the clone exhausted afterwards. Madara moved in to capture it, but was parried by the arrival of Tsunade, the Fourth Raikage, and theFifth Mizukage. The Five Kage vowed to deal with Madara themselves and asked that Naruto should instead focus on defeating Tobi. The clone dispersed just as the real Naruto converged on Tobi. Naruto and B clashed with Tobi's reincarnatedjinchūriki, styled like aSix Paths of Pain. During the fighting, Naruto referenced another Madara and asked who Tobi really was. Realising his lie was exposed, Tobi refused to accept any particular identity, believing it to be irrelevant. Naruto was not satisfied with this answer and vowed to break Tobi's mask. Naruto and B clash with the reincarnated jinchūriki. B enteredTailed Beast Modeto clear the surrounding forest that was giving him and Naruto a disadvantage against the reincarnated jinchūriki. He then tried tosealthe jinchūriki, but Tobi had them enterVersion 2forms to escape at the last second. The increased strength of the jinchūriki caused difficulties for Naruto and B. Tobi, taking advantage of the situation, nearly captured Naruto, but was blocked by the arrival of Kakashi and Guy. Their arrival balanced out the two sides, so Tobi had theFour-Tailsand theSix-Tailsenter Tailed Beast Modes as well. The Four-Tails captured Naruto in its mouth, allowing it to communicate with him. The Four-Tails, introducing itself with the name Son Gokū, was angered to be controlled by Tobi, but it doubted Naruto would be any better since humans had always sought to control it and its fellow tailed beasts. Naruto insisted he was different and Son Gokū, touched by his desire to help it, told him how to release it from Tobi's control. Naruto managed to break out of its mouth, locate theblack receiver, and remove it. Naruto and Kurama unite. Son Gokū thanked Naruto for his help, but explained that it couldn't actually be saved, as it was still bound to theDemonic Statue of the Outer Path. Before it was pulled back into the Demonic Statue, Son Gokū gave some of its chakra to Naruto and wished him luck. Tobi, having lost the use of one tailed beast, forced the others to enter Tailed Beast Modes so that the battle could be brought to an end. The Nine-Tails remarked that Naruto couldn't possibly win without its help. Naruto stated that he was not up for taking its chakra by force at the moment and that he would figure something out. However, Naruto's earlier determination to help Son Gokū moved the Nine-Tails, reminding it of the many selfless things Naruto had done during his life and the perseverance he always displayed. The Nine-Tails no longer wanted to oppose Naruto and instead offered to join him as a partner, asking only that Naruto call it by name: Kurama. Naruto meets the tailed beasts. Naruto entered his own Tailed Beast Mode and went to save Kakashi and Guy, deflecting the other five beasts' Tailed Beast Balls. The Kurama avatar fought the beasts in close combat, forcing them to combine their Tailed Beast Balls into one against it. Kurama countered theirs with a single one of its own Tailed Beast Balls and Naruto then used the avatar's tails to grab and remove the beasts' black receivers. From the contact, Naruto was able to interface with the other beasts, who introduced themselves and, like Son Gokū, gave him portions of their chakra. Tobi recalled the beasts back into the Demonic Statue and, though irritated, remained confident in his eventual victory as he faced off with Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy. By the time night fell, however, Tobi was still unable to defeat them. A light eventually descended on the reincarnated jinchūriki that B had kept restrained, returning them to the afterlife and signalling that Itachi had finally defeated Kabuto. Naruto destroys Tobi's mask. With his options running out, Tobi deposited theBenihisagoand theKohaku no Jōhei into the Demonic Statue which, combined with a fragment of the Eight-Tails,Gyūki's, chakra he acquired previously, was enough to start the revival of theTen-Tails. Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy started focusing on destroying it, but were constantly stopped by Tobi and his peculiar teleportation and intangibility abilities. From the fighting, however, Kakashi noticed that Tobi's abilities were seemingly linked to his ownKamui. To take advantage of this, Kakashi had one of Naruto's shadow clones attack Tobi and, just as the clone was about to be destroyed by one of Tobi's attacks, Kakashi used Kamui on it without Tobi noticing. Naruto then attacked with a Tailed Beast Ball, which Tobi escaped by retreating toKamui's dimension. He found the clone waiting for him there and it destroyed his mask with a Rasengan. When they saw his face, Guy and Kakashi recognised Tobi as their childhood friend,Obito Uchiha, whom they'd long thought dead. Obito declined to explain his actions to them and instead attacked, which attracted Madara, who escaped the release of the Impure World Reincarnation, to their location. Seeing Madara, Naruto asked what happened to the Kage, to which the elder Uchiha replied that they were in bad condition when he left them. From that and the conversation he overheard between Madara and Obito, particularly their manipulation of Nagato, Naruto attacked in a rage. Madara reflected him and then tried to capture him and B so that the Ten-Tails could be revived in its complete form. Naruto split his attention, he and B fighting Madara'swood dragonwith their Tailed Beast Modes and one of his shadow clones trying to help Kakashi get over the revelation that Obito was alive. Naruto with the Allied Shinobi Forces. Obito tried to convince Naruto of the futility of resistance. Naruto insisted that protecting his comrades was always worthwhile, no matter how hopeless things may seem. His words brought Kakashi out of his slump, enabling him to start fighting Obito on his own, and energised Guy, who created an opening for Naruto and B to attack the Demonic Statue with a combined Tailed Beast Ball. The attack came too late, however, and the Ten-Tails was revived. Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy regrouped and coordinated an attack, but the Ten-Tails was too powerful and Madara and Obito, once they linked themselves to it, were able to deploy its powers effectively. Just before they could kill Naruto and the others, the combined remaining Allied Shinobi Forces arrived to help. Shikaku Nara, communicating to all of them from the Alliance's headquarters, staged an offensive to restrain the Ten-Tails. Although it failed, it was effective enough that Madara and Obito had the Ten-Tails destroy the distant headquarters, killing Shikaku and everyone else stationed there. The Allies made individual attacks against the Ten-Tails, but none had any effect. At the same time, the Ten-Tails started raining wooden skewers all over the battlefield, killing many. When one was about to hit Naruto,Hinatashielded him with her body andNejishielded her with his own. Dying, Neji collapsed on Naruto's shoulder, asking him to be more careful in the future since many lives, Hinata's particularly, now depend on his. With his last breath, he thanked Naruto for calling him a genius all those years ago. Naruto was deeply distraught by Neji's death, which Obito tried to use as an example of the needless death that resistance caused and that could be solved in the new world he wanted to create. Hinata brought Naruto back to his senses by reminding him of all the people who had given their lives to protect him and whose memories he would be insulting if he had given up now. As Naruto thanked her, he took her hand and coated her with some of Kurama's chakra. Naruto gives chakra to the Allied Shinobi Forces. Naruto shared Kurama's chakra throughout the Allied Forces, increasing their strength and protecting them from harm. They all manoeuvred into a formation that Shikaku was able to communicate to them before he died and, taking the form of a bird in memory of Neji, successfully removed the Ten-Tails from Obito and Madara's control. Forced to fend for themselves, Obito sought out Naruto, criticising him for wasting his energy protecting others. Naruto replied that protecting them actually gave him strength, motivating everyone within earshot. They then sensed the Ten-Tails was about to attack, which Kakashi tried to stop with Kamui. Obito intercepted him and they teleported away, leaving the others to endure the Ten-Tails'Tenpenchii. Kurama's chakra protected everyone, but it faded in the aftermath; Naruto was left quite beaten up, requiring Sakura to heal him. When the Ten-Tails attacked with another Tailed Beast Ball, the Allies mustered what little defence they could. Before it could reach them, however, the Tailed Beast Ball was suddenly teleported away and Naruto's reincarnated father,Minato Namikaze, appeared at Naruto's side. Team 7 reunites. TheFirst,Second, andThird Hokagearrived soon afterward and, along with Minato, erected a barrier around the Ten-Tails to confine it. Sasuke arrived shortly too, at whose request the previous Hokage were reincarnated byOrochimaruand who now opposed Obito and Madara. Their fellowRookie Ninehad set aside their differences with Sasuke for the time being and joined forces in launching an attack against the Ten-Tails'cruft. On Sai's advice, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura all summoned their signature animals in order to focus directly on the Ten-Tails itself. Naruto and Sasuke successfully damaged the Ten-Tails' arm with a combinedScorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero, but it merely removed the arm to prevent the flames of Sasuke'sAmaterasufrom spreading. Before they could attack again, Obito returned, landing on top of the Ten-Tails head and seemingly about to use theSamsara of Heavenly Life Techniqueto restore Madara to life. While everyone focused on stopping Obito, Naruto couldn't help but notice that thehand sealshe was using were different from what Nagato used. Minato tried to cut Obito down, but discovered that it was too late as he sealed the Ten-Tails into his body, becoming its jinchūriki."
Who attacked Obito after discovering his weakness?,Naruto,Birth of the ten-tails' jinchūriki,"Main article:Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki Naruto and Sasuke attack Obito. Obito used his new power to destroy the barrier, forcing the Hokage to put the energy they were using toward the barrier into the fight instead. Because they had immortal bodies, they launched the first attack so that the others could learn what they could about Obito's new abilities, but they were quickly defeated. Naruto and Sasuke engaged him as well, but were nearly killed, saved only by Naruto using hischakra armsto link to Minato so he could teleport them to safety. Just as before, Naruto and Sasuke combined their attacks, having Minato and the Second Hokage coordinate teleports so that the attack would connect. Obito'sTruth-Seeking Ballsdissipated much of the attack and the damage that he did incur was quickly regenerated. Naruto attacks Obito after discovering his weakness. From the development and some of the previous exchanges, Minato concluded that Obito was able to neutraliseninjutsu. Gamakichi, wanting to make some final contribution to the fight before he was forced to return toMount Myōboku, attacked with hisStarch Syrup Gun. Minato took this opportunity to try and reason with Obito, reminding him of his former dream to become Hokage. Obito berated the title and those who had held it, as he had surpassed them. Naruto was insulted not only because that was a slight against his father, but also because he hadn't abandoned his dream of being Hokage like Obito had. The Second Hokage teleported him to Obito and he attacked with a Rasengan, which successfully damaged Obito; Naruto noticed that Gamakichi's attack wasn't neutralised and realised Obito was vulnerable tosenjutsu. Kurama and its jinchūriki join forces. With a weakness discovered, Obito trapped the Alliance in abarrierand began charging multiple Tailed Beast Balls that he would use to wipe out everyone within its confines. Minato noted that he wouldn't be able to teleport them all away in time, so Naruto came up with a different approach: he linked his chakra with Minato and remotely restored the Alliance's chakra cloaks, networking everyone in with Minato'sFlying Thunder God Technique, allowing him to teleport everyone out of the barrier. Minato did so and was afterwards very proud of his son, saying he wished they had more time to talk. Naruto replied that it was not necessary since he already methis motherand that she explained everything. Naruto and Minato each entered Tailed Beast Modes, with Naruto merging his with Sage Mode in order to imbue their shared Rasengan with senjutsu. The Second teleported them to Obito and they attacked, but he blocked it with his Truth-Seeking Balls. A senjutsu-enhanced Naruto and Sasuke attack Obito. To move ahead with his plans, Obito created a replica of theGod Tree, the first step in performing theInfinite Tsukuyomi. The tree started absorbing chakra from those nearby until they die, a fate that Naruto nearly succumbed to until he was saved by the Third Hokage. Obito pointed to the growing number of casualties as further evidence that Naruto should stop resisting, an argument that Naruto was increasingly having trouble ignoring. Sasuke, unmoved by Obito's words, used Susanoo to hack through the tree and then mocked Naruto for giving up. Naruto was reminded of his desire to not lose Sasuke or anyone else for that matter and, reinvigorated, joined Sasuke in the offensive. Although their senjutsu-enhanced Tailed Beast Mode and Susanoo could compete with Obito, they were individually unable to defeat him. Obito continued trying to convince Naruto to stop, but he ignored him. Naruto and Sasuke slash through Obito. Sasuke then coated his Susanoo around Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode, granting the Kurama-avatar a sword and armour. Sensing that it was the final exchange, Obito created asword and shieldof his own out of Truth-Seeking Balls. Naruto created a Rasengan in each of the Kurama-avatar's tails, which his friends from Konoha guide in a coordinated assault to Obito's shield, destroying it. As soon as Naruto and Sasuke sliced through Obito with their sword, the tailed beasts then began to emerge from the Uchiha's body, giving Naruto and the combined Allied Shinobi Forces the opportunity to pull them out. The tug-of-war for the tailed beasts linked Naruto's consciousness with Obito's. Naruto reminded Obito of his earlier claim that he was nobody and set out to prove to him that he was Obito Uchiha, specifically the Obito Uchiha that Kakashi used to know. Naruto pointed out their similarities, how both were orphans and that, because of that, they wanted to be Hokage. Obito agreed that they were similar, but that was the reason why he has been trying so hard to convince Naruto that he was right, and insisted that the world he wanted to create was a better one because his vision of the future was clear, whereas the future of the current world was ambiguous. Naruto argued that was the point and that uncertainty, when faced with comrades, was worthwhile, and offered Obito his hand so that they might see what happened together. Kurama is extracted from Naruto by Madara. The Allies successfully removed the tailed beasts from Obito and he fell to the ground, defeated. Minato and Kakashi insisted that Obito be left to them while Naruto and the rest of the Alliance should focus on Madara. They did so, joining forces with the First Hokage against him, but right before he could seal him, Madara put one final fail-safe into effect: he hadBlack Zetsuforce Obito to revive him. Madara quickly neutralised the First, fended off Naruto, Sasuke, and Sai, and then went after the freed tailed beasts. Naruto entered Tailed Beast Mode and assisted them with fighting him off. They were initially successful, but when Madara reacquired one of hisRinnegan, he easily defeated them withLimbo: Border Jail, sealing them all back into the Demonic Statue, including B's Gyūki and Naruto's Kurama. Obito transfers his tailed beasts' chakra into Naruto. The removal of Kurama from his body caused Naruto to pass out and placed his life in immediate danger. HisUzumakiheritage prevented him from dying instantly, but he required constant medical attention from Sakura in order to keep him alive. On the advice of Kurama right before it was extracted, Gaara took Naruto to Minato so that Minato's portion of Kurama's chakra could be sealed into him, saving him. Kakashi sent Naruto and Sakura toKamui's dimensionso that she could continue performing life support without interruption. Obito soon arrived to help her, having overcome both Black Zetsu and Madara in order to acquire Minato's half of Kurama and give it to Naruto, as his form of penance. Naruto and Sasuke accept Hagoromo's power. While on the border of life and death, Naruto was met by the Sage of Six Paths,Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. He explained his past conflicts with his mother,Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, and the conflicts that emerged between his sons,AsuraandIndra. His sons' conflict had continued through the centuries, with their chakra reincarnated every generation in new individuals to fight anew; Naruto was the current reincarnation of Asura, while Sasuke was the reincarnation of Indra. Naruto was not greatly surprised, having sensed something like that when he met Sasuke during theFive Kage Summit. Because of Madara's aims for the world, Hagoromo asked that he and Sasuke join forces to stop him, a task he was only encouraged by from the tailed beasts' positive words concerning Naruto. He gave Naruto theSix Paths Yang Power,half his chakraandSix Paths Sage Modeto help him in this goal. Naruto and Sasuke strike Madara. When Naruto woke up, he had Obito send him back to the real world. There, he stopped Madara from killing Might Guy and used Hagoromo's power to stabilise Guy's life force from using theEight Gates Released Formation. Surprised by Naruto's sudden increase in power, Madara was hit by Naruto'sSage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken, which was fueled by Son Gokū's chakra and instantly cut down the giant tree Obito created earlier. When Sasuke arrived, Naruto enteredSix Paths Sage Modeand they started overwhelming Madara. Realising his window was closing, Madara went after Kakashi and took his Mangekyō Sharingan, using it to follow Obito. Sakura appeared shortly afterward, sent by Obito so Madara wouldn't kill her. She could do nothing about Kakashi's eye, so Naruto used Hagoromo's power to restore the one he lost years ago. Naruto's clones facing Madara's clones. Madara soon returned, now having both his Rinnegan and Black Zetsu in control of Obito's body. Naruto and Sasuke immediately resumed their attack, but Madara had an easier time with them. He rose into the sky, rainingChibaku Tenseion them to keep them busy while he projected theInfinite Tsukuyomion the world. While Naruto destroyed the remaining satellite-like constructs, Sasuke shielded him, Sakura, and Kakashi with Susanoo from the Infinite Tsukuyomi's gaze. He let them out once the illusion was finished casting and they emerged to find themselves alone, with the rest of the world being wrapped into Madara'sGod: Nativity of a World of Trees. As Madara confronted them and started explaining how he had saved the world, he was stabbed in the back by Black Zetsu. Black Zetsu then transferred to Madara's body from Obito's and forced him to absorb the world's chakra, converting him into a woman that Naruto and Sasuke recognised as Kaguya Ōtsutsuki."
What is the name of Kaguya's son?,Hagoromo,Kaguya ōtsutsuki strikes,"Main article:Kaguya Ōtsutsuki StrikesKaguya detected that Naruto and Sasuke as the reincarnations of Asura and Indra, and also that her son Hagoromo had given them the power to defeat her. Not wanting to further the damage the world that their fighting would cause, sheshiftedthem all to one ofher dimensions, placing them above a sea of lava. Sasuke summoned hishawkGarudato save himself and Naruto, but ignored Naruto's pleas to save Sakura, Kakashi, and Obito too since only he and Naruto were vital to the fight. Kakashi was able to briefly stop their fall, but the heat burned the scroll he used to save them and it was only Naruto's sudden discovery that he was able to levitate that saved them from the lava. He left a shadow clone to hold onto them and engaged Kaguya, creating an opening for Sasuke to attack. Kaguya thwarts Naruto and Sasuke's sealing attempt. Sasuke's attack failed and Naruto must save him from the lava. With their attacks ineffective and the environment such a hazard, Naruto and Sasuke discussed what to do. Kaguya appeared behind them and paralysed them, binding them with Black Zetsu while she started absorbing their chakra. Black Zetsu took the opportunity to expand on the history earlier given by Hagoromo, painting Kaguya as the victim of her sons, Hagoromo andHamura. Black Zetsu had for centuries been manipulating others toward the outcome of reviving her, and only then had it finally succeeded. It encouraged them to bask in the embrace of their oblivion, but Naruto refused, breaking himself and Sasuke free. Needing to take drastic action, Naruto used his ""ultimate"" jutsu:Sexy: Reverse Harem Technique. Kaguya was so distracted that she was nearly sealed, but she recomposed herself in time to shift dimensions again, freezing Naruto and Sasuke in place. Naruto overwhelms Kaguya with shadow clones. Because Naruto and Sasuke were only a threat to her when together, KaguyasentSasuke to a different dimension while she focused on Naruto. While Kaguya manipulated the ice dimension against him, his shadow clone explained to Kakashi, Sakura, and the now-awake Obito that his and Sasuke's powers were both necessary to defeat her. Obito offered to use his Kamui to try and explore Kaguya's dimensions to find Sasuke. To give Obito an opening, Naruto usedNaruto Region Comboto overwhelm Kaguya, forcing her to retreat to another dimension to get her bearings. When she did so, Obito infiltrated the dimension Kaguya went to with Sakura and the shadow clone. The shadow clone faced her so that she wouldn't notice them while they look for Sasuke. Kaguya returned to the ice dimension and resumed her fight with the army of Naruto's clones. He kept her preoccupied until Obito returned with Sasuke. Naruto separates Black Zetsu from Kaguya. Increasingly frustrated, Kaguya shifted them to another dimension with powerful gravity to immobilise Naruto and Sasuke while she attacked with herAll-Killing Ash Bones. Kakashi and Obito used themselves to shield the attack, with Obito then using Kamui to protect Kakashi, leaving Obito unable to defend himself. Naruto tried to heal the damage to his body, but even Hagoromo's power couldn't save him. While Sasuke fought Kaguya, Obito thanked Naruto for reminding him of who he was and made him promise to become Hokage for both their sakes. Naruto agreed and Obito's body crumbled. Black Zetsu ridiculed Obito for living an insignificant life and dying an insignificant death. Enraged, Naruto severed Kaguya's arm, in the sleeve of which Black Zetsu had been hiding, and then pinned it to the ground with his Truth-Seeking Balls. Team 7 defeats Kaguya. Naruto and his shadow clones attacked Kaguya withSage Art: Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken. On impact, the tailed beasts' chakra within her began reacting and Kaguya started losing control of her form. She was able to reconfigure herself and prepared anExpansive Truth-Seeking Ballto destroy them. Kakashi interfered, using Susanoo to make an opening for Naruto and Sasuke. She tried to escape, but Sakura punched her to keep her in place, allowing Naruto and Sasuke to triggerSix Paths — Chibaku Tensei. The tailed beasts were removed from her, Madara was spat out, and she was entombed in her own dimension. Not wanting Black Zetsu to scheme for her release again, Naruto made a point to trap it with her but not before telling it that a spoiled brat like it has no right to compare itself with the men and women who truly shaped shinobi history. Minato wishes happy birthday to Naruto. Team 7 wondered how they would return to their world. Sensing their need, Hagoromo combined the efforts of the dead Kage to summon them, the tailed beasts, and Madara back. Hagoromo thanked them for saving the world, as did the tailed beasts for saving them. Naruto happily greeted to his original Kurama, asking if it missed him, to which the flustered fox denied. After Madara died from his ordeal, Naruto met with Minato who, as day broke, wished him a happy seventeenth birthday. As Hagoromo returned Minato's and the souls of the other dead Kage to thePure Land, Minato voiced his pride in Naruto and promised to tell Kushina everything about him. The other Kage also gave words of parting, which Naruto tearfully accepted. With all threats gone, Hagoromo explained that the Infinite Tsukuyomi could be released if Naruto and Sasuke combine their chakra. Sasuke agreed to this, but first he wanted to kill the Kage and destroy the tailed beasts, believing both were inhibitive to world peace. When he was unwilling to back down from his threat, the tailed beasts moved in to stop Sasuke, but he captured each in their own Chibaku Tensei. Hagoromo recognised that as a continuation of Indra's feud with Asura, but lacked the time and power to do anything about it. Sakura tried to reason with Sasuke, but he knocked her out and left. Naruto followed after him, promising to Hagoromo that he would bring him around and finally end the centuries-long feud. Naruto and Sasuke begin their rematch at the Valley of the End. Naruto and Sasuke ended up at theValley of the End, where they fought years ago. Sasuke stated his willingness to bear the world's burdens by himself and live independently of the past, neither of which Naruto believed were possible, or at least wise. He tells Sasuke it's impossible to do everything alone like he plans to, pointing to the missteps Itachi made and their own successful teamwork against Kaguya. Sasuke replies that he only wants to remake a better world, one where he can, like Itachi before, be solely responsible for the difficult decisions that must be made so that nobody else needs to; this is what he believes a true ""Hokage"" to be. Naruto insists he will be Hokage, not Sasuke, because Sasuke is still going against what Itachi wanted for him and they start fighting. Naruto and Sasuke's attacks collide. After a brief exchange of blows reminiscent of their fight years ago, Naruto and Sasuke started trading punches with their Tailed Beast Mode and Susanoo respectively. Sasuke chastised Naruto for not attacking with an intent to kill, but Naruto, like last time, was unwilling to do so, not wishing for either of them to go without the other. Naruto then clashed his Tailed Beast Ball with Sasuke's Susanoo-supported Chidori, producing a large explosion that does noticeable but not debilitating damage to their respective avatars. Each therefore powered up the avatars, Sasuke by channelling the captured tailed beasts into his Susanoo and Naruto by merging his avatar with the avatars of two shadow clones. The two met attacks once again, creating a giant explosion that stripped away their avatars and left them with too little chakra to use practically. They instead resorted totaijutsu, kicking and punching each other into the night. Naruto and Sasuke's final clash. As the two battled near exhaustion, Kurama mustered enough chakra for Naruto to make one last attack, but Sasukeabsorbedit. Having expected this, Naruto delivered a solid punch, finally irritating Sasuke over the endless repetition of their fight. Kurama gave the last of its chakra to Naruto, who used it to make a Rasengan to counter Sasuke's Chidori. Both woke up later to find that much of the Valley of the End had been destroyed, that they had each lost an arm, and that neither could move. Sasuke reflected that Naruto had been a constant obstacle to his goals, but that he was also the only person who never given up on him. Naruto's usual response that they were friends didn't convince Sasuke since it obviously went beyond, so Naruto elaborated that he experienced pain if he didn't have Sasuke. Sasuke was awed, knowing full well that Naruto had experienced various misfortunes in his life, smiled through all of them, yet would suffer without Sasuke. Naruto and Sasuke reconnect. When they woke up the next day, Sasuke admitted defeat for the first time in his life, as he came to accept that Naruto was just as vital to him as he was to Naruto. Kakashi and Sakura eventually tracked them down and Sakura healed them, though she couldn't do anything about their missing arms. Once they were able to walk, they returned to where the Allied Shinobi Forces were all trapped still, dispelled the Infinite Tsukuyomi according to Hagoromo's instructions, and Sasuke released the tailed beasts. With the war over, Naruto returns to the village, where he attends a mass funeral for the participants of the war. In the anime, while recovering from his injuries, Gaara and A approach Naruto and thank him for his effort during the war. Shikamaru later brings Naruto to the Academy to meet with Iruka and Kakashi, who is considering on promoting Naruto as a jōnin. However, because he never got to retake the Chūnin Exams, Naruto has to complete two years worth of studies, much to his dismay. However, Naruto is cheered up as Iruka offers to help him.[153]"
What was Naruto's profession?,Hokage,Kakashi hiden: lightning in the icy sky,"Main article:Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy SkyNearly a year after the end of theFourth Shinobi World War, Naruto and Sai were sent to theLand of Wavesto captureGaryō, leader of theRyūha Armament Alliance. Once they located the Alliance's hideout, Naruto launched an assault with multiple shadow clones; although he was still missing an arm, he had learned how to perform one-handedhand seals. He easily dealt with most of the Alliance's members, but was briefly stalled by theIce Releaseof Garyō'sbodyguard. Naruto distracted the bodyguard with a shadow clone for long enough to apprehend Garyō. Garyō tried to convince Naruto that the Alliance was doing good work by releasing the world from money's corruptive influence. Although sympathetic, Naruto couldn't abide their terrorist actions and escaped with Garyō on Sai'sbird. At some point within the next two months, Naruto received a prosthetic arm to replace the one he lost during the war. While eating atRamen Ichirakuone day, he saw Kakashi walking by and asked him when he would officially take on the responsibilities of Hokage. He tried to convince Kakashi by listing the many shortcomings of Tsunade, unaware that she was standing behind him; she angrily knocked Naruto unconscious. Kakashi finally accepted the Hokage position shortly after the mission involving the Ryūha Armament Alliance and theBlood Prison. When Naruto learned about the mission, specifically that he was expressly forbidden from being informed about it at the time, Naruto started spreading rumours about Kakashi's relationship with the Blood Prison's new warden,Kahyō. Kakashi angrily attacked him and then bought him some ramen to apologise."
Who did Naruto ask where he was?,Temari,Shikamaru hiden: a cloud drifting in silent darkness,"Main articles:Shikamaru Hiden andShikamaru Hiden Naruto ran intoShikamaruearly one morning and they discussed their heavy workloads for theShinobi Union. Since Naruto's assignments were given to him by Shikamaru, he took the opportunity to complain. Shikamaru explained that Naruto, a prime candidate for an eventual Hokage position, needed to get used to it. Naruto later discussed what Shikamaru had said withSakura, having sensed that there was something Shikamaru was keeping from him. Sakura reminded Naruto of all the work Shikamaru did to prepare Naruto for becoming Hokage and that it likely had something to do with that. Naruto was aware of all that Shikamaru did on his behalf, but wondered if he was worth Shikamaru's trouble. A few days later, Naruto was approached byTemari, who was worried about Shikamaru's recent behaviour and now asked where he was. Naruto didn't know, and was troubled to find that neither didChōjiorIno. He finally asked Kakashi, who admitted under pressure that Shikamaru was on a secret assignment to theLand of Silence. Naruto joined Temari's team ofSunaninja to go to the Land of Silence to provide assistance to Shikamaru. They interrogated the locals upon arrival and learned that Shikamaru had been captured by theEnlightened Ones. They attacked the prison where Shikamaru was being held and successfully freed him, enabling him to complete his mission by taking the country's leader,Gengo, into custody. Afterwards, Naruto demanded that Shikamaru never keep anything from him again, otherwise their future Hokage—advisor relationship would be very problematic. Shikamaru agreed and apologised.

Urashiki deliberately held back on Naruto, hoping to anger him enough into unleashing the Nine-Tails' chakra. His efforts ultimately succeeded when Jiraiya took a hit that was intended for Naruto, triggering his transformation. Boruto, however, managed to reach Naruto and together were able to perfect theirnew collaboration technique. With the combined effort of Jiraiya and Sasuke, the two kids were able to plough through Urashiki's final attack and obliterate him. After the battle, both Naruto and Boruto lose consciousness due to their exhaustion. Days after Naruto and Boruto recovered at the Konoha hospital, he was upset to hear that Boruto and Sasuke would be leaving now that their mission was completed. Before they left, Naruto gave Boruto a gift. Sasuke used his Sharingan toeraseeveryone's memories of the events to preserve the timeline. On seeing the Sharingan, Naruto had what appeared to be a brief moment of recognising Sasuke before losing consciousness. Upon the pair returning, Naruto was approached by Sasuke who explained the recent situation he and Boruto had. Naruto was amazed at such a tale. Later, while visiting Jiraiya's grave to pay his respect, he was approached by Boruto, who decided to share with Naruto the gift of special ramen given by his past self. Sometime later, Sumire was officially transferred to theScientific Ninja Weapons Team. Naruto reached out to the Land of Iron and requested an exchange student to take Sumire's spot onTeam 15. Shikamaru was concerned about his experimental move of mixing shinobi with samurai, but Naruto insisted it would help close the gap between the two.

Afterwards the summit ended. Naruto was told then by Shikamaru that the reason why Kurotsuchi was acting that way was because she was being pressured by the Earth Daimyō to invade the Land of Flowers for the corps they had to offer and expressed sadness that Kurotsuchi didn't tell them as he believed that the Shinobi Union would have definitely aided her when it came to food scarcity and other issues and the potential of another war, remembering the casualties of the last war and not wanting to use and introduce the next generation to the horrors of war. Naruto found hope, however, when Shikamaru said they could negotiate with her so the invasion won't happen.[65] Unfortunately, in the next Kage Summit, Naruto's revelation of Kurotsuchi's true intentions only causeDaruito angrily threaten to kill Kurotsuchi and to add things worse, Naruto and Sasuke's strength were used as a boon for Kurotsuchi's cause, as they had the power to take over the continent and the imbalance in strength between Konoha and the other villages were thus immense. Despite Naruto's attempts to ensure Konoha would not try to take over the world, Shikamaru responded by paralysing and threatening to crush Kurotsuchi's neck, much to Naruto's horror and fury. Quickly, Naruto used his chakra to break out of Shikamaru's shadow and angrily put Shikamaru in place before attempting to plea for peace but he could not sway Kurotsuchi or Darui, who made it clear they would go to war if the invasion were to occur. Furious over the outcome, Naruto angrily confronted Shikamaru when they walked home but was rebuffed by his friend, who told him to think with his head and start responding harshly enough.[65] Several months after the Hōzuki Castle mission, Naruto discussed Katasuke being under mind control with Sai and Ibiki, and had them continue their investigation while Shikamaru handled Katasuki. Afterwards,Mirai Sarutobiinformed Naruto that Team Konohamaru successfully captured the Mujina Bandits, much to his joy. AsShojojiwas discussed, Naruto told everyone that they had to hurry up and handle themissing-nin.[158]Shikamaru then informed Naruto of his upcoming meeting with theFire DaimyōIkkyū Madoka, which Naruto had forgotten was later during the day.

Upon their return, they learned that Kara had long ago abandoned their facility in Amegakure and were performing biological experiments. They also learned that there were in fact civilians who sympathised with Kara and its goals. Naruto was concerned to learn that Amegakure was in shambles as it had yet to make any recovery since the Fourth Shinobi World War. He was determined to help the village. Naruto learned thatVictor, the president of theLand of Valleys' premiere medical and research company, was a member ofKarawho somehow obtained a sample of the First Hokage's cells.

Upon Konohamaru and Mugino's return, Konoha leadership discussed how to handle Kara, having learned influential figures like Victor were associated with the organisation and finding evidence in their investigation that Kara had spies all around. While many considered closing off the gates to Konohagakure to stop the flow of information, Naruto was torn on this, valuing the new peace between the village and the rest of the world. After talking various officials in the village, and witnessing Boruto and his friends work on an experiment to improve wireless communications, Naruto decided to not close the gates as it would deter cooperation with the outside world, instead deciding to reinforce security."

During the match, Narutodefendshimself from Boruto, and uses the invention to absorb hisson'stechniques, before defeating him with a single kick. Afterwards at the Hokage's office, Naruto informs Boruto of the technology he used against him, which angered Boruto. Before Naruto could explain himself, Sasuke arrives and interrupts their conversation, calming Boruto down by pointing out the need for them with the coming danger of enemies like theŌtsutsuki Clan. Naruto also admitted to knowing about Boruto's mark on his right palm, which was another reason Naruto approved the development of this advanced weaponry. While Boruto still insisted they should rely solely on ninjutsu like in the Chūnin Exams, Naruto noted that the Chūnin Exams were to test one's growth as a ninja, where as they are now in a battle for survival. Katasuke then arrived to retrieve his prototype, to which Naruto assigned Team Konohamaru a C-rank mission to escort the lead scientist back to the lab in Ryūben City. While Boruto stormed off in a huff, Naruto asked his genin team-mates to watch over him should anything happen with his mark. As Konohamaru failed to report from his mission, Naruto contacted Boruto's team at theScientific Ninja Weapons Team's lab, who were nearest to Konohamaru's last reported location. He instructed them to search the area but be careful and not recklessly engage any foes. While Shikamaru reminded him that Team Konohamaru were all very capable for their age, Naruto insisted that he was more concerned about the possibility of them running into the organisationKaraas Konohamaru's mission was to investigate a mysterious airship."
What was the name of the boy who was detained at the Advanced Technology Research Institutein Rytan City?,Kawaki,Kawaki arc,"Main article:Kawaki ArcWhen Team 7 returned with news of Mugino's demise at the hands ofAo, who was in leagues with Kara, they also revealed a boy with ties to Kara namedKawaki. In the anime, he was detained at theAdvanced Technology Research Institutein Ryūtan City, prompting Naruto and Sai to go immediately and meet the boy. On the train ride, Sai noted that it was risky to take such a mysterious boy back to the village. Naruto understood Sai's fear, knowing that Kara's desire of the boy could lead to the village becoming a battlefield again. Upon arriving in the station, they learned that Kawaki escaped and was on a rampage. Before Naruto and Sai could act, they met with Boruto and Sumire, the latter insisted to not hurt Kawaki. She noted that Kawaki's rampage stemmed from emotional scars due to his troubled past. Taking Sumire's words to heart, Naruto stopped Kawaki's passively, subduing him until he tired himself out and collapsed. Naruto comforts Kawaki. Naruto decided he was most suitable to monitor Kawaki, and held a Kage Summit to discuss the situation. Following the unanimous agreement from other Kage with Naruto, he took the boy to his house, during which he foiled Kawaki's attempts at fleeing. There, Kawaki attempting to escape, but Naruto intimidated him into submission. His escape attempt resulted in Himawari's vase being destroyed. Naruto intervened when Boruto and Kawaki began fighting, and later overheard Kawaki speaking of his hardship as a result of his Kāma. Afterwards, Naruto took Kawaki toYamanaka Flowersto pick a new vase, where he hugged Kawaki after he had a panic attack. Sometime later, Naruto and Boruto sparred; he defeated his son, even while Boruto used his Kāma. Naruto offered for Kawaki to try sparring with Boruto next time, but Kawaki declined as he couldn't use chakra, prompting Naruto to insist that all can learn to do so and that having strong rivals will help one in accomplishing great things. Later, Boruto decided to take Kawaki's offer of learning what he knows about their Kāma. Deciding to do so through sparring, the two children quickly activated their respective marks. While Boruto kept up in hand-to-hand combat, Kawaki's usage of his modified body put Boruto on the defensive. Kawaki then launched a blast at Naruto with the intent of him absorbing it like previously, only for Boruto to instead damage his hand. Naruto called off the match and told the two to perform the Seal of Reconciliation. The event made their marks react and caused Boruto's hand to instantly heal. Before pushing the subject, Naruto was alerted of an intruder. Naruto told his son to take Himawari away while he stayed with Kawaki, certain that the intruder was after Kawaki. His assumption proved correct as they were quickly met byDelta. She demanded Naruto hand over Kawaki to her, and Kawaki confirmed her identity as an Inner from Kara. Naruto instructed Boruto to protect Himawari and Kawaki to protect himself. Naruto fighting Delta. Fighting her, Naruto initially outperformed her with taijutsu, but she began making use of her shinobi-ware to launch sneak attacks and absorb his Rasengan. Naruto entered his Six Paths Sage Mode, but Delta was eventually able to stab him and pin him down. He tried to discern her motives for wanting Kawaki, but she saw through his deception, and noticed he was already healing, considering Naruto to be a monster as well. While Naruto was continually forced to hold back in fear of the spectators' safety, he continued to gradually wear down his foe, leading to Delta using her Destruction Beam against Naruto to combat his regenerative ability. Eventually, Delta targets Himawari, leading to Naruto blocking the attack with his body, but is uninjured as Kawaki sacrificed his right arm to block the attack. Enraged at her tactics, Naruto resumed the fight and quickly overwhelmed her. Naruto, having seen her return his Rasengan that she absorbed, deduces that there was a limit to how much chakra her eyes can absorb since the chakra or attack had to be stored somewhere in her body rather than dissipating and vanishing, prompting him to overpower and defeat Delta with hisSuper-Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan. Defeated, Delta's body self-destructed, forcing Naruto to flee the vicinity with the children. Naruto training Kawaki. Later, when bringing Kawaki to Katasuke to repair Kawaki's arm, the scientist informed him that the technology in Kawaki's body was too advanced for him to handle. Finding an alternate solution, Naruto gave Kawaki one of his prosthetic arms and channelled some of his chakra into Kawaki to make it work. Shocked at how sincere Naruto was at being nice, Kawaki asked to learn ninjutsu, which Naruto agreed to and began training him. Quite a while after Delta's defeat, while Naruto and Kawaki were at his house, he notices Kawaki in distress, resulting in his Kāma creating a portal which Jigen emerged from. Wanting to take his son back, Naruto attempted to attack him but was repelled away and impaled by chakra draining rods. Activating his chakra mode, Naruto kicks Jigen away from Kawaki. Jigen then proceeded to activate his Kāma. Fearing for the Hokage's safety, with Jigen's power entirely above Delta's and capable of either killing or severely injuring Naruto, Kawaki stepped in and submitted, agreeing to back willingly with Jigen if he spared Naruto. While Jigen agreed to the terms, Naruto refused to comply. Jigen responded by teleporting himself and Naruto to another dimension. Naruto and Sasuke facing Jigen. As Jigen attempted to strand Naruto there, he was attacked and stopped by Sasuke. Being away from Konoha and free to fight with all their power, the pair engaged in battle with Jigen, leading to Sasuke deducing their opponent's fighting style involved shrinking himself and his rods. Pressuring Jigen, the Kara member taped into his Kāma and grew a horn. Upon seeing Jigen's development, Sasuke revealed how he resembled anunknownŌtsutsuki member, and that Jigen had ties with a juvenile Ten-Tails. As Sasuke also revealed that Jigen's goal was to drain the entire planet of all its chakra, the two shinobi decided to fight with their full power. Despite their strong avatar forms and team-work, Jigen ploughed through their defences. As he swiftly wore down and pummelled his foes, he restrained the pair with rods and decided to keep Naruto alive because of Kurama in him while killing Sasuke due to his Rinnegan's Space-Time Ninjutsu. Accepting the truth, Naruto had his clones hold off Jigen while he convinced Sasuke to escape despite his friend's protests. Jigen revealed that he was after Boruto Uzumaki for his Kāma and sealed Naruto in a giant pot which he shrunk, leaving Naruto trapped within the foreign dimension. Afterwards,Borostood guard over the pot, during which Boruto and Kawaki used their Kama totransportNaruto's unconscious body out before killing the Kara member. Returning to Konoha, they were all taken to the hospital for treatment. As Naruto made a quick recovery, he was impressed to hear of the genin's work, and joked that rebellious genin seemed to still be a thing. In the anime, they discussed the recent events. Kawaki informed them that each member of Kara was modified with Shinobi-Ware, granting them abilities besides ninjutsu. After everyone else left, Shikamaru discussed with Naruto on how best to deal with Kawaki, as his Kāma acted as a direct path to Konoha at any time for Kara. Upon learning of Boro's cult, Naruto assigned Sai and Konohamaru to investigate, hoping to discover new information on the new whereabouts of Kara's Ten-Tails. They returned and reported Boro's scheme for getting new cultists and using them as subjects for Kara's Vessel experiments, as well as that despite her defeat to Naruto, Delta was somehow still active, having destroyed the cult's base. Naruto interrogates Amado. Later, Naruto was informed by Ino of Shikadai being taken hostage byAmado. Though he wished to speak to Shikamaru, he was glad to learn of Naruto's rescue, and revealed he wished to defect to Konoha, offering intel on Kara, Jigen, their Ten-Tails, and the Ōtsutsuki. After Naruto gave his word as Hokage to not go back on the deal provided his intel was good, Amado began explaining all he knew. He revealed that how the Ōtsutsuki have since before recorded history been travelling from planet to planet, harvesting its chakra for the sake of evolving itself while destroying the planet in the process, using the Ten-Tails for the process. He revealed that Jigen himself was turned into an Ōtsutsuki from being branded by his Kāma of Isshiki. Amado also revealed to have sabotaged the blimp to free Kawaki and likewise ensure that Sasuke would get the intel of Isshiki. Amado's glasses began beeping. His glasses were taken off, revealing a holographic projection of Jigen talking with his accompliceKoji Kashinintended to kill Jigen. As Naruto was intrigued by Koji's techniques and battle tactics, Amado insisted that Naruto accept his request to officially join Konohagakure with full amnesty and protection in order to hear more of his secrets, which Naruto agreed. Amado carried on his explanation, sharing what he knew of Jigen, the Ōtsutsuki, and Kāma. He stressed how a full rebirth of the Ōtsutsuki must be avoided, and claimed he'd teach them how to kill an Ōtsutsuki. When Jigen's death triggered Isshiki's resurrection in his body, Amado explained this also erased Kawaki's Kāma to avoid duplicates, leading Shikamaru to realise that without any remaining Kāma, Isshiki was vulnerable to a permanent death. Naruto halts Isshiki's search. After Amado was officially made a citizen of Konohagakure, made aware of his rights and limitations, he warned them of Isshiki's immediate focus on rebranding Kawaki. He advised Naruto against taking the fight to Isshiki, and stressed that had to protect Kawaki against being rebranded. Naruto took his advice and ordered a civilian evacuation, as Isshiki would seek Kawaki in Konoha. Naruto was against Boruto staying to fight him, but where interrupted by an alert of Isshiki's arrival. Naruto ordered Boruto to join the evacuation as he went to confront Isshiki. Isshiki was surprised to see Naruto had escaped, but demanded for Kawaki. When Naruto refused, Isshiki began shrinking various targets in the village to destroy it. Naruto activated hisSix Paths Sage Mode, but Isshiki easily overpowered him. Sasuke soon joined the fight, levelling the battlefield. He then launched his sword at Isshiki. As Isshiki attempted to shrink it, it was revealed to Borutotransformed. As Naruto was horrified by his son's arrival, Boruto activated hisKāma, teleporting himself and Isshiki to another dimension. Naruto and Sasuke followed through the latter's Rinnegan. As the Konoha-nin faced down Isshiki, he decided the best way to get Kawaki was to present Sasuke and Naruto's corpses to the village. The fight quickly resumed, with Naruto and Sasuke's team-work managing to push Isshiki on the defence as he began shrinking all their attacks. Quickly however, Isshiki demonstrated a new technique, manifesting and manipulatingmassive black cubesthat separated the duo. Naruto overwhelming Isshiki. Realising he was running out of options, Kurama asked Naruto if he was really willing to sacrifice himself to stop Isshiki. Naruto confirmed it, and Kurama offered a last-ditch strategy which would have a high risk of death from using it. Accepting his duties as Hokage, Naruto faced Isshiki and took on a new form ofBaryon Mode. Kurama explained to Naruto that the form is like nuclear fusion, consuming all their respective energy and that he must be careful not to make any unnecessary movements or thoughts. The new form baffled everyone with its sheer power. Naruto quickly began overwhelming Isshiki, constantly countering and dodging the foes various assaults. Soon after, the strain of Baryon Mode began catching up as Naruto began to tire. Kurama noted this form gradually drains away all life-forces, including Naruto's. However, it would also drain Isshiki's with each contact, meaning they just had to keep pressuring Isshiki until his already diminished lifespan ran out. As Isshiki began getting desperate, he took advantage of Naruto's chakra connection to Kawaki through the latter's prosthetic arm. From this, he teleported Kawaki to them with the goal of rebranding Kawaki before his time ran out. As Kawaki tried to escape Isshiki, he opted to use Kawaki's love for Naruto against him, assaulting the downed Hokage. Despite Naruto's insistence that Kawaki forget about him, Kawaki ultimately showed himself and attacked using the ninjutsu Naruto taught him. Isshiki easily negated it and branded Kawaki again, only for it to be revealed as a shadow clone. Naruto watches Kurama's life fade away. Finally, Isshiki's time ran out and he crumbled to dust. Sasuke then asked Naruto about his new power, but before he could answer, Boruto, being controlled byMomoshiki, suddenly stabbed Sasuke's left eye. Naruto attempted to help fighting Momoshiki, but collapsed, feeling heavy as lead, and passed out. Inside his subconscious, Naruto had a final conversation with Kurama. He told the kitsune that he had no ill will to Kurama despite the loss of his parents. As Naruto was prepared to die and voiced his concerns for the village, Kurama revealed that Naruto would awake soon and fine, as it was Kurama's life that was gambled from using Baryon Mode. Kurama assured Naruto that it never actually lied to Naruto, but knew the Hokage wouldn't risk Kurama's own life so he hid the truth. As Kurama's life began to fade, it warned Naruto that he would lose all access to Kurama's chakra and abilities, meaning he would have to be more careful from now on. Naruto desperately reached out for Kurama before waking up to see Boruto, Sasuke, and Kawaki standing over him. Naruto comforts Boruto over his Kāma. With Sasuke's Rinnegan and Kawaki's Kāma gone, it was up to Boruto to use his mark to bring everyone back with aid from Kawaki. Upon returning to the village, Naruto was relieved. In the anime, shortly after returning, Naruto was examined by Sakura and Katasuke for any remaining traces of Kurama's essence and capacities. The tests found nothing, confirming that Kurama's death would considerably drop Naruto's abilities and fighting potential. Naruto admitted that Kurama's power had felt like cheating, and despite the void left behind, he chose not to wallow on it, believing that Kurama would make fun of him over it. Afterwards, Naruto received confirmation that Boruto's Kāma was accelerating, and decided to inform Boruto himself. He vowed to do everything in his power to save Boruto. When Kawaki returned his prosthetic hand, having his natural one restored by Amado, Naruto offered to make him a genin."

As Naruto decided to test Kawaki for qualification as a shinobi, Shikamaru voiced his concerns, feeling that his modified body would be a prime target for enemies to go after. Naruto however insisted that for Kawaki to grow, he needed to experience the outside world and make friends who could protect him. Because Kawaki fared poorly in D-rank missions with different teams, lacking team-work, Shikamaru deemed him unfit for being a shinobi. He and Naruto agreed to assign him a C-rank escort mission with Team 10 as a final chance to qualify as a genin. Konohamaru arrived and handed him intel on a recently discovered dead body. They wondered about a connection with five other similar incidents in other countries. They determined there was a connection, as all of them were from the Land of Calm Seas.

As Naruto left two shadow clones on standby to store up more senjutsu chakra, Shikamaru arrived, refusing to let Naruto leave the village against the threat without him since the Hokage now no longer had Kurama for additional power. Shikamaru reminded Naruto that he cannot maintain Sage Mode for long anymore, but Naruto insisted that he can maintain it longer on his own drawing from years of experience. They arrive in time to save Kawaki from having his arm broken by Momoshiki, who had taken over Boruto again. Naruto checked on Kawaki, who begged him to flee, fearing his death. Naruto refused to abandon anyone. Code took Shikamaru hostage, who in turn told Naruto to ignore him and attack. Momoshiki decided to help Code killing Naruto, who was also a problem for him, and attacked with anUltra-Big Ball Rasengan. He was surprised to see Kawaki absorbing the jutsu with a new Kāma. Naruto continued to watch in disbelief as Kawaki began attacking Momoshiki with no restraint, displaying Isshiki's jutsu in the process. Eventually, Naruto intervened, as Kawaki's attacked would have killed Boruto. He tried to reason with Kawaki, who remained committed to killing Momoshiki. Boruto managed to hold back Momoshiki's personality for a moment, and pushed Naruto out of the way, allowing Kawaki to strike through his chest. Code opted to leave and released Shikamaru. While Kawaki was overwhelming Code, he pulled Daemon through the Claw Mark of his face, reflecting Kawaki's attack and knocking him out before leaving. Shikamaru tried to snap Naruto out of his stupor, and began to consider how to deal with Kawaki, arguing with Naruto, who still wanted to support Kawaki. He was stunned when Boruto woke up, his injuries completely healed."
Who did Naruto have a long talk with when he wakes up?,Kawaki,Omnipotence arc,"Main article:Omnipotence ArcAfter everyone returned to the village, Naruto kept watch over Kawaki as Shikamaru had Sumire examine him. They and Ibiki discussed how to handle Kawaki, and Naruto intended to have a long talk with Kawaki when he wakes up. Sumire noticed the heavy atmosphere around Naruto and asked Shikamaru about it. He claimed Naruto was just exhausted from almost being killed. When Kawaki woke up, he asked Naruto if he'd condemn him for killing Boruto. Naruto revealed Boruto was fine because of his Kāma. He added was grateful that Kawaki was there, otherwise they might all have died, and that Boruto felt the same. As Naruto reassured him that he belonged in Konoha and was family, Ino alerted him of Code andAda's invasion. Naruto feigned a previous appointment and left after confirming that Boruto was fine to a startled Sumire. After Code and Ada left taking Amado with them, Naruto listened as Shikamaru explained Ada's alluring ability and speculated on the other cyborg that Code employed in his battle the previous night. When Kawaki acted callous when considering Amado's possible death and deriding Shikamaru, Naruto censored him. As Shikamaru briefed Team 7 on their new surveillance mission living with Ada and Daemon, Naruto discussed it with Sasuke, explaining how Shikamaru managed to covertly control Boruto and Kawaki into acting more cautiously by entrusting them with responsibility in the form of a mission. When Naruto noticed Sasuke noticing something, Sasuke dismissed it. After Ada and Daemon departed for their new home, Naruto joined Shikamaru in getting Amado to share everything he was still keeping secret. He listened as Amado explained theshinjutsunature of Ada's and Daemon's abilities, their origins inShibai Ōtsutsuki's remains, and Amado's goal of using Kawaki's Kāma to resurrect his daughterAkebi. When Shikamaru asked Ada to confirm Amado's claims with herSenrigan, Naruto found it a bit excessive. He was satisfied with Amado's goal, and decided he wouldn't interfere in his matters with Kawaki if it didn't endanger Konoha. Naruto agreed to Ada's request to call it a day, as they had just arrived in the village. While preparing for dinner with Hinata, they were joined by Kawaki, who asked Naruto not to inform the sensors of his presence. Naruto listened as Kawaki reiterated how much he changed because of Naruto, and how he came to think that shinobi and good people like Naruto would be the first to die in any conflict with Ōtsutsuki. When Kawaki said he'd eliminate all the Ōtsutsuki to protect Naruto, including Boruto, Naruto refused to let Kawaki do this. Not wanting to hurt Naruto, nor let him get in the way, Kawaki sent Naruto and Hinata away withDaikokuten, where they'd be suspended in time, unable to think, and requiring no air or sustenance."

(iv) The first version of Naruto that Masashi Kishimoto drew.,(iii),Creation and conception,"When creating Naruto,Masashi Kishimotoincorporated into the character a number of traits he felt made an ideal hero: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and many of the attributes possessed bySon Gokūfrom theDragon Ballfranchise. He also made sure to keep Naruto ""simple and stupid,"" since he does not like smart characters. Naruto himself is not modeled after anyone in particular, being conceived as childlike, with something of a dark side as a result of his harsh past. Despite this, he is always positive, making him unique in Kishimoto's eyes. The first version of Naruto that Masashi Kishimoto drew. Naruto's wardrobe is based on clothing Kishimoto wore when he was younger; according to Kishimoto, using a pre-existing design would not have made Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him stand out too much. The orange colouring of his costume is used to make Naruto ""pop,"" with blues often being used to complement the orange. Because Naruto is associated with spirals, swirl patterns are incorporated into his costume. Initial illustrations of Naruto had him wearing boots, but Kishimoto substituted these for sandals, because he likes drawing toes. The goggles that Naruto used to wear were also replaced with a forehead protector, because the goggles themselves were too time-consuming to draw. Kishimoto said that he felt glad that his character had blond hair and blue eyes. The editor ofShōnen Jumpin the United States added that Kishimoto implied that the traits may have led the character to appeal to a Western audience. Kishimoto said that he most identifies with Naruto out of all of theNarutocharacters . Naruto's appearances throughout the series. In the Japanese versions ofNaruto, Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum ""-ttebayo"" . Kishimoto wanted to give Naruto a childlike catchphrase, and ""dattebayo"" came to mind. It complemented Naruto's character, and served as a verbal tic that showed him to be something of a brat. Throughout the beginning of the Englishanime, the dub replaced ""dattebayo"" and ""-ttebayo"" with the phrase ""believe it!"" to mirror the effect, as well as to match the character's lip movements."
Who is Sasuke's best friend?,Naruto Uzumaki,Introduction,"Sasuke Uchiha is one of the last surviving members ofKonohagakure'sUchiha clanand areincarnationofIndra Ōtsutsuki. After his older brother,Itachi,slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added toTeam 7upon becoming aShinobi, and, through competition with his rival and best friend,Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills but eventually grows dissatisfied with his progress. He defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge and master theCursed Seal of Heaven. His years of seeking vengeance and the actions that followed became increasingly demanding, irrational, and isolated from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending theFourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the ""Supporting Kage"" ."
What was Sasuke's only goal in life?,avenging their family by killing Itachi,Personality,"Sasuke's pleasant disposition as a child. Sasuke was a happy child, eager to please and be worthy of his clan name.[15]One of Sasuke's most significant bonds is the one he has with his older brother, Itachi, who by merely being mentioned can elicit strong reactions from Sasuke's otherwise calm demeanour. Sasuke adored Itachi when he was a boy, enjoying his company above all others'; as an infant, he would cry whenever he was held by someone besides Itachi and would immediately be happy once held by his big brother again.[16]When Itachi murdered the rest of the Uchiha clan, Sasuke was crushed not only by the loss of his family but also by what Itachi told him: that he had never loved Sasuke. Sasuke devotes years of his life to avenging their family by killing Itachi, which Itachi encourages whenever they meet. At the same time however, he became determined to do so through his own means, including rejecting Itachi's instructions of obtaining theMangekyō Sharinganfor power, simply to not give Itachi the satisfaction. With his new outlook, he became cold toward others, unmoved by and uninterested in what they do or think of him, choosing instead to keep to himself. He stopped usinghonourifics, something considered rude in the Japanese language. His only goal in life became to take revenge for his clan's deaths by any means, even if it meant acquiring power that wasn't his own.[17][18] In his pursuit for the power to take his revenge, whenever he meets new people, he makes an evaluation of their abilities: those he perceives to be weaker than himself he arrogantly disregards, giving them little attention so that they won't hold him back; those he perceives as stronger he fixates over and tries to surpass. As a member ofTeam 7he is repeatedly exposed toKakashi Hatake's philosophy that there is strength in teamwork. For a time, Sasuke accepts this, experiencing it first-hand on several of Team 7's missions. He even become attached to his teammates and started to forget the vengeance he craved, achieving after so many years a measure of happiness. However, between both the manipulations ofOrochimaruand meeting Itachi again in Part I, where he was and is utterly defeated, Sasuke decides to sever all ties to his village in a single-minded pursuit of power, leaving Konoha to focus solely on himself. Kakashi tried to help Sasuke realise the contradiction in his viewpoint: he is driven to gain power because he lost his family, yet sacrifices the family he still has in order to gain that power, which did have a profound impact on Sasuke and would have turned him away from the path of darkness had he not been influenced by the Sound Four. Sasuke succumbs to his clan's Curse of Hatred. So focused on vengeance, he willingly accepted Orochimaru's offer of power, seeking out the Sannin to train Sasuke in all he knew, even allowing Orochimaru to experiment on him despite knowing the man was using him for his own gain. Ultimately however, Sasuke decided that letting himself be used by Orochimaru would be a disgrace to his clan, turning on Orochimaru and acquires newteam-mateswith abilities that could further his goals. Following his training under Orochimaru, Sasuke developed a very composed and detached demeanour, similar to Itachi, never letting himself get worked up in battle. Likewise, Sasuke initially retained his morals by setting a firm no-kill policy for himself and his team against those unrelated to his revenge and openly expressing disgust at Orochimaru for his horrific experiments. In addition, despite becoming cold towards his old team, Sasuke did become attached to his new teammates, still subconsciously holding a notion of teamwork, comparing them to the bond he had with Team 7 and pushing himself to extremes to save them. After Itachi dies in battle with Sasuke and he learned that the hateful older brother that Itachi seemed to be was all an act and that, in truth, Sasuke was the most precious person to Itachi; his murder of the Uchiha was done on the instructions ofKonoha, in order to protect Sasuke. Sasuke becomes overwhelmed by this discovery and starts conspiring against Konoha and all its citizens for ruining his and Itachi's lives, knowing full well it isn't what Itachi would want him to do. As time passed after this and hishatredincreased, Sasuke's fall to darkness steadily eroded much of the goodness he once had: he would without hesitation challenge and even slaughter any and all who stood in his way, leftJūgoandSuigetsuwithout caring for their fates, essentially sacrificedKarinto strike downDanzō Shimura, and even tried to kill Team 7 when they impede or attempt to dissuade him from his objectives.[19]He also allies withTobiandAkatsukiwhen their goals align, but left them without comment when he no longer needs them. His abandonment of all his former loyalties and his criminal acts convince hisformer classmatesthat Sasuke is beyond salvation. Tobi determined that Sasuke was carrying the entirety of theUchiha's hatred on his shoulders, and this caused Sasuke to gain an unwavering and twisted pride of his clan, deeming anyone who possessed his clan's abilities without being one of them or even someone who just isn't an Uchiha as inferior shinobi trash and impostors, and became increasingly irate and unstable when witnessing it. Ultimately, Sasuke came to believe that Konoha's destruction will free the Uchiha from being associated with the rotten shinobi world and the resulting purity will restore the clan. He also became very reckless, as he used hisMangekyō Sharinganconstantly, causing his eyesight to deteriorate drastically within a matter of hours. Sasuke's unhinged state. After his final encounter withreincarnatedItachi, between learning of Itachi's struggles in life and knowing that Itachi made the choice willingly to become the villain for the sake of peace, Sasuke is left uncertain about what course to take. From long contemplation, Sasuke came to a warped view of helping the world to ensure no further conflict between them: if a single individual, what Sasuke calls the ""TrueHokage"", is solely responsible for making the difficult decisions, killing and the like for the greater good, then everybody will be unified in their hatred of that individual. He volunteers himself for that responsibility and planned to eliminate what few friendships he still has to ensure no turning back. But Naruto, by refusing to give up on saving Sasuke from darkness, demonstrates that their friendship is too fundamental to who Sasuke is and that it cannot nor should not be broken. On coming to terms with this, Sasuke stops fighting the many bonds he's made and chooses to die so the Curse of Hatred would die along with him. However, after further convincing from Naruto, Sasuke chose to live to find redemption instead. Afterwards, Naruto returned Sasuke's forehead protector, which Sasuke keeps on him during his long travels as a symbol of their friendship. Even though he no longer wears it, he carries it with him regularly, truly valuing it and only letting people he truly trusts hold on to it. Sasuke is freed from the Curse of Hatred. After theFourth Shinobi World War, Sasuke began adopting some of Itachi's views: he decides to fight for Konoha's future so that Itachi's actions aren't made meaningless and bases his understanding of the ""Hokage"" around the decisions Itachi made. He also starts poking the foreheads of those dearest to him as a sign of affection, something Itachi used to always do with him. While still not very open with his emotions, Sasuke became more committed to make connections with people. This included his former teammateSakura Haruno. While originally their relationship was mindless infatuation from Sakura for his good looks and indifference if not blunt irritation from him, over time the two came to better understand one another and true respect was formed between them. Though while he cared for her as a comrade, he did not reciprocate her feelings. After he admitted to being defeated by Naruto and let go of his hatred, Sasuke sincerely apologises to Sakura for how much he hurt her - to which, she tearfully forgives him, allowing them to reconcile. They later maintain a long-distance relationship while he pursues a journey of redemption. The two of them later marry and have a daughter,Sarada.[20]While not very affectionate with his family, he is indeed happy about having them and cherishes it, voicing it to others,[21]and feels a strong connection to them when they are apart. Likewise, he enjoys teasing his wife by declining affection, but is strongly against letting other men flirt with her.[22]Sasuke's emotional distance seems to from being so committed to his long-stretching missions. At the same time, he regrets not having been a more attentive man to his family, especially for his daughter, having missed out on much of her childhood and by extension not knowing much about her, showing a noticeably unsure side when trying to be close with Sarada. Still, Sasuke loves his daughter dearly and will go to great lengths to protect Sarada and puts her feelings ahead of his own, as despite having his own memoriestampered withwithout his knowledge, witnessing Sarada's awakening of her Mangekyō Sharingan was enough to make Sasuke change his mind and help Boruto after she pleaded him to despite Boruto being seemingly Konoha's enemy. During his time as a wanderer, Sasuke was a recluse, keeping contact with people to an absolute minimum and maintained his strong sense of pride; he is willing to help the villages if their problems are beyond their expertise but ignores their requests if facing insignificant issues. Stemming from his inspiration of Itachi protecting the Land of Fire from the shadows, he also sometimes acts independently on his own and helps the five nations, but does not even bother to interact with anyone during such instances if not needed. At the same time, he is willing to acknowledging significant events as he sent a note congratulating Naruto for his wedding. Acknowledging his mistakes and once free from hate and vengeance, Sasuke reverts back to the type of person he was prior to the massacre; being kind to others and displaying a sense of humour but maintaining his aloof exterior. Although publicly regarded as a hero for his role in the war, Sasuke feels that his crimes and imperfections outweigh anything heroic he has ever done. Ashamed of his past actions, Sasuke referred to the person he used to be as an entirely different person when he told Boruto about his past actions, albeit without directly telling Boruto he was referring to himself. Sasuke showcasing his paternal instincts. As an adult, Sasuke becomes wiser and mature, as well as genuinely warmer and caring, though his tendency to appear deadpan remains. He does retain his habit of insulting others, although it is usually more comical than cold, and mostly aimed towards Naruto. He has also shown a degree of humility, openly admitting to his failings, particularly as a family man. Although he fulfills Itachi's wish for him to protect Konoha, doing this from the shadows and investigating the mysteries of Kaguya leave him unable to spend time with his family, to the point of even failing to recognise his daughter, Sarada. Regardless, he is protective of Sarada and is very supportive of her goal to become Hokage and not end up like him. Even more, Sasuke loves his family dearly as he tries to spend time with them when he is able to come home, and expresses pride in his daughter's growth and achievements. AsBoruto's teacher, Sasuke is devoted to his apprentice's well-being and progress. Despite seeing Boruto's usage of acheating deviceto pass the preliminary test he gave the boy, Sasuke agreed to take him as a student, as he saw it as similar to his own past of willingness to do anything to attain power. He later reprimanded Boruto for using the device during theChūnin Exams, but still saw his true power and lent him his forehead protector as a sign of trust and faith. Taking his role as a mentor seriously, Sasuke is willing to let Boruto participate in dangerous battles against the Ōtsutsuki as he saw the boy is living up to his potential that may turn the tide of the fights, even when Naruto decided otherwise. Because of this, Sasuke made it clear he is prepared to kill Boruto shouldMomoshikitake over him via theKāma, per his duty as Boruto's teacher. Despite atoning for much of his mistakes, he still feels much guilt for them, openly feeling that for all his fame as a ninja, he is not someone to admire or be emulated. At the same time, Sasuke retains some of the ruthlessness he had during his criminal days; Sasuke was initially hellbent on eliminating theclones of Shin Uchihadespite their visible fear and hesitation towards the end of their battle, and was only convinced of sparing them by Naruto, and when the notorious criminalShojojiremained arrogant and fearless when interrogated bySai YamanakaandIbiki Morino, Sasuke's sudden arrival and presence were enough to intimidate Shojoji into revealing details aboutKara, with Sasuke mentioning that despite changing his ways, he'd still retained his reputation of being unmerciful and brutal towards criminals. Even so, Sasuke is also very balanced and adaptable. When Sasuke took a mission to theLand of Redakuas a disguised prisoner in order to locate thePolar particlesneeded to heal Naruto of his illness that would eventually strip the latter of his ability to use chakra, Sasuke kept a low profile by pretending to be weak. He even allowed the abusive prison guards to beat him as his top priority was finding the cure Naruto needed."
What color is Sasuke's shirt?,navy blue,Appearance,"According toHashirama Senju, Sasuke bears a strong resemblance toIzuna Uchiha:[23]he has black eyes and spiky black hair. Sasuke's hair is long with bangs since childhood, which as he gets older he allows to grow longer and, in turn, cover more of his face. After acquiring his Rinnegan, Sasuke grew his hair to cover the left side of his face, notably the eye. He is considered very handsome by most girls. Sasuke's typical clothing has changed a number of times throughout his life, but theUchiha clan's crest is usually present somewhere on his clothing, such as the back of his shirt collar. For most of Part I, he wears a navy blue, short-sleeved shirt with a high collar, white shorts, and, for a time, white arm warmers. During the Chūnin Exams' finals, he wears a black, one-piece version of this usual attire with many small belts adorning his left arm and similar bands around both legs. He wears a blue-clothedforehead protectorwith both of these outfits, but starts wearing it less and less after being hospitalised by Itachi, finally abandoning it entirely at the end of Part I. In Part II, Sasuke consistently wears dark blue pants, over which hangs a blue cloth that covers him from his stomach to his knees, which he secures with a purple rope belt; as is common toOrochimaruand his followers. He initially complements this with a white long-sleeved shirt kept open at the torso and black arm guards that cover his forearms. Leading up to and during his battle with Itachi, he replaces this top with a sleeveless dark grey shirt and the arm guards with bandages on his wrists. He switches after Itachi's death, wearing a white zippered, high-collared, short-sleeved shirt and blue wrist warmers. He wears a hooded cloak over his clothing at different points, usually, an unadorned black one during his pursuit of Itachi alongsideHebi, and for a brief time, sported the trademarkAkatsukicloak, only with a hood instead of the regular high collar. Sasuke loses his left arm at the end of theFourth Shinobi World War, though unlike Naruto, he opts not to have it replaced with a prosthetic arm made ofHashirama Senju's cells. InThe Last: Naruto the Movie, he wears a black high-collared shirt, a midriff-exposingflak jacket, and light grey pants. Most of this goes unseen, as he wears a tattered light brown poncho over it. He wraps bandages around his ankles and a blue sash around his head during this appearance. InSasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise, he wears a black cloak over a black shirt and pants with a white belt and white bandages wrapped up to his knees on both legs. In his later adulthood, Sasuke dons a black cloak with purple lining, and a grey, long-sleeved, collared shirt, over which he wears a periwinkle vest. He also wears black pants, a purple belt, a and dark grey fingerless glove on his remaining hand. He once again wears his forehead protector, letting it hang from his left hip.[24]Sasuke also grows significantly taller by adulthood, becoming slightly taller than Naruto, who is one of the tallest amongst his graduate class. At the beginning ofBoruto: Naruto Next Generations, the colour scheme of Sasuke's outfit is revised, having his black cloak gain a storm flap, a maroon cinch on the collar, and maroon lining. His long-sleeved shirt gains light grey cuffs, and he wears a pair of brown leather belts with a black sheath for his sword, a brown shuriken holster, and brown shinobi boots. Whilst inthe past, Sasuke wears a long trench coat over his outfit, and a fedora hat to hide his identity, and when not wearing his fedora, Sasuke sports an eyepatch over his left eye to hide his Rinnegan."
What is the name of Sasuke's brother?,Itachi,Abilities,"Sasuke executing his strongest technique, Indra's Arrow. Sasuke is recognised as a natural prodigy of theUchiha clan, graduating at the top of his class in theAcademy.[25]He made a strong impression onKakashi Hatakein thebell test, and could fight on par with strong shinobi, such asHakuandGaarain Part I. After Orochimaru's tutelage for three years, Sasuke becomes strong enough to fight and even pressure his brother,Itachi, as well as theFourth Raikage. Then after acquiringSix Paths Chakraand theRinnegan, he is compared to theSage of Six PathsbyKurama, and was able to help fight againstMadaraas theTen-Tails' jinchūriki. With Madara himself admitting that he would have chosen Sasuke over Obito as an apprentice if he was born years earlier.[26] In his adulthood, his performance has shown no impediment despite losing his left arm, as he fought on par withKinshiki Ōtsutsuki. Ultimately, he is regarded as a legendary shinobi,[27]with power equal to Naruto,[28]who is recognised as the strongest shinobi in history. The pair's combined strength is thought to be able to destroy the world.[29]Likewise, together they could overpower anempowered-Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, something the other fourKagecombined struggled to achieve, and even pushedJigen's body to its limit. Despite losing his Rinnegan, he remained a threat to Momoshiki,[30]and could slashCode's left eye.[31]"
What does Sasuke use to summon hawks?,hawks,Ninjutsu,"Sasuke learns tosummonsnakesduring his time with Orochimaru. He typically summons them as shields, rapid ground transportation, or tobindtargets. Unseen outside of theAnimal Path, Sasuke can also summon a second animal species:hawks. His use of hawks is more limited than snakes, using them only for flight and the additional manoeuvrability that allows. By adulthood, Sasuke can use theShadow Clone Technique, able to easily produce eight clones at once. While not amedical-ninhe has capable skill in theMystical Palm Technique, able to treat deep wounds and poisoning simultaneously.[54] As an Uchiha, Sasuke is trained in a variety of different ninja tools. As a child, he once used a bow and arrow to hunt a boar with Itachi,[55]practice that later becomes useful for hisSusanoo. His area of expertise isshurikenjutsu, allowing him to throwshurikenandkunaiwith precision; for complicated or moving targets, Sasuke can guide shuriken to their mark using eitherwire stringsor deflecting them off each other. In addition to remarkable natural speed and coordination for rapid usage, he also employs theLightning Flash Blade Creationfor even faster performance: by sealing shuriken, kunai, and wire strings into his arm bracelets, Sasuke has a large supply ready, allowing him to barrage targets in an instant. Sasuke wielding his sword. Sasuke begins using a sword after training with Orochimaru, eventually developing and mastering hisUchiha Style Kenjutsu. He wields it just as skillfully in either hand and compete against more experienced swordsmen,[56]quicklyresheathing itafter striking.[57][58]He can cut down multiple opponents in short periods of time.[59]He uses it defensively as well, blocking incoming projectiles;[60]By adulthood, Sasuke can instantly switch between wielding his sword backhanded and normally even during a clash,[18]was later able to slashCode's left eye, despite his power limiters being removed. Sasuke simultaneously using Lightning and Blaze Release. As an Uchiha, he has a strong aptitude forFire Release, mastering the clan'sGreat Fireball Techniqueyears before becoming agenin, a feat which greatly shocked Kakashi. Sasuke can alsocoat firearound his shuriken,guide his flamesalong with wire strings, or create a succession ofdragon-shaped fireballs. His Fire Release-prowess is shown to be strong enough to easily disperse most Water Release techniques,[61]and by channelling chakra through materials, could rapidly increase their temperature - enough to instantly melt glass.[62] Sasuke has a natural affinity toLightning Release, making first use of it with theChidoritaught by Kakashi. While effective at piercing most targets, it is a close-range attack. For this reason, Sasuke uses the principles of Chidori to create several long-range jutsu in Part II, such asthrowable needles,extendable swords, andscattershot streams. He often channels his lightning chakra into hisswordand shuriken[63]to increase their cutting power. Under the right weather conditions, he can control and manipulate natural lightning to launchpowerful strikesat speeds that are difficult to avoid. When using his cursed seal or theSix Paths Chakra, his lightning chakra becomes darker in colour, though it's not clear if this changes its actual properties in any way. By adulthood, Sasuke is capable of using his Lightning Release to further augment his speed during the battle, to the point it matchesKinshiki's speed.[18] After acquiring theRinnegan, Sasuke gains access to all five basicnature transformations, as well asYin Release.[4]With improved prowess inEarth Release, he can convert soil and stone intogems,glass, and other metals.[64]By adulthood, Sasuke shows significant prowess withWater Release, able to quicklygeneratemassive quantities of water in his hand or summoning it from a distance. He noted that his Water Release containsno impuritiesand does not conduct, but insulates electricity.[65]UsingWind Release, Sasuke is able to alter and decrease the surroundingair resistanceallowing him to quickly reach his destination.[66]From his fight withHaku, Sasuke was inspired to copy the latter'sIce Releasetechniques, learning to manipulate the state of water. He can evaporate it to create steam or useWind Releaseto freeze it.[67]He can instantly freeze a target and create structures ranging from a kunai to a bridge across the ocean.[68]Like typical Ice Release users, the immediate weather conditions are also affected.[69]Despite this, he admits his inferiority to the true Ice Release.[67]"
What is the name of the sharingan that Sasuke awakened on the night of the Uchiha Clan Downfall?,Sasuke's Sharingan,Dōjutsu,"Sasuke's Sharingan. Sasuke first awakened hisSharinganon the night of theUchiha Clan Downfall, though he isn't able to do so again until several years later during his battle against Haku. Sasuke's Sharingan is especially potent, as Orochimaru noted that despite not being fully developed at the time, it was even stronger and greater in clarity than Itachi's.[70]Later, his prowess and skill with his fully matured dōjutsu earned him the nickname ""Sasuke of the Sharingan"" .[8]With the Sharingan, Sasuke can see the flow of chakra, accurately reproduce any movement he sees , track fast-moving objects, and predict opponents' movement to a degree. He can also useGenjutsu: Sharinganfor broad purposes such as distraction, interrogation, knocking targets out,[71]or placing them under his control.[72]He can use his Sharingan to relay information to others or enter their subconscious, which in the case ofjinchūrikiallows him to suppress theirtailed beasts.[34]His Sharingan can also enhance his combat power from channeling his strong emotions,[73]which has led to his chakra becoming more potent than it was in hiscursed seal’ssecond state.[74]His Sharingan was also shown to be able to wipe people's memory's within a specific time gap. Sasuke's Mangekyō Sharingan. Sasuke awakens hisMangekyō Sharinganafter Itachi's death, once he comes to terms with the fact that Itachi did love him and was the single most significant relationship he had. Its design gives the appearance of three intersecting ellipses. Despite greatly augmenting his dōjutsu powers and access to new, additional techniques, it came at the cost of quickly exhausting him as well as straining his health. After Sasuke's excessive and regular usage of his Mangekyō almost completely deteriorates his eyesight, Sasuke hadObitotransplant Itachi's eyes to gain the ""eternal"" Mangekyō, just before the start of the Fourth Shinobi World War. The transplanted eyes resemble a cross between Sasuke's and Itachi's Mangekyō while also a granting Sasuke tremendously improved performance: His chakra drain is reduced considerably while causing no strain to his physical health or sight from extended usage. Likewise, his Eternal Mangekyō is a rare ""straight tomoe"" type, granting him fluidity in his movements when fighting.[75] Sasuke's Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan. With either Mangekyō,[76][77]Sasuke can useAmaterasu, igniting whatever he looks at with black flames that can burn anything. With his right Mangekyō, he can useKagutsuchitoshapethe flames into a variety of forms and purposes, such asspikesto impale people. This ability to manipulate his Amaterasu makes him more skilled than Itachi was with his own.[78]Having awakened the Mangekyō in both his eyes, Sasuke can useSusanoo, a spectral warrior that protects him and acts on his behalf. While its original development was drawn from moments of intense rage, Sasuke became able to produce various portions of the spectre to serve his needs, such as ribs for defence or arms to interact with his surroundings. At higher development, he can layer musculature and skin over the bones, and later armour to increase its power. Ultimately, after gainingSix Paths Chakra, he can produce significantly largerComplete Body — Susanoo, comparable in size and power to Naruto'sTailed Beast Mode. Sasuke's Complete Body — Susanoo. Like all Susanoo, Sasuke's has two swords at its disposal that it can use against larger targets or to easily destroy nearby structures. More commonly, his Susanoo employs a bow that can fire arrows at rapid speeds and, when needed, double as a shield. The arrows can be fashioned from the same chakra as Susanoo itself, Amaterasu's flames or,[79]channelling the tailed beasts' chakra, or lightning. From lightning, Sasuke can use his strongest attack,Indra's Arrow.[80]Susanoo can also be formed around theNine-Tailsin order to give it a sword and armour of its own,[81]and serve as a medium for his various techniques likeChidori.[82] Sasuke's Rinnegan. After receiving half ofHagoromo Ōtsutsuki's chakra as well as possibly being healed with Hashirama's cells, Sasuke awakened a Rinnegan in his left eye, with three tomoe on each of its two innermost circles.[83]However, should Sasuke's chakra reserves fall to a certain level, the tomoe vanish.[83]Unlike his lower dōjutsu, Sasuke's Rinnegan is apparently unable to revert to its original state. Despite this, it has no affect on his stamina or chakra levels. Likewise, Sasuke's Rinnegan can still access the techniques and abilities of his left Mangekyō. The dōjutsu gives Sasuke the ability of pattern recognition, being able to help him analyse patterns inside codes, and by comparing them to similar patterns, decipher writing.[84]It also grants him access to the various abilities of theSix Paths Techniques, such asforcibly attracting otherstowards him, trap individuals in theChibaku Tenseithrough theDeva Path, and absorb chakra through thePreta Path. He can also use it to seeinvisible targets, repel the effects of theInfinite Tsukuyomi,[85]and turn his Susanoo into a vessel for the tailed beasts' chakra, much like theDemonic Statue of the Outer Path.[86] His signature Rinnegan ability isSpace–Time Ninjutsu. With it, he can perceive distortions in the flow of time, see events that happen as normal, although it is unknown if he can negate the effects on himself.[87]WithAmenotejikara, he can instantly swap places of any two targets in a specific range. In adulthood, his Space–Time Ninjutsu became advanced enough totravelthrough dimensions, even with others through inter-dimensional portals;[88]UponBoruto Uzumakistabbing it while being controlled byMomoshiki Ōtsutsuki, Sasuke lost his Rinnegan and its abilities.[89]"
What does Sasuke equip himself with to compete with Itachi Uchiha's speed?,djutsu,Intelligence,"For Kirin, Sasuke conserves chakra by manipulating the environment rather than performing it by himself. Sasuke is very intelligent, having earned the best grades in hisAcademyclass.[90]This despite many of his classmates themselves being exceptional performers,[91]including Sakura who scored perfect scores in all her tests.[92]In combat, while usually offensive without pause, Sasuke is very observant, being mindful to all factors as he goes and analysing his opponents' techniques to understand their mechanics and purposes. He is accordingly accustomed to coming up with tactics on the fly, choosing whatever approach, no matter how elaborate, will be most successful at the exact moment. His strategies could be considered irresponsible or risky, as he has on more than one occasion placed himself or allies in harm's way. Despite this, his actions have the tendency to pay off, earning praise for his analytical skills fromMinato NamikazeandMadara Uchiha.[93]Jigenwould also praise Sasuke for having eventually figured out the nature of histechniqueand even went as far as to say that his analytical skills coupled with his dōjutsu made him more dangerous than Naruto, who was deemed his equal. Despite how he proceeds in the midst of combat, Sasuke does tend to be prepared before entering a fight, or as best as he can: he specifically trains to be faster thanGaara'ssand; he attacksOrochimaruat the moment when his body is weakest; he equips himself with theLightning Flash Blade Creationso that he can compete withItachi Uchiha's speed. He may even have a strategy in mind that he can work towards throughout a fight, as when he spends part of his fight with Itachi creating conditions forKirin, even relying on Itachi's own jutsu to facilitate in its use. He has shown tactical sense in teamwork, able to instantly understand an ally's battle plan with little communication and act accordingly to make it successful.[94]"

For their performance in the Land of Waves, however, Kakashi decides to enter them in theChūnin Examstaking place in Konoha. Because they've only recently graduated from the Academy, the three feel they must give strong showings to prove themselves. When they arrive at the exam hall, Sasuke first uses his Sharingan to dispel agenjutsuintended to discourage unqualified genin and then agrees to spar withRock Lee. Lee's speed andtaijutsuskills impress Sasuke enough to use his Sharingan in their fight. Although he is able to see Lee's movements better, Sasuke can't physically keep up and Lee nearly performs theFront Lotuson him. Lee is stopped by his teacher,Might Guy, whose emotional method of punishing Lee disturbs Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura. During the exam's first stage, the participating genin are given a written test. Sasuke is unable to answer any of the questions, causing him to realise that the purpose of the first stage is to cheat without getting caught. He, therefore, uses his Sharingan to mimic the pencil movements of other examinees. Team 7 continues to the second stage in theForest of Death, where to pass they must obtain a pair of scrolls, one of which they are given at the start, the other of which they must take from another team. At some point after entering Sasuke rescued alittle girlfrom a bear. He then notices the earth scroll in her hand and remarked on having a similar scroll. Soon after entering, Sasuke discovers that what appears to be Naruto is anAme-nin,Oboro, in disguise. He drives Oboro off and locates the real Naruto. To prevent this from happening again, Sasuke comes up with a complicated password that they'll share to confirm their identities in case they get separated. They are immediately attacked and, when they regroup, Naruto correctly recites the password. Knowing Naruto could never have remembered the password, Sasuke attacks the impostor. Sasuke branded with Orochimaru's cursed seal. The impostor,Orochimaru, is far too strong for them to contend with and may very well kill them. Sasuke tries to forfeit their scroll in exchange for their lives, but Naruto, upon locating them, stops him, believing Sasuke may also be an enemy ninja in disguise because the Sasuke he knows would never surrender. Naruto engages Orochimaru in combat, defeats hissnake, and calls Sasuke a scaredy-cat before Orochimaru finally renders him unconscious. Amazed by Naruto's performance and encouraged by Sakura, Sasuke picks up where he left off by pinning Orochimaru down and attacking him with theDragon Fire Technique. Orochimaru is impressed by Sasuke and brands him with aCursed Seal of Heavento reward him before leaving. The pain of the cursed seal overwhelms Sasuke and he passes out.

Sasuke questions Sakura on the identity of who hurt her, whichZaku Abumitakes credit for. Under the cursed seal's influence, Sasuke attacks Zaku and breaks both of his arms. He prepares to do the same to Zaku's teammates, but Sakura's pleas for him to stop bring him back to his senses and the cursed seal recedes. The genin teams go their separate ways and Team 7 spends several days recuperating from their ordeals. On the last day of the second stage, they go looking for the second scroll that they still need. They are found byTeam Oboro, who Naruto distracts while the rest of Team 7 sneaks up behind and knocks out. With two scrolls, Team 7 is able to advance to the preliminary round. Sasuke is paired againstYoroi Akadōfor the first match. Before the fight starts, Kakashi warns Sasuke that use of the cursed seal will disqualify him. Because he can't use chakra without the cursed seal activating, Sasuke is forced to only use taijutsu, something that proves difficult when Yoroiabsorbshis chakra whenever he gets close. Sasuke ends up mimicking the portion of Rock Lee's Front Lotus that he saw a few days earlier, inventing theLion Comboto defeat Yoroi. Afterwards, Kakashi takes Sasuke aside and uses theEvil Sealing Methodon his cursed seal so that it won't flare up as often. Sasuke loses consciousness from the application and by the time he wakes up the preliminaries are already over. Sasuke fighting Gaara. For the final matches taking place in a month, Sasuke was to faceGaaraofSunagakurein the first round. In order to prepare him for this fight, and to give him an alternative to the cursed seal's power, Kakashi teaches him how to use theChidoriand helps him further emulate Lee's speed and fighting style. Their training runs long and Sasuke in fact arrives late for his match, but he finds that they waited for him because the audience has anticipated the fight so much. Sasuke uses his speed to attack Gaara from multiple angles in a short time, leaving hisShield of Sandunable to block everything. Gaara surrounds himself with his sand so that Sasuke won't bother him while hepreparesfor the fight. Unable to get through the shield with physical attacks, Sasuke pierces it with Chidori.

By the time Sasuke catches up with him, Gaara is already in the process of transforming into Shukaku. Gaara attacks with increased speed and strength, which Sasuke is only narrowly able to avoid. He counters with Chidori and succeeds in injuring Gaara yet again, but Gaara is still able to continue fighting; Sasuke, who has already reached his limit of using Chidori twice a day, is low on options. He is able to use a third Chidori by using his cursed seal, but is left paralysed afterwards and at Gaara's mercy. Sasuke is saved by the timely arrival of Naruto and Sakura, sent by Kakashi to provide assistance. Sakura is quickly captured and Naruto initially struggles against Gaara.

What is Sasuke's relationship with Naruto?,He is jealous of Naruto,Sasuke recovery mission,"Main article:Sasuke Recovery Mission Sasuke and Naruto's fight is stopped by Kakashi. While recuperating, Sasuke reflects on his encounter with Itachi and is upset that, after all this time, Itachi is still so much stronger than he is. He is also jealous of Naruto who, despite being the worst student in their Academy class, has seemingly surpassed Sasuke, evidenced by his defeat of Gaara. Determined to prove himself superior, Sasuke challenges Naruto to a fight when he comes to visit him in the hospital. At first, Naruto refuses because Sasuke is still in no condition to fight, but Sasuke persists and Naruto agrees. The fight escalates quickly, culminating with Sasuke using Chidori and Naruto usingRasengan. Kakashi arrives and deflects their attacks into opposing water towers before they can clash. Sasuke initially believes his Chidori was at least stronger based on the damage to their respective water towers, but on closer examination finds that Naruto's water tower is destroyed. Sasuke leaves, jealous of Naruto's development. Kakashi tracks Sasuke down afterwards and lectures him; the Chidori is supposed to be used to protect friends, not attack them. Kakashi reminds Sasuke that, no matter how painful the losses of the past are, it would be worse to lose the friends he still has. Kakashi leaves him to think over what he said, and Sasuke becomes conflicted between his desire for revenge and his friendship with Naruto and Sakura. Before he can take Kakashi's words to heart, Sasuke is confronted by theSound Four. Sent by Orochimaru, the Sound Four fight with Sasuke to test his abilities and quickly defeat him. He tries using his cursed seal to gain the upper-hand, but discovers that they each have cursed seals also.

Desperate to become stronger than Itachi, Sasuke decides to take the Sound Four up on the offer and leaves during the night. As he approaches the village's exit he is met by Sakura, who tries to persuade him to stay so as not to break up Team 7. When this doesn't work, Sakura confesses her love for him and asks to be allowed to accompany him at the very least. Sasuke refuses again so she threatens to call for help. He stops her by knocking her out, but thanks her before he does. He meets the Sound Four outside the village and they start guiding him to Orochimaru. Once they're far enough away from Konoha, the Sound Four give Sasuke some medication that will mature his cursed seal to a second, stronger stage. He is left unconscious while his body adjusts to the drug, but when he finally wakes up many hours later his body is much stronger. Ecstatic, Sasuke continues on to Orochimaru by himself, paying little attention to the Sound Four's ongoing battle with theSasuke Recovery Team. Sasuke is stopped at theValley of the Endby Naruto. Sasuke ignores his pleas to return to Konoha and is unmoved by Naruto's warnings that Orochimaru willtake his body, believing that such a sacrifice is worthwhile if it will lead to Itachi's death. Naruto starts attacking him, ready to take him back to Konoha by force if necessary. Sasuke returns the attacks as a way of resuming the fight that Kakashi interrupted earlier. He also decides to kill Naruto, remembering Itachi's explanation that killing one's closest friend will awaken theMangekyō Sharingan.

Sasuke becomes angry and asks Naruto why he would go so far for him, to which Naruto responds that Sasuke is like a brother to him and that he simply can't let him go. Sasuke acknowledges their bond and promises to sever it, but does at least put on theforehead protectorthat he'd until now refused to do Naruto the courtesy of wearing; he boasts that Naruto will not even be able to scratch the forehead protector.

Sasuke clashes his Chidori with Naruto's Rasengan, and within the dome of resulting energy they trade final blows: Sasuke punches Naruto and Naruto scratches Sasuke's forehead protector . Sasuke spares Naruto's life. When the energy dissipates, Sasuke stands over an unconscious Naruto, wounded and with no energy left to finish him. He decides not to kill him since that's what Itachi would want him to do, and he refuses to let Itachi decide his actions.

When Orochimaru finally returns, Sasuke demands that he resume their training. Before complying, Orochimaru introduces him toSai, his replacement in Team 7, but Sasuke isn't interested. Sai tries to engage Sasuke by discussing Naruto, prompting Sasuke to knock him over withkilling intent. Sai persists, telling Sasuke that Naruto thinks of him as a brother. Sasuke replies he has only one brother whom he will kill. Sai tracks him down later as he rests.

Sasuke prepares to kill Naruto. Naruto, Sakura, andYamato are attracted to the site of Sasuke's attack; Sai is unharmed and is prepared to help them bring him back to Konoha. Sasuke reacts with indifference to Sakura and Naruto, chastising the latter for still pursuing him after all these years. Sasuke also goes on to tell Naruto that he couldn't simply break their bond by killing him and he only spared Naruto's life from their first fight on a whim but intends to kill him for real this time. To demonstrate that they mean nothing to him, Sasuke quickly neutralises them all, his growth under Orochimaru being far greater than any of them expected. Naruto, frustrated by this, struggles to avoid the temptation of using the Nine-Tails. Seeing this, Sasuke enters Naruto's subconscious using his Sharingan and suppresses the Nine-Tails, but not before the beast noted Sasuke's similarity to Madara Uchiha in terms of visual prowess and chakra. He escapes Yamato's attempt to capture him and prepares to kill them all, but is stopped by Orochimaru. Orochimaru points to their recent successes againstAkatsuki, the organisation that Itachi belongs to, and explains that letting them live may further weaken Akatsuki, thereby making it easier to kill Itachi. Sasuke accepts this reasoning and they leave Team 7 behind."

When they finally face to face, Sasuke and Itachi start by trading genjutsu, within which they trade taijutsu attacks. During a temporary lull, Sasuke questions Itachi about a suspicion he's long had: that someone helped Itachi kill the Uchiha clan. Itachi confirms he was helped byMadara Uchiha, one of Konoha's founders, but Sasuke doesn't believe him. While explaining Madara's history, Itachi also reveals that use of theMangekyō Sharinganeventually causes blindness, which can only be cured by taking the eyes of a sibling.

Angry that Itachi could endure his strongest attack and having exhausted his own chakra reserves, Sasuke activates level two of his cursed seal. Itachi pokes Sasuke's forehead for the last time. Orochimaru, sensing Sasuke's desperation, calls out to him from within his subconscious, promising to help him if Sasuke lets him out. Having exhausted all of his chakra reserves and having none left to suppress Orochimaru, he emerges from Sasuke's body, attacking Itachi with hisEight Branches Technique. Itachi uses Susanoo to behead Orochimaru's jutsu, but he isn't concerned, having decided to take Sasuke's body while he's weak. Itachi stops him by stabbing him with theSword of Totsuka, sealing him away and removing the cursed seal from Sasuke's body. Itachi approaches Sasuke, repeating his intention to take Sasuke's eyes, and Sasuke makes futile attempts to keep him away. Susanoo continues to protect Itachi, but it degrades as he labours near and Itachi starts coughing up blood. When he finally reaches Sasuke, Itachi appears to grab for his eyes but instead only pokes his forehead. Itachi smiles, apologises to Sasuke, and says this is the end before falling dead. Sasuke is confused about what has happened, but smiles for finally avenging his family before passing out. Sasuke meets Tobi. When Sasuke wakes up, he finds his injuries being treated by Tobi, who reintroduces himself as Madara Uchiha. When he sees Tobi's Sharingan, Sasuke's eyes suddenly use Amaterasu on him. Tobi escapes the flames and marvels at the lengths Itachi would go through to protect Sasuke. Sasuke doesn't understand this and accuses Tobi of lying to him, but Tobi insists that everything he says is true: that Itachi killed the Uchiha clan on orders of Konoha's leadership in order to protect Sasuke. Sasuke is unable to process this and passes out again. When he wakes up, Tobi starts over, explaining the Uchiha's history, Konoha's history, and Itachi's history from the beginning. Sasuke tries pointing how hard Itachi tried to kill him, to which Tobi replies that it was only to draw out Orochimaru so as to stop him from manipulating Sasuke any further. Sasuke starts recalling memories he blocked out, things Itachi said, and occurrences that make more sense with Tobi's version of events. Realising how much Itachi loved him, Sasuke is overcome with grief."
What is the name of Sasuke's brother?,Kinaand Reishi Kodon,Naruto jinraiden: the day the wolf howled,"Main article:Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf HowledIn this novel, Sasuke starts experiencing eye irritation in the days after Itachi's death. Tobi gives him a bottle ofKotarō, a medicine that Itachi used to use. It helps, but very little of it remains. Hoping to get more and to verify parts of the story that Tobi told him, Sasuke goes to theHowling Wolf Village. There, he meetsKinaandReishi Kodon, two brothers whose relationship is very similar to the one Sasuke used to have with Itachi when they were younger. They recognise Sasuke before he even introduces himself, having heard so much about him from Itachi that they feel as though they already know him. They explain that Itachi would visit them a couple times every year to get another prescription of Kotarō and that, while waiting for it to be prepared, he would tell them warmly about his beloved little brother. Itachi also explained to them that, if Sasuke ever stopped by, it would be because he had died, so they share their condolences. Sasuke is saddened by this confirmation that Itachi was a good person. Wishing to be alone, he places an order for more Kotarō before going off to rest in the same shack Itachi used to stay in. During the week it will take the Kotarō to be made, Kina convinces Sasuke to help him investigate a series of murders that have been taking place in the area, hoping it will redeem theirKodon clan. During the course of the investigation, Sasuke discovers that Kina is behind the murders, killing villagers who pick on him by inadvertently releasingRōen, a monster sealed within him; every time this happens, Reishi wipes his memory so that he won't be traumatised by what he did. With the village starting to suspect that one of the brothers is responsible, Reishi asks Sasuke to help convince them that he is the murderer in order to spare Kina. Sasuke, again reminded of the relationship between Itachi and himself, agrees. Kina, however, doesn't want anything to happen to Reishi, and once again inadvertently releases Rōen and starts attacking the Howling Wolf Village. Because of the nature of the seal containing Rōen, they have only ten minutes to perform another seal or Kina will die. Sasuke suggests a new seal concocted by Itachi before he died: Sasuke keeps Rōen busy with his Mangekyō Sharingan, it having finally awakened on coming to terms with Itachi's death; Reishi performs the seal, trapping Rōen in a nearby shrine at the cost of his life. Kina is saved and is given sole credit for stopping Reishi and saving the village, Sasuke having altered the villagers' memories with genjutsu. Kina, unable to remember anything, doubts this story is true, unwilling to believe Reishi was a murderer. Sasuke offers to take Kina with him and train him to be a ninja, but Kina refuses, wishing to stay in the Howling Wolf Village and help people like Reishi did. Sasuke vows to destroy Konoha. As in the manga and anime, Sasuke gathers the members of Hebi with Tobi watching from nearby. Having finally accepted that Itachi was a good person who was wronged by Konoha, he decides that the new mission for their team, now renamed ""Taka"", will be to destroy Konoha."
What does Sasuke want to talk to Itachi about?,what's currently happening in the world,Fourth shinobi world war: climax,"Main article:Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax Sasuke leaves Mountains' Graveyard. Sasuke leaves the Mountains' Graveyard and wanders through two towns, but finds both strangely empty. When members of theWhite Zetsu Armycome after him, Sasuke asks what's currently happening in the world. The Zetsus avoid answering and try to capture him. He destroys most of them with Amaterasu and interrogates one other with a genjutsu. The Zetsu reveals that Tobi has initiated theFourth Shinobi World Warin order to capture Killer B and Naruto. Sasuke decapitates this last Zetsu and then goes looking for Naruto himself, intending to make good on his promise to kill him. Immediately upon entering a nearby forest, Sasuke sees Itachi going in the opposite direction. Sasuke gives chase, desperately wanting to talk to Itachi. Because he has business elsewhere, Itachi doesn't stop to talk, but he does field some of Sasuke's questions: Itachi has been brought back with theImpure World Reincarnation; he spared Sasuke all those years ago because Sasuke was only a child, innocent of the rest of the Uchiha's conspiracies against Konoha; he pushed Sasuke onto a path of vengeance because he regretted killing their family and wanted Sasuke to hold him accountable for his actions; the criminal activities Sasuke has been involved in since his death are not what Itachi wanted, as he wished for Sasuke to be regarded as a hero for killing him. This only angers Sasuke, who says Itachi had no right to decide his fate. As he approaches his destination, Itachi tells Sasuke to remain outside. Sasuke ignores him and follows him into the cave where the user of the Impure World Reincarnation is hiding. Sasuke joins forces with Itachi against Kabuto. Sasuke initially believes the user is Orochimaru, but on closer inspection recognises him asKabuto Yakushi. Confused of the situation, Sasuke demands answers and Kabuto gives him the goal behind the war: by capturing Naruto and B, and using all nine tailed beasts, Tobi plans to resurrect the Ten-Tails, become its jinchūriki, and cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi on the world. Sasuke also learns that he had been promised as a compensation for Kabuto by Tobi in exchange for his cooperation. Disapproving of Tobi and Kabuto's war against the nations, Sasuke is angry for being used and manipulated all along. Because Itachi's mission is to stop Kabuto so as to end the Impure World Reincarnation, Sasuke tries to end things quickly by simply killing him. Itachi blocks his attack, explaining that the Impure World Reincarnation will not be ended if Kabuto dies and that their only option is to trap him in a genjutsu. Aware of this, Kabuto avoids making eye contact with either of them, instead sending out his snakes to attack them. They counter with their Susanoo, but Sasuke notices that the snakes, as well as Kabuto himself, display abilities similar to Suigetsu and Karin. Kabuto explains that he's altered his body using Orochimaru's research of both of them; he's done the same for Jūgo, which has enabled him to enterSage Mode. Sasuke pins Kabuto with his Susanoo. In Sage Mode, Kabuto shields his eyes so that he's immune to genjutsu. Needing to coordinate, Itachi reminds Sasuke of a mission they went on as children to hunt a boar, which they reenact with their Susanoo against Kabuto. Kabuto avoids them and commandeersSasuke's sword, which he uses to attack Itachi. Itachi takes the sword back from him and uses it to cut off the tip of one of Kabuto's horns. Kabuto tries to turn Sasuke against Itachi, pointing out that Itachi has been lying to him for most of his life. Itachi admits to having made mistakes in how's he's handled Sasuke, but he promises to tell Sasuke something after they've stopped Kabuto, for which purpose he's already started usingIzanami. Itachi imparts his final words to Sasuke. Kabuto resumes his attack, using a variety of jutsu available to him through Sage Mode and his research of others, namely theSound Fiveand even Orochimaru. Because his body is immortal, Itachi focuses on protecting Sasuke from harm while waiting for an opportunity to complete the Izanami. When the opportunity presents itself, Itachi allows Kabuto to take Sasuke's sword again, which Itachi once again takes back and uses to cut off the tip of the same horn. This creates a loop of sensation that is independent of vision, trapping Kabuto in a genjutsu and ending the battle. Itachi then instructs Kabuto to end the Impure World Reincarnation. As Kabuto does the hand seals, Sasuke tells Itachi that he can't do as Itachi wished and forgive Konoha for taking away his clan and brother. Itachi apologises for ever expecting him to, remarking that the clan's destruction might have been avoided had he been honest with Sasuke from the start. As Itachi begins to disappear, Sasuke says he intends to destroy Konoha no matter what Itachi says, and Itachi recognises he cannot change Sasuke's mind. Rather than poke Sasuke's head as he always did, Itachi rests his forehead on Sasuke's and tells Sasuke that he will love him no matter what choice he makes; his soul then departs to thePure Land. Sasuke returns to Konoha. With Itachi's parting words, Sasuke starts to question the meaning of a shinobi, a village, and a clan, and doesn't know what he should do now. When he is found by Suigetsu and Jūgo, they inform him that Madara Uchiha escaped the release of the Impure World Reincarnation, leaving Itachi's last mission unfinished. Before deciding how he feels about this, Sasuke decides he wants to find Orochimaru. To that end, Jūgo locatesAnko Mitarashi, who still has a cursed seal. Sasuke then uses theEvil Releasing Methodon her in order to revive Orochimaru from her cursed seal. Although insisting he still desired revenge, Sasuke explains to Orochimaru that he wants to understand the world better so that he can, in turn, understand Itachi and decide which side of the conflict should he pick. Curious about this change that has come over Sasuke, Orochimaru leads him, Suigetsu, and Jūgo to theNaka Shrinein Konoha. There, Orochimaru releases the souls of the first four Hokage from the stomach of theShinigamiand then uses the White Zetsu spores that Sasuke was secretly planted with as sacrifices to reincarnate the Hokage. Sasuke makes his decision to protect Konoha. Sasuke briefly summarises the current events of the Fourth Shinobi World War. Before he chooses which side to take in the conflict, he wants to know more about what Konoha is and also what it was intended to be, which may in turn help him understand the sacrifices Itachi made when he was alive. Each of the Hokage gives their own thoughts on Konoha and the Uchiha and what they did while they were in office to reconcile the two, at times, opposing forces. From listening to them, particularly theFirst Hokage, Sasuke decides that Konoha is worth protecting, as its destruction would only nullify everything that Itachi did in his life. He heads towards the battlefield and allows the Hokage to accompany. As they leave, Karin tracks them down and vents her anger at Sasuke, but immediately forgives his earlier attempt on her life after he simply apologises to her. Team 7 reborn. The Hokage reach the battlefield before he does, but he is no less willing to help theAllied Shinobi Forcesdefeat theTen-Tails. With the exception of Naruto, all of Sasuke's former comrades are confused and suspicious of his sudden arrival and demand an explanation. Sasuke replies he has decided to protect the village and he wants to be Hokage to change the current ninja system. When they retort that's impossible and remind him of his past actions, Sasuke says he doesn't care about that. Nevertheless, he joins forces with Naruto and Sakura, along with the original Rookie Nine. The now reunited Team 7 charges into battle, cutting through the Ten-Tails' army ofclones. Because the clones' numbers are too great, Team 7 decides to perform their own summonings so that they can focus on the Ten-Tails itself; Sasuke summonsAoda. Once close enough, Sasuke and Naruto combine efforts into theScorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero, successfully damaging the Ten-Tails' arm. Naruto wants to free the captured tailed beasts but Sasuke prefers to let them burn. Tobi appears above the Ten-Tails shortly afterwards and starts performing a jutsu. Sasuke and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces try to stop him, but they fail and Obito becomes the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki."
What is the name of the Hokage that Sasuke and Naruto attack Obito first?,Jinchriki Sasuke,Birth of the ten-tails' jinchūriki,"Main article:Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki Sasuke and Naruto attack Obito. Sasuke allows the Hokage to attack Obito first, taking advantage of their immortal bodies to test Obito's new abilities. When the first three Hokage are quickly defeated, Sasuke prepares to join in with his Susanoo, but Obito'sTruth-Seeking Ballsquickly pierce through it and Obito grabs both him and Naruto. TheFourth Hokagerescues them and tries fighting Obito on his own, but he suffers a defeat just like the other Hokage did. After regrouping, Sasuke and Naruto, with assistance from the Fourth andSecond Hokage, use another attack on Obito and smile when they succeed in landing a direct hit. Although this attack actually succeeds in hitting Obito, they discover that his new body is impervious to most conventional forms of attack. Sasuke and Naruto slash through Obito. From testing with different jutsu, Naruto discovers that Obito is vulnerable tosenjutsu. He and the Fourth exploit this weakness by entering Sage Mode and attacking. Seeing how strong Naruto has become, Sasuke grows jealous and angry. After he recovers, Obito recreates theGod Tree's tree in order to carry out theEye of the Moon Planas well as to decimate the Allied Shinobi Forces. As some Allied shinobi, including Naruto, start fearing that the battle is lost, Sasuke uses his Susanoo to cut through one of the tree's roots and berates Naruto for nearly giving up, which inspires Naruto to continue fighting. Sasuke then has Jūgo imbue his Susanoo withsenjutsu chakra, allowing him to assist Naruto in Nine Tails Mode in attacking Obito. Despite working together, Naruto and Sasuke attack separately, which Obito proves consistently able to avoid or block. Deciding to combine efforts, Sasuke coats his Susanoo around Naruto'sTailed Beast Mode, increasing its offensive and defensive capabilities. With further assistance from the rest of theKonoha 11, they succeed in cutting Obito down and ultimately removing thetailed beastsfrom his body. Sasuke is stabbed by Madara. Obito is unable to move after his defeat and Sasuke prepares to finish him off. Kakashi stops him and offers to deal with Obito himself, sending Sasuke to help Naruto deal with Madara, who was fighting the First Hokage. By the time he arrives there, however, Madara has beenrestored to lifeand has neutralised the First. Sasuke was quick to notice Madara had been restored into living flesh and tries to burn him with Amaterasu. When this failed because Madara absorbed the flames, Sasuke resorts to physical attacks with his sword, but Madara dodges and asks that Sasuke join forces with him, impressed by his abilities. When Sasuke refuses, Madara advises that he stay out of his way or else he will die. Madara goes on to recapture the tailed beasts, including those sealed within Killer B and Naruto. As he prepares to revive the Ten-Tails and become its jinchūriki like Obito before him, Sasuke attacks again but is caught in mid-air by Madara. Having already warned Sasuke once, Madara stabs him in the chest with his own sword. Sasuke tries to get up, determined to not let Madara win and, in turn, let Itachi's memory be sullied, but he passes out as the life fades from him. Sasuke and Naruto accept Hagoromo's power. On the edge of death, Sasuke is met byHagoromo Ōtsutsuki, the famed Sage of Six Paths. Hagoromo warns Sasuke about theInfinite Tsukuyomithat Madara is planning to use. Because Sasuke is the reincarnation ofIndra, Hagoromo's oldest son, Hagoromo can give him half of his power that, in combination with the half he gives to Naruto will enable them to stop the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Sasuke agrees and receives theSix Paths Yin Power. He regains consciousness and finds that the damage to his body has been healed by Kabuto, who escaped the Izanami and now feels indebted to Itachi. Sasuke's left eye, meanwhile, has become aRinnegan. Sasuke releases Tobirama from Madara'srestraintsand has himteleporthimself to Naruto's location. Sasuke bisects Madara. Arriving as Naruto is facing Madara, Sasuke uses his Rinnegan to see Madara'sinvisible doppelganger. When Madara tried to steal Sasuke's left eye, Sasukeswitched placeswith his sword, causing Madara to impale himself. While Madara recovers from the injury, Naruto and Sasuke attack from opposing sides in an effort to activate the seal given to them by Hagoromo. Madara escapes at the last moment and goes after Kakashi, taking his Sharingan. Sasuke catches up to Madara andbisectshim, but he usesKamuion his upper half to swapdimensions. Sasuke is later surprised to see Sakura appear after Obito used Kamui to save her from Madara. Regrouping with Team 7 and unsure when he'll return, Sasuke warns the others to be on guard. While they wait, Kakashi remembers when his team first introduced themselves years ago and wonders what Sasuke's intents are now that Itachi is gone. When asked this, Sasuke doesn't reply and Kakashi doesn't push it because they have more things to worry about. Sensing Madara coming, Kakashi reminds them of Team 7's first lesson: the importance of teamwork. Madara eventually returns with his other Rinnegan. Sakura launches the first attack and Sasuke follows close behind her. When she is stabbed by Madara's rode, Sasuke uses Chidori Sharp Spear to cut off the rode and allow Naruto to get her away. Sasuke sees four more Madaras and has Naruto fight them While Madara moves into position to use the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Madara rains numerousChibaku Tenseidown on Team 7. Sasuke cuts through several with hisComplete Body — Susanoo, but he isn't able to reach Madara in time to stop the Infinite Tsukuyomi from being cast."
What does Sasuke use to shield Naruto and Naruto from the Infinite Tsukuyomi's effects?,Susanoo,Kaguya ōtsutsuki strikes,"Main article:Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes Sasuke shields Team 7 from the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Sasuke hurries back to Naruto and uses his Susanoo to shield him, Sakura, and Kakashi from the Infinite Tsukuyomi's effects. Naruto tries to go check on the others but Sasuke tells him to be patient. Sakura asks what is happening but Sasuke tells her and then Kakashi they don't need to know because there is nothing they can do and assumes leadership of Team 7 because he believes only he can stop the Infinite Tsukuyomi with his Rinnegan. When they emerge, they find Madara has bound the world's population withGod: Nativity of a World of Treesand trapped them all within perpetual dreams. Madara confronts them and insists that he has ended all conflicts and that only Team 7, as the only remaining opposition, would seek to renew the cycle of death that plagued the world for centuries, which Sasuke retorts that Madara is disillusioned. As he's talking, Madara is stabbed from behind byBlack Zetsuand his body is converted intoKaguya Ōtsutsuki, which leaves Team 7 shocked. Kaguya thwarts Naruto and Sasuke's sealing attempt. Sasuke and Naruto recognise Kaguya from his meeting Hagoromo as the origin of chakra. Although she now has access to the chakra of those trapped within the Infinite Tsukuyomi, she wants Team 7's too, specifically Naruto's and Sasuke's. She transports them to one ofKaguya's Dimensions: a sea of lava. Sasuke summonsGarudato save himself and Naruto, ignoring Kakashi, Sakura, and an unconscious Obito Uchiha. Sasuke reminds Naruto that only they can stop Kaguya, and therefore what happens to the others doesn't matter. Naruto understands, but he actually can't help but save them anyway, reminding Sasuke of when he saved him in theLand of Waves. Naruto engages Kaguya while Sasuke attacks from above with his Susanoo. Kaguya repels him and he nearly falls in the lava — he drops his sword and loses it to that fate — but he's able to teleport to safety withAmenotejikara. While they try to come up with a way to place Hagoromo's seal on her, Kaguya sneaks up behind Naruto and Sasuke, paralyses them with Black Zetsu, and starts absorbing their chakra. Black Zetsu reveals its role in manipulating the Uchiha clan as part of its plan of resurrecting Kaguya, which angers Sasuke. Naruto breaks them free and distracts her with hisSexy Reverse Harem Technique, which nearly allows them to initiate the seal. She shifts dimensions before they connect, encasing them in ice. Sasuke shatters the ice withBlaze Release: Kagutsuchi, only for Kaguya to then grab him and send him off by himself to a dimension of sand dunes. Sasuke attacks Kaguya. Sasuke wanders the dunes, finding the spot where Naruto's chakra signature is strongest. There, he is shortly afterwards found by Obito and Sakura, who with considerable effort are able to briefly open a portal between dimensions. Sasuke uses Amenotejikara to teleport to Sakura's side by switching places with her flak jacket, catches Sakura as she is about to collapse from exhaustion, thanks her and Obito, and is then reunited with Naruto. Frustrated that her attempt to separate them failed, Kaguya shifts to a dimension with powerful gravity, immobilising them while she kills them with herAll-Killing Ash Bones. Kakashi shields Sasuke from her attack while Obito shields Naruto while using Kamui to warp the bone that was meant to hit and kill Kakashi; only Obito dies. Sasuke forces himself up and nearly hits Kaguya with a Chidori, forcing her to shift dimensions to somewhere with normal gravity. As Naruto stays with a dying Obito, Sasuke goes after Kaguya on his own. Team 7 seals Kaguya with Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei. Sasuke uses Susanoo to fight her by himself until Naruto, done grieving for Obito, comes to join him. Naruto'sSuper Tailed Beast Rasenshurikendestabilises the tailed beasts' chakra within her, prompting her to create anExpansive Truth-Seeking Ballto destroy them all. With the end near, Team 7 mobilises for its final assault: Kakashi, using chakra received from Obito, pierces though her; Naruto, with additional help from Kakashi, uses shadow clones to exhaust her countermeasures; Sasuke teleports closer to her in order to initiate the seal and prepares his left eye to fire Amaterasu in the event she tried to teleport to the ice world again; Sakura punches her when she tries to escape. When both Naruto and Sasuke make contact with her, the tailed beasts are removed from Kaguya's body and she is entombed with theSix Paths — Chibaku Tensei. Sasuke declares his revolution. Having been waiting for this, Hagoromo then summons them all back to the real world with the help of the deadKageand congratulates them for their victory. Madara has also been returned so Sasuke prepares to kill him, but Hagoromo stops him, explaining that Madara is dying anyway. After Madara shares his dying words with the First Hokage, Hagoromo returns the Kage's souls to the Pure Land. Hagoromo also informs Naruto and Sasuke that they can release the world from the Infinite Tsukuyomi by simply joining hands. However, Sasuke has other things he'd like to do first: he starts by placing the tailed beasts under his control with a genjutsu, traps them with Chibaku Tensei, and promises to release the Infinite Tsukuyomi only after he has killed the current Kage. Sasuke explains that the tailed beasts have too often been a source of conflict and that the Kage have consistently failed to keep the peace; the world would be better off without any of them, and declares the start of his revolution. Sasuke and Naruto begin fighting at the Valley of the End. Because Naruto is the only one who can challenge him at this point, Sasuke states his intention to kill him. Sakura tried to dissuade him by telling him she still loves him and pleading for him to return home if he ever loved her. However, Sasuke used his Sharingan genjutsu to make Sakura fall asleep. Condemned by Kakashi for this, Sasuke tells Kakashi there is no reason for him and Sakura to love each other and her love is a remnant of a ""failed"" past. Sasuke then travels to theValley of the End— the same place where he and Naruto last fought — and waits for Naruto to come to him. When Naruto arrives, he tells Sasuke it's impossible to do everything alone like he plans to, pointing to the missteps Itachi made and their own successful teamwork against Kaguya. Sasuke replies that he only wants to remake a better world, one where he can, like Itachi before, be solely responsible for the difficult decisions that must be made so that nobody else needs to; this is what he believes a true ""Hokage"" to be. To do this, Sasuke says he intends to ""erase"" the past by severing all his bonds and kill Naruto. Enraged, Naruto insists he will be Hokage, not Sasuke, because Sasuke is still going against what Itachi wanted for him and they start fighting. Naruto and Sasuke's attacks collide. After a brief exchange of blows reminiscent of their fight years ago, Naruto and Sasuke start trading punches with their Tailed Beast Mode and Susanoo. Sasuke chastises Naruto for not attacking with an intent to kill, but Naruto, like last time, is unwilling to do that, not wishing for either of them to go without the other. Sasuke uses his Susanoo to perform Chidori and Naruto uses Tailed Beast Mode to make aTailed Beast Ball, which they clash with. The collision of the two attacks creates a large explosion, doing noticeable but not debilitating damage to their respective avatars. As they mentally connect, Naruto says there is no guarantee his plan will work out and Sasuke replies that doesn't matter, because thanks to his Six Paths power, he has options for immortality to allow him to watch over the world for eternity. Each therefore powers up the avatars, Sasuke by channelling the captured tailed beasts into his Susanoo and Naruto by merging his avatar with the avatars of two shadow clones. The two meet attacks once again, this time creating a giant explosion that strips away their avatars and leaves them with too little chakra to use it practically. They instead resort totaijutsu, kicking and punching each other into the night. Naruto and Sasuke's final clash. As they near exhaustion, Naruto musters what little chakra he can, which Sasuke immediatelyabsorbs. However, as the chakra was not moulded to fit Sasuke's chakra signature, he wasn't able to utlise it. Having expected this, Naruto delivers a solid punch, finally irritating Sasuke over the endless repetition of their fight. Sasuke uses Chidori and Naruto, taking the last remaining chakra the Nine-Tails can give him, counters with Rasengan. With Naruto waking up earlier to find that much of the Valley of the End had been destroyed, that they had each lost an arm, and that neither could move. Sasuke wakes up afterwards and asks Naruto why he continues to try to stop him and never gives up on him. Naruto's usual response that they're friends doesn't convince Sasuke since it obviously goes beyond that, so Naruto elaborates that he experiences pain whenever Sasuke is going through a tough time. Sasuke is shocked, knowing full well that Naruto has experienced various misfortunes in his life, smiled through all of them, yet would suffer without him. Sasuke thinks about their childhood of being orphans and how Sasuke came to see Naruto as a friend because they shared the same pain. Naruto and Sasuke reconcile. Both went to sleep again because of exhaustion. Sasuke dreams of his brother and recaps all the obstacles Naruto went through to get stronger. Sasuke has an epiphany; after years of trying to push the bonds with his friends away, Sasuke realises his desire to return to them and feels guilty for having rejected them for his selfish goals. When they wake up the next day, Sasuke is surprised that they are still alive and laughs when Naruto is angry and still wants to beat him as he is too weak to fight him in this condition. Sasuke finally admits defeat, as he's come to accept that Naruto is just as vital to him as he is to Naruto. He asks Naruto to give his Rinnegan to Kakashi in order to undo the Infinite Tsukuyomi but he wants to end his own life in order to atone his sins, but Naruto refuses and vows to be there for his friend no matter what, which moves Sasuke to tears. Sakura and Kakashi arrive and Sakura begins healing them. Guilt-ridden for the pain he put Sakura through, Sasuke tries to speak to her but she tells him not to because she needs to concentrate on healing them. Sasuke then apologises to Sakura for everything he's done, which she tearfully accepts and Sasuke smiles at her. All the while as Kakashi looks on with joy as Team 7 reunites for good. Sasuke and Naruto do a rat hand seal to undo the Infinite Tsukuyomi and free everyone and the tailed beasts. As they do so, Sasuke talks about how he and Naruto have come to understand each other's feelings and pain, and he finally understands why Naruto never gave up on him. In the anime, following the war, Sasuke is kept in the custody of theKonoha Torture and Interrogation Force, until his fate is decided."

As Sasuke starts investigating Kaguya Ōtsutsuki during his journey of redemption, he is forced to examine his former role as an avenger and how this past will influence his future. During his travelling, he receives a message from Kakashi regarding the disappearances of Konoha, Kumo, and Kiri shinobi and Sasuke agrees to investigate. On his way to the Land of Lightning, Sasuke arrives at a bamboo village in theLand of Hot Waterand learns from the villagers of a rogue ninja group called theDark Thunder Group, whose leader,Karyū, admires Sasuke yet wants to kill him in order to surpass him. At the village, he meets two wandering shinobi, Chino and Nowaki. Sasuke finds the group attacking the village and defeats them, saving all the villagers from harm. Karyū admits he has admired Sasuke since the latter attacked the Kage Summit, much to Sasuke's dismay that Karyū is tarnishing his name. Before he can turn Karyū over to Konoha, Karyū is killed by the father of one of his victims. When the genjutsu fails to dispel after Karyū's death, Sasuke suspects the real culprit is on the loose. Sasuke later meets with Orochimaru and his former team Taka comrades to investigate the matter further. Sasuke frees all of the Coliseum's shinobi. Sasuke maintains contact with Sai when Konoha is attacked and discovers the origins of the Dark Thunder Group. He finds most of the missing Kiri and Kumo shinobi on an isolated island, and through luck, discovers that Chino and Nowaki are, in fact, responsible for the disappearances. After they flee, Sasuke delivers the shinobi to their villages and, at from advice from the Raikage, goes to Yugakure, where he finds and battles Chino. She reveals that she is seeking revenge due to that she is from a clan that was eliminated due to her village fearing itsKetsuryūganand she holds the Uchiha clan partially responsible. Because Sasuke understands her pain and hatred, he defeats them without seriously injuring them and convinces them to accept defeat. Sasuke drops them off at the village's prison, but he leaves a good word for them to be forgiven. After resuming his journey, Sasuke receives a letter from Naruto that mentions Sakura comparing his efforts to protect the village to that of his childhood dream of joining the Konoha Military Police Force. Sasuke decides his home is with Sakura and makes the decision to return to Konoha, where he is greeted by Sakura, ""Welcome back, Sasuke"" and he replies, ""I'm home, Sakura.""[97]"
Who does Sasuke mistake as an enemy?,Sarada,Sarada uchiha arc,"Main article:Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring Sasuke fends off his attacker. Searching throughKaguya's Dimensions, Sasuke returns to earth through hisportal. Upon arriving in a forest, both of his dōjutsu weaken from overuse. Immediately after, Sasuke is attacked by a hooded figure. Fending him off, Sasuke discovers the assailant to be ayoung boywith the Sharingan, and whose clothes bear the Uchiha crest. As he questions who the boy is, the child retreats, which prompts Sasuke to send a message by hawk to Naruto to inform him of the encounter, and to ask for a meeting with him atRidge Tower. Sasuke mistakes Sarada as an enemy. After waiting for a while, he is found by Sarada, who left Konoha to find her father. Seeing her with the Sharingan and having the Uchiha crest on her back, Sasuke suspects she is connected to the boy and almost attacks her until she calls out to him as dad, and he realises she is his own daughter. When Naruto arrives shortly afterwards, Sasuke reprimands him for bringing children like Sarada andChōchō Akimichialong. Sarada defends Naruto, insisting that she came against his wishes because she wanted to meet Sasuke, wanted to know where he'd been all these years, wanted to know if Sakura was her real mother, and who the woman with glasses from the photo of Team Taka is. He ignores her questions and says his actions have nothing to do with her, causing her to storm out, crying. Sasuke facing Shin. When Sasuke senses Naruto and Sarada being attacked byShin Uchiha- the ""father"" of the boy from before - Sasuke rushes out to lend assistance. He swats away Shin's projectiles and, when Shin takes his sword, he blasts him with aGreat Fireballand takes the sword back. However, this brief contact allows Shin to control the sword remotely with hisMangekyō Sharingan, which he uses when he has an opening to stab Naruto. Shin turns his attention to Sarada and Sasuke rushes to protect Sarada from Shin's follow-up attack and has all the blades land at him. Sakura then appears and incapacitates Shin with a punch. Sakura apologises to Sasuke for not making things clear to Sarada about his mission but Sasuke insists he is at fault before one of Shin'screaturesteleports him and Sakura away. Unable to locate their whereabouts, Sasuke believes Orochimaru knows where Shin is and, learning Shin is targeting Sarada, he decides to take her with them to ensure her safety. Sasuke, Naruto and Orochimaru discuss Shin Uchiha's origins. When they arrive, Sasuke promises retaliation against Orochimaru if he is in any way involved in the attack on his daughter or the kidnapping of his wife. Orochimaru denies responsibility, confessing that Shin is an old experiment he has long before lost control of, and says that Shin's ""sons"" are actually his genetic clones. To help them deal with Shin, Orochimaru offers some suggestions about where they might find him. When Orochimaru suggests Sakura is already dead, Sasuke denies this as a possibility due to her not being a weak woman, stating that she likely will have already finished Shin off by the time they find her. When his Rinnegan recharges from his earlier dimensional travels, Sasuke manifests his Susanoo and transports Naruto, Sarada, and Chōchō to Shin's hideout, where they are immediately met with a large mob of Shin's clones, and while Naruto and Chōchō stay outside to deal with them, Sasuke and Sarada make their way inside the hideout to locate Shin and Sakura. Sasuke attacks a giant Shin clone with Susanoo. As Sasuke guessed, Sakura already is in the middle of combat when they arrive, and Sasuke uses his Susanoo to punch the largest clone as he grabs Sakura. He pulls the scalpels out of her arm and burns them with Amaterasu before asking her if she can heal herself now. Sasuke and the others proceed to fight Shin, who is stabbed by the clones who then turn on Sasuke and Naruto. When the spying creature tries to teleport Shin once again, Sasuke calls out Sarada to warn her about that, and then she kills the creature before activating her Sharingan and using herchakra enhanced strengthto defeat some of the clones, making Sasuke smirk with pride. When the battle is over, Sasuke comments how soft Naruto is for offering to do no harm to the clones if they surrender but agrees to drop them off at the Konoha Orphanage. When Sarada learns that Sakura really is her biological mother, she asks her father if he truly feels connected to Sakura. He says yes because Sarada, as their daughter, is proof of their bond, moving Sarada to tears. Sasuke parting ways with Sarada. Sasuke spends some time with Sarada and Sakura in Konoha, even posing for their first family photo. After some time, Sasuke is about to leave again and hugs his daughter as she sadly asks him when he will come back. Sasuke tells Sarada to not make such a face and pokes her on the forehead, promising to come home soon, which makes her very happy and prompts her to smile at Sakura. Sakura then gives him a bagged lunch and hopes for a kiss in return, but he leaves without further comment, only smirking in amusement as he walks away."
What is the name of Sasuke's daughter?,Sarada,Naruto shinden: parent and child day,"Main articles:Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child DayandParent and Child Day ArcNOTE:In the anime, the events of this arc occur after theMitsuki's Disappearance Arc. Sasuke enjoys a meal with his family. As Sasuke finished business with a village near Konohagakure, he decided to return home to visit his family. There he learned from Boruto of the new village holiday, Parent and Child Day. Told where Sarada was, Sasuke decided to spend the day with his daughter. While Sarada was overjoyed at the idea, the normally poised man struggled to connect with his daughter, simply trying to get inspiration wherever he could, instead simply embarrassing Sarada. Finally having enough, Sarada stormed off. Sasuke was then approached by Sakura. He discussed with her his problem in connecting with Sarada. Sakura noted that having spent much of Sarada's life away and only hearing stories about Sasuke and his various exploits, Sarada probably became disillusioned at who Sasuke was as a person and his attempts at being a dotting father seemed lame. Ultimately, Sakura suggested that he should approach Sarada more like Sasuke's relationship was with his father and brother back in the day; just enjoying the time they have together and talk about their goals. Later, while working on her shuriken skills, Sasuke approached her again, applauding her on the goal of becoming Hokage. He insisted that she would make a better Hokage then he ever could and would support her through her struggles, much to her delight. As the day ended, she and Sasuke returned home where the entire Uchiha family enjoyed a hearty meal together."
What does Sasuke find in Kaguya's ice dimension?,a scroll,Versus momoshiki arc,"Main articles:Boruto: Naruto the MovieandVersus Momoshiki Arc Sasuke battles Kinshiki. As Sasuke continued his investigation, he found the remains of a stronger crop of White Zetsu in theMountains' Graveyard, which he proceeded to destroy withAmaterasu. Upon arriving in Kaguya's ice dimension, Sasuke locates a scroll in Kaguya's palace. There, he is attacked byKinshikiandMomoshiki Ōtsutsuki: while capable of fighting the former on equal terms, he realises he can't take them both on at once. By using his Rinnegan's abilities, he is ultimately able to escape. Unable to read the scroll with his Rinnegan, Sasuke takes it back to Konoha to have it deciphered. He stops at Naruto's house to deliver it to him, but is attacked by Naruto's son,Boruto Uzumaki, who mistook Sasuke for his father. Sasuke easily blocks the attack and asks for Naruto's whereabouts; Hinata, Naruto's wife, tells him Naruto is still at the Hokage's office. Sasuke listening to Boruto's plead. On finding Naruto, Sasuke remarks that Boruto is quite similar to him. Naruto disagrees, thinking he has more in common with Sasuke, but retracts and says Boruto isn't like him either. Naruto thinks they are behind the new generation, which Sasuke disagrees because the nature of shinobi never changes, and they make a bet over this. As Sasuke leaves to go home to his family, Boruto launches a sneak attack. Sasuke once again avoids it effortlessly and pushes Boruto over. Impressed, Boruto asks Sasuke to train him, having heard that Sasuke is Naruto only equal and thus best qualified to help him become stronger than his father. Sasuke tells Boruto to ask him again after he's learned to use theRasengan. Boruto does just that and demonstrates it after he becomes able to form it. On seeing it, Sasuke remarks that Boruto's Rasengan is quite small, which Boruto wrongly believes to mean he's been rejected, causing him to subsequently run off. Sarada then reveals herself to her father, and tries to convince him that he was being too hard on Boruto, as he usually didn't apply that kind of dedication to anything. Sasuke tells his daughter that Boruto jumped to the wrong conclusion, and that he was going to agree to make him his student. In truth, Sasuke was quite satisfied, further impressed by thelightningnature Boruto applies to his Rasengan. The next day, Boruto demonstrates a normal-sized Rasengan, which Sasuke recognises to be a result of using theKote. Boruto tries to cover this up by boasting about his exceptional skill being the reason for the remarkable progress of his Rasengan. Sasuke cryptically references the fact that Boruto was willing to cheat to attain his goal by saying Boruto was quite different from Naruto and he hoped it wasn't the case. Nonetheless, he agrees to train Boruto since he already met his requirement. He later spoke to Boruto's jōnin-sensei,Konohamaru Sarutobi, who agreed to let Sasuke take over his actual training. Sasuke and Boruto talk about Naruto. After his day training with Sasuke, the two sit by a fire and talk. Boruto starts by asking about his father's weaknesses. Sasuke explains that Naruto had many weaknesses, but nonetheless managed to pull himself up and become Hokage. Believing Boruto's approach to be incorrect - Sasuke explained that Naruto is better understood by the hardships he overcame in his life than the flaws he may still have. This doesn't satisfy Boruto, so he throws himself into training for the upcomingChūnin Exams,shurikenjutsufiguring prominently in Sasuke's lessons. While training, Boruto struggles with bending his throws - complaining that shurikenjutsu is Sarada's specialty, because she is Sasuke's daughter. Sasuke retorts this assertion by applying the same reasoning to Boruto regarding the Shadow Clone Technique, of which Boruto can only create two, as opposed to his father - who can create thousands. Sasuke keeps tabs on how deciphering the scroll is going, but it isn't until the day of the Chūnin Exams' finals that it is finally finished. Reading what it says, Sasuke finds his suspicions about the threat Kaguya was preparing for confirmed and rushes to inform Naruto. When he arrives at the stadium where the finals are being held, Kinshiki and Momoshiki are already attacking. Sasuke rescues Sarada from falling debris but is confronted by Kinshiki while he tries to get her to safety.Shikamaru Narabriefly restrains Kinshiki and Momoshiki, allowing Sasuke to tell Naruto what the scroll said: that Kinshiki and Momoshiki harvest planets' chakra in order to prolong their lives and that Kaguya was building a White Zetsu Army to prepare for their inevitable invasion. Sasuke protecting Sarada and Boruto from the Ōtsutsuki. As Momoshiki starts attacking, Naruto forms hisTailed Beast Modearound Boruto and Sarada in order to protect them; Sasuke layers his Susanoo over this to provide additional protection. The shield is insufficient against Momoshiki, so Naruto instructs Sasuke to focus on protecting the children while he fights Momoshiki alone. Sasuke does so, staying with Boruto and Sarada and, as a result, preventing him from stopping Naruto's capture. With his father gone, Boruto feels guilty about how he treated Naruto and reprimanded himself for being so uncool. Overhearing this, Sasuke affirmed Boruto's words - and noted that if it weren't for his mother and sister, he would be in the same position Naruto was in the past. After Boruto asks Sasuke how his father overcame his hardships, Sasuke suggests Boruto ask Naruto in person and also telling him Naruto is stronger than him up until now, and to that end invites Boruto to join him in rescuing him. When Boruto asks why he'd be invited and why Sasuke agreed to train him in the first place, Sasuke explains that Boruto is an exceptionally gifted shinobi has the potential to surpass Naruto because he hates to lose. The Five Kage then reveal themselves and offer their assistance to rescue Naruto, revealing they are on friendly terms with Sasuke. Before they leave, however, Sasuke lends his forehead protector to Boruto, who had his confiscated by Naruto for cheating in the exams. Sasuke and Naruto fighting Momoshiki's Golem. Sasuke uses his Rinnegan to open a portal toMomoshiki's Planet. Before they leave, Hinata tries to stop Boruto from leaving - who then puts on Sasuke's headband and affirms confidently that he's going to go save his father . Sasuke approves of this demeanour and notes that Boruto is finally starting to carry himself like a true shinobi. When they arrive on Momoshiki's planet, which has long since had its chakra harvested - the group frees Naruto from Momoshiki and Kinshiki, who had him bound to a tree resembling the God Tree, and immediately engage them in battle. Sasuke assists theSixth MizukageandFourth Tsuchikagewith restraining Kinshiki and then joins Naruto, theFifth Kazekage, and theFifth Raikageagainst Momoshiki; he warns them not to useninjutsusince Momoshiki can absorb them. Kinshiki breaks free and drives them back, then allows Momoshiki to absorb him to become stronger. Naruto and Sasuke start fighting Momoshiki with taijutsu, during the course of which Sasuke is badly burned. Naruto catches him and heals his wounds with the Nine-Tails' chakra, allowing them to combine their Tailed Beast Mode and Susanoo to strike him down. With Momoshiki down, the uninvitedKatasuketries to finish him off. This unwittingly revives him Momoshiki, giving him a chance to paralyse Naruto and the Kage with the Shadow Paralysis Jutsu while Sasuke elsewhere protects Boruto. Sasuke reunites with his family. Sasuke suggests that Boruto attack Momoshiki with his Rasengan, depending on its lightning nature to catch him off guard. This works and the Kage are freed, but an earlier injury prevents Naruto from fighting. He adds his chakra to Boruto's Rasengan, which Sasuke then helps him find an opening to use to destroy Momoshiki with. After the battle, Sasuke tells Naruto he won their bet and they return to Konoha, and Sasuke posed for a photograph with Naruto, Boruto, and the other Kage. However, in the anime, before they departed from the other dimension, Sasuke managed to catch a glimpse of Boruto's conversation with Momoshiki's fading spirit thanks to his Rinnegan, as well as notice that some technique had been used to stop the flow of time so the conversation passed unseen for everyone else. After everything returns to normal, apart from concern about the thirdŌtsutsuki foewho escaped, Sasuke meets with Boruto again. He reveals that he knows about hismarkfrom Momoshiki, insisting that Boruto let me know if anything happened from it. He also let Boruto keep his old forehead protector as a sign of being Sasuke's official pupil. Sasuke decided to take advantage of his research being analysed to spend time a few days with his family. Later, Sasuke and Sakura, both smiling, watch Sarada and her teammates leave for a mission. Soon afterwards, Sasuke returned to his investigation of the Ōtsutsuki."

Sasuke sent a messenger hawk to inform Konoha of the location and that he might be onUrashiki Ōtsutsuki's trail. There, Sasuke and Gaara fought Urashiki and hispuppets. As the two sides battled evenly, Boruto suddenly appeared, prompting Sasuke to protect his student, leading him to become distracted and Urashiki taking some of his chakra. As Sasuke lept toward his opponent, Urashiki teleported him to another dimension. Sasuke engages Urashiki. He ultimately arrived in Kaguya's ice dimension. While unharmed, his battle exhausted him too much. Sasuke was forced to spent time to recover his chakra to return to Sunagakure, as his Rinnegan was too weak to maintain a portal. Once recovering enough chakra, he detected Urashiki's repeated dimension hopping and teleported in time to stop the foe from striking down Boruto andShinki. Sasuke's return prompted Urashiki to retreat. Sasuke brought the genin to Konohagakure for treatment and reported the events to Naruto. There, it was decided that Shukaku would remain in Naruto's protection until better precautions were made."
What did Sasuke learn from Naruto and Shikamaru about Urashiki?,Urashiki was on the move again,Time slip arc,"Main article:Time Slip Arc Sasuke clashes with Urashiki. In the anime, as Sasuke began enjoying some down-time in the village, he was approached by Boruto. The pupil asked Sasuke about the nature ofJiraiya's worth as a ninja and his relationship with Naruto. Sasuke admitted that Jiraiya was a remarkable man, whose influence and guidance strongly shaped Naruto into the remarkable man he is today, even noting that they ultimately shared a father-son relationship. When Boruto asked if Sasuke could get him an ""Icha Icha"" book to learn more about the man, Sasuke bluntly refused, knowing that Boruto was too young for such an adult book. Later, Sasuke learned from Naruto and Shikamaru that Urashiki was on the move again, being even more indiscriminate in his stealing of chakra. Later, when Boruto was annoyed that he was the only genin that was put off of the mission to hunt Urashiki due to the Ōtsutsuki's previous vendetta against Boruto. Sasuke however offered an alternate plan of making Boruto a two-man team with him while staying within the village, which Naruto agreed to. Later that night, Urashiki was discovered and most of the Konoha-nin in the village went after him. Sasuke however doubted that things were working so smoothly, especially after learning that genjutsu-specialistMirai Sarutobiwent missing knowing of Urashiki's ability to replicate people's techniques from their chakra. Boruto doubted Urashiki would go after his father as he was still well-guarded. Sasuke and Boruto travel back to the past. He then realised Urashiki's true motive was an artefact found by the Konohagakure Archaeological Research team. His hunch is proven true where he and Sasuke engage in combat with Urashiki. The artefact turned out to be a turtle belonging to the Ōtsutsuki nameKarasukithat required enough chakra to operate. Urashiki activates it while Boruto and Sasuke followed him. They entered a void where they battled, knocking Urashiki off a ledge ""too soon"" for him. When Karasuki finished its operation, Boruto and Sasuke found themselves back in Konohagakure. But to their shock, they realised they had been sent to the past. Realising Urashiki's plan was to acquire Kurama's chakra from Naruto as a child, Sasuke asked Karasuki about the enemy. The turtle explained that due to Sasuke's interference, Urashiki would not arrive in this time period for a few days. It also warned Sasuke and Boruto to avoid as much interaction with the past as possible or risk severe changes to the timeline as they know it. Taking this to heart, Sasuke and Boruto disguised themselves, and stressed their situation to Boruto as he discovered how different the village was. Sasuke talking with Jiraiya. Soon afterwards, Boruto and Sasuke bumped into Naruto and Jiraiya, who were in trouble for peeping on the women's hot spring. Jiraiya handed Boruto his binoculars, trying to frame him for his peeping, but the issue was quickly resolved asTsunadearrived and scolded both Naruto and Jiraiya for their actions. Tsunade asked about Boruto and Sasuke's arrival, and Sasuke claimed they were travelling performers who utilisedninjutsuduring their performances. Still somewhat suspicious, Tsunade ordered Naruto and Jiraiya to guard Boruto and Sasuke, proclaiming thata recently defected genin, as well as Konoha still recovering froman assault during the Chūnin Exams, they needed to remain on their guard at all times, and couldn't afford to let strangers walk into their village. However, as soon as Tsunade leaves, Jiraiya left Naruto to take care of Boruto and Sasuke, much to Naruto's annoyance. As they walk around the village, they come across Sakura, and while Naruto approaches her, Sasuke leaves the area, warning Boruto that since he and Sakura were close, she could recognise him and drastically alter the future and informed Boruto to remain by Naruto's side at all times before leaving. Days later, Sasuke bumped into Sakura again, dropping an old smeared letter from Sarada in the process. Eventually, Boruto confronted Sasuke about his past, having deduced the truth about his past self's absence. Still ashamed of his past mistakes, Sasuke simply admitted that at the time, he saw no other way to accomplish his goal of revenge. When Boruto suggested finding his younger self to reason with him, Sasuke bluntly said they can't make such a risk. The following day, Urashiki finally appeared, prompting Sasuke and Boruto to guard the future Hokage. Sasuke battling against Urashiki. Urashiki acted quickly and struck Naruto with his hook, shocked to see that it failed to gain any chakra. Deciding the best course was to capture Naruto, Urashiki subdued Naruto and trap Boruto and Sasuke, along with Jiraiya, who happened along inside a stone prison. Sasuke explained to Jiraiya that he and Boruto were actually ninja from a distant village with a mission to stop Urashiki from stealing the Nine-Tails' chakra and that Urashiki had ties to Akatsuki. While seeing that they were still hiding some truth, Jiraiya decided to work with the duo, breaking them free by summoning a giant toad. Soon, Sasuke locked onto Naruto's location from detecting the tailed beast's chakra beginning to leak out. Along the way, having realised that the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style was stopping Urashiki from stealing the Nine-Tail's chakra, Jiraiya placed powerful seals on Boruto and Sasuke to protect them as well. Upon finding Naruto, Urashiki's actions forced the boy into his Version 1 state. While Sasuke engaged Urashiki, Jiraiya and Boruto went to subdue with the rampaging Naruto. Boruto attempted to reason with his father, believing that talking would restore his sanity, but quickly became horrified as his efforts failed and Naruto ended up nearly killing him before Jiraiya subdued Naruto. After Urashiki retreats, Jiraiya tends to Boruto's wound and talks about Naruto's lonely childhood and hatred suffered by the villagers, and suggests Boruto train with him, alongside Naruto, knowing the foe would return and believed that with the two children's compatible nature, they would do good to learn work together. Sasuke talking with a younger Naruto about Boruto. The following day, Sasuke watched from afar as Jiraiya began instructing Naruto and Boruto on how to synchronise their chakra to create a new cooperation ninjutsu. As the day continued and the two children struggled to complete the task, Boruto, still reeling from being attacked by Naruto's berserker attack while influenced by Kurama's chakra, decided to distance himself from the increasingly angry Naruto. Jiraiya then approached Sasuke, asking him to deliver Naruto some food while he dealt with something. Sasuke reluctantly agreed. Upon confronting his best friend's past-self, Sasuke was amazed to learn how even back then how committed Naruto was to save Sasuke from his dark path. Ashamed to see how much pain he put Naruto through, Sasuke told Naruto about how ""a friend"" struggled for years to help him after he lost his way, but never gave up until finally succeeding. After renewing Naruto's conviction, Sasuke left. He was then approached by Jiraiya again, shocking Sasuke from deducing who he really was. Taking Sasuke's shocked reaction as a confirmation of his identity, Jiraiya quickly relieved the pressure by dryly laughing off his accusation. Jiraiya could tell that Sasuke and Boruto's desire to protect Naruto was genuine and that they had their reasons for keeping secrets, he made a deal with Sasuke not to delve deeper into their true identities provided that Sasuke reveal all he knows about Urashiki. Sasuke then explained all he knew about the alien's abilities. After hearing all this, Jiraiya deemed that the best course of action would be to seal away Urashiki. Before they could formulate a proper plan, Sasuke detected Urashiki's return, speeding off with Jiraiya to help Boruto and Naruto. With Sasuke still drained from Urashiki's theft of his chakra, Sasuke struggled to keep up with the foe even with the Sannin's aid. As Urashiki repeatedly evaded his foe's attacks, he smugly told them that he cansee the future. Sasuke uses Kirin to neutralise Urashiki. Finding Urashiki's newest technique too dangerous, Sasuke tackled Urashiki and himself into the river to give his allies a chance to escape. While Urashiki emerged from the river unharmed and furious at Sasuke's constant interference, an unconscious Sasuke was fished out of the river by Sakura, who hid him and began treating him with her medical ninjutsu. Soon, Sasuke awoke, accidentally thanking Sakura by her given name. While still not fully recovered, Sasuke decided to go help his friends. Sakura began asking him questions, but her efforts at healing him exhausted her and she fainted. Sasuke gently lied her down before heading off. He arrived to see his allies facing a transformed Urashiki. Their combined efforts barely were able to compete with the foe. Ultimately, seeing his friends get hurt made Naruto unleashes his Version 1 cloak and again went on a rampage. Boruto, however, managed to reach Naruto and together were able to perfect their new collaboration technique. With the combined effort of Jiraiya and Sasuke, the two kids were able to plough through Urashiki's final attack and obliterate him. Sasuke erases Jiraiya and Naruto's memories. Days later, after everyone recovered from the battle, Sasuke and Boruto decided to leave soon as their mission was complete. They were then approached by Sakura, who demanded for Sasuke to reveal how he knew her and what the contents of his letter were about. While Sasuke struggled to answer, Jiraiya gave a convincing alibi that Sasuke and Boruto were in fact such avid fans of his, they studied up on his entire life and wished to train under him, which Boruto and Sasuke awkwardly agreed to. The following day, after Sasuke used his Sharingan toerasethe memories of everyone in the past they made contact to protect the timeline, the master and student used Karasuki to return to the time. Also, knowing that it was too dangerous for anyone to wield the turtle's power, Sasuke and Boruto convince it to go on a journey of self-discovery to find his own path. Once arriving in their present, Sasuke informed Naruto about the recent adventure and of Urashiki's demise. While Naruto was glad that peace has been restored to the world, Sasuke insisted that there were still hidden sites of Kaguya that he would have to investigate, but noted he would make sure to visit his family much more regularly."
Where did Sasuke go after learning rumours that Hagoromo tsutsukihad the same condition?,Land of Redaku,Sasuke retsuden arc,"Main articles:Sasuke Retsuden,Sasuke Retsuden andSasuke Retsuden ArcNOTE:In the anime, the events of this arc occur before theAcademy Entrance Arc.When Naruto became ill to an unknown condition, Sasuke went to theLand of Redakuafter learning rumours thatHagoromo Ōtsutsukihad the same condition and found a cure there. Once arriving, he asked around for help, but none of the citizens had any information as they were not used to seeing outsiders. He was approached byLyla, who offered to bring Sasuke to her mother,Kail, for help. Along the way to her antique shop, Kail was robbed by a group of men. Sasuke quickly subdued them with a mixture of taijutsu and his dōjutsu. Thanking Sasuke for retrieving her items, including her wedding ring from her late husband, Kail looked through old archives of Redaku history and folklore and found a connection to the Sage of Sixth Paths and theAstronomy Research Institute. As it doubled as a prison institute, Sasuke committed himself. Sasuke fighting Menō. Inside, Sasuke quickly distinguished himself as a someone not to messed with when the inmates attacked him. Despite quickly knocking out all his foes, the director of the instituteZansūru, vouched for Sasuke as only fighting in self-defence. Later, one of the inmates was killed trying to escape when he was attacked byMenōa livingvelociraptorguarding the institute. Sasuke realised there was a dark secret to the institute. Later meeting one of his cellmates,Jiji, who helped Sasuke better understand the customs of the foreign land, Sasuke made bet in a game of dice. After winning by manipulating the dice with chakra, he told his cellmates to cover for him while he investigated something outside. At night, trying to figure out how a Summoning like Menō could stay around for so long, he was found by Menō. The creature was unaffected by his genjutsu, prompting Sasuke to cut off its right talons and slice open its chest. Sasuke tries to put Zansūru in a genjutsu. The following day, Sasuke was shocked to learn that Menō was still alive and fully regenerated. He was approached by Zansūru, who realised Sasuke attacked Menō previously. Sasuke tried to subdue him with his Sharingan, but he revealed to have a glass eye, making him immune. Zansūru warned Sasuke that if he kept snooping, he would be in trouble. Soon after, Sasuke was harassed by the guards. While letting himself get beaten up, Sasuke took a guard's pass cloth to safely move about the institute. Along the way, he found another prisoner who was a victim of a prank and needed a cloth to return safely. After Sasuke gave him his, Sasuke was attacked again by Menō. Poisoned by the creature's scratch, he was forced to run away. He was found by Sakura, who infiltrated the institute as its new infirmary doctor. She treated him of his poisoning and took a sample for more testing. She revealed the new intel about how the Sage cut a meteor in two, obtainingpolar particlesthat cured of his illness. The Sage separated the particles into two groups, hiding them in ""the sky that fell to the Earth"" and ""the star that never strays"", and that to find the particles, one must ""revel with the map of the heavens"". Sakura explained the new theory that Naruto's illness comes from being a jinchūriki, and Sasuke insisted that Sakura leave with due to the unusual dangers of the institute, but she firmly refused, insisting that Sasuke needed her help. As Sasuke accepted her offer, Jiji came looking for treatment for his burst blister. Sasuke initially hid himself, but revealed himself as Sakura's husband when Jiji tried to flirt with her, interested in her pink hair, unusual to the country. She claimed to have taken the job because she missed Sasuke, as the prison didn't allow visitors. Sakura gave Sasuke a pass cloth so he could safely get back to his cell. Along the way, Jiji voiced his belief that Sasuke should commit more time to be with his wife. Sasuke asked Jiji if he knew anything about the map of the heavens, who pointed him toPenjira, who might know something as he was a library attendant. Upon asking Penjira, he checked the catalogues and found that the books Sasuke was looking for were in a secure section in the basement. Sakura approached them, claiming to have an interest in studying astronomy. Appealing to his love of gambling, Sakura played Penjira to a standstill in cards before finally relinquishing the key to her. Sasuke puts an Earth Release wedding ring on Sakura's finger. Later that night, the two went to the basement. Not wanting others to flirt with Sakura anymore, he slipped a wedding ring he made with Earth Release on her finger. While researching the books, they found an art style similar to Sai's, not native to this country. Looking deeper at the drawings, they realised that the art style seemed to be the basis of a popular card game in the Land of Redaku. The pattern revealed a connection the constellations in the stars. They also noticed the old notes contained the Konoha emblem. Sasuke trusted to Sakura to figure out the code, her passing him a note with the decrypted code days later, asking to meet her. Meeting with Sakura, he revealed his discovery that the Hoshinarabe game was based off the history of the Sage of Six Paths and the Tailed Beasts. Sakura explained that a messenger from the capital was arriving to meet with Zansūru. Sakura knocked him out and disguised herself as him, while Sasuke transformed into his staff. As Sakura conversed with Zansūru in his office, Sasuke snuck away, using his Earth Release to make a key for Zansūru's back door. It led to a cellar that was filled with stones and chickens. Before Sasuke could look more, Zansūru came in. Not taking a chance, Sasuke dispersed himself, revealed to be a shadow clone. Sasuke obtains Menō's loyalty. Later while taking with Jiji, Sasuke realised that the ""sky that fell to Earth"" half was hidden in a lake. Later, he approached Sakura, who realised that the card game was also based off the 12 hand seals in ninjutsu and that its strongest hand was the key to decode the Map of the Heavens. As the two found the site, Sasuke offhandedly asked Sakura if she would like an authentic wedding ring, Sakura politely declined. Sasuke admitted to Sakura his regret in not being around more over the years since marrying each other. As Sakura took out the playing cards to decipher the seal, Sasuke noted the back of the cards had a lizard on a rock. Sakura noted how long ago there were dragonic creatures that went extinct after a meteor crashed on the planet. As Sakura performed the hand seals to reveal the polar particles, Sasuke realised that the prisoners were digging up fossils and from that the true nature of Zansūru's plan. Suddenly several ancient dragons took to the sky, which Sasuke deduced were summoned by the Impure World Reincarnation Technique. Sasuke instructed Sakura to return and look for Zansūru, who instead arrived in a flying dragon after her departure. He learned that the jutsu used was different from Impure World Reincarnation, and from Sasuke's grasp of the situation, Zansūru determined he received intel from allies at Nagare Village. When observing Zansūru's chakra pathway system, Sasuke noticed his chakra reserves were weak, and realised Zansūru was an ordinary individual rather than a shinobi, meaning someone else revived the dragons. Sasuke dodged an attack from Menō, and Zansūru left, ordering the dragon to kill Sasuke. Sasuke managed to befriend it through a combination of kind words, genjutsu channelled through its body, and tending to its burn with supercooled mist. Sasuke fighting the dragon beasts. Based on some of the things Zansūru said during his monologue, Sasuke has figured out that it was actually Jiji behind the reincarnation technique as Jiji was the only who was aware that Sasuke wasn't working alone. He and Menō returned to the Institute just in time to see the last of its buildings collapse. Sasuke instructed Menō to protect the prisoners from the other dragons and rushed to the rubble of the building that Sakura would likely have been searching while slaying any dragon beasts that attempted to attack him. He started digging and activated his Sharingan in an effort to locate her chakra, but couldn't detect none. Suspecting she could have been poisoned, thus suppressing her chakra signature, Sasuke's desperation mounted and he called out to her. Sensing the chakra within the Earth Release wedding ring he crafted from her, Sasuke rescued Sakura from the debris and beganhealingher. Sasuke attacking the dragon beasts with Chidori Senbon. Although the dragons attacking Menō were smaller than him, they significantly outnumbered him and it became increasingly difficult to fend them off. Sasuke soon arrived to help, who Menō was happy to see. Sasuke instructed him to keep his distance, only attacking when he sees an opening. Under Sasuke's command, Menō was able to defeat even an adult member of his species. Jiji volunteered to deal with Sakura when she arrived, leaving Sasuke and Menō to deal with Zansūru. He commanded all the dragons to attack, but Sasuke'sChidori SenbonandFire Release: Great Fireball Techniquefend them off, scaring Zansūru. Sasuke received a messenger hawk with news of thePrime Minister's capture and Prince Nanara's ascension to king. Undeterred, Zansūru planned to continue fighting in the minister's name. After Menō lured the Titan into the lake, Zansūru focused on Sasuke, commanding the dragons to attack all at once. When he gotcloseto Zansūru, he ordered them to escape, but due to not being their summoner, the new order overwrote the previous the grab him. Zansūru fell to ground and died. Sasuke and Sakura reaffirming their bond. Retrieving the particles, he joined up with Sakura, who had restrained Jiji. Sasuke asked Jiji about why he got involved with Zansūru's plot. After learning of Jiji's background, Sasuke revealed he had been deceived, as his deceased loverMargowas actually alive. Overjoyed that she was alive, Jiji released the technique, and Sasuke thanked Menō while bidding him farewell. One of the dragons attacked Jiji before returning to the afterlife, and he mused if anything would have happened if he had been as strong as Sasuke and Sakura. Sakura and Kakashi returned to Konoha with the polar particles, allowing Naruto to be healed, and Sasuke resumed his travels."
Who was the orphaned citizen of Amegakure?,Garashi Tno,Kara actuation arc,"Main article:Kara Actuation Arc Sasuke and Sai investigating Kara in Amegakure. In the anime, after Sasuke finished probing Shojoji's mind, he learned that Kara was allegedly last seen hidden inAmegakure. Sasuke was aided by Team 25 to investigate this new shadow organisation. There, he learned that the village had decayed greatly since the last great war. After Sai's team mapped our a series of underground tunnels, Sasuke and Sai went in alone. As they entered the area, there were assaulted byGarashi Tōno, an orphaned citizen of Amegakure. He insisted that they were enemies who killed his friends. He was quickly subdued and they explained their situation. Calming down, Garashi explained how a group of people were conducting an experiment underground. Garashi agreed to take them through the tunnels. This however turned out to be a trap, as Garashi ensnared the Konoha-nin and gassed them, revealing himself to be a supporter of Kara after the struggles he had to endure since the Fourth Shinobi World War. Sasuke saw through is deception after recognising the look of shameless anger about him, using shadow clones to bait him. Before they could get information from him, Garashi was also tricked by Kara, as his gas mask was tampered with and he succumbed to the poison gas. As the tunnels began to collapse from another trap, they learned that Kara had been stationed there and was performing biological experiments. Sai and Sasuke reported their findings to Konohagakure. Afterward, with the growing threat of Kara, Sasuke feared for his disciple's safety and loaned Boruto his other glove, instructing him to keep his Kāma hidden from all at all cost. Sasuke later learned thatVictor, president of theLand of Valleys' premiere medical and research company, and was in fact a member of Kara and somehow acquired a sample of the First Hokage's cells. AfterTeam 7was defeated byDeepa, Victor's associate within Kara, Boruto and Sarada both approached Sasuke for help in growing stronger. He agreed to train Sarada, but upon learning of Boruto's desire to improve his Rasengan, Sasuke directed him to Kakashi, as Boruto didn't want to detract from his father's work and Kakashi was the only other Rasengan user in the village. Sasuke training Sarada. As Sarada began her training under Sasuke, she asked him to teach her the Chidori for its superior penetrating power. Sasuke noted Chidori is a dangerous technique that draws its strength from a fierce linear path, and as such, only a superior perception can offset the normally reduced field of vision, something that Sarada's one tomoe Sharingan couldn't handle as its natural range of vision was still too limited. Deciding to help Sarada master and improve her Sharingan, Sasuke focused her training on dodging a barrage ball bearings similar to her previous enemy's technique. He would drill her on not overly relying on the Sharingan's natural insight, but rather focus on the entire area and let the Sharingan fill in the blanks. As Sarada began improving in her movements against barrage attacks, Sasuke noted that she was still very limited on how long she could maintain the Sharingan. When he suggested improving her stamina, Sarada asked about theMangekyō Sharingan. Concerned about such a dangerous power, Sasuke insisted that such a talk was for another day. Soon, they were approached by Sakura. She was concerned that Sarada was pushing herself too hard after just recovering, and even more horrified to hear her talk about the Mangekyō Sharingan. While Sakura insisted that she couldn't push herself so recklessly, Sarada was furious to hear her mother coddle her like that, refusing to see why she wanted to get stronger, and stormed off. Alone with his wife, Sasuke admitted to worrying about the path Sarada was potentially walking, but insisted Sarada is as strong as they were back then. The following day, as Sarada continued struggling to evade all of Sasuke's barrages, Sakura approached again. She insisted that just blindly facing the challenge wouldn't yield any results. She asked Sarada to join a sparing match with her, which Sasuke agreed to as Sakura's insight could determine things he couldn't. After Sakura quickly overwhelmed Sarada, she noted that Sarada's biggest problems were her still underdeveloped chakra control and fear of defeat, which were inhibiting her development. Determined to break past her limits, Sarada faced down Sakura again, using her Sharingan to mimic the movements and general timing of Sakura's attacks to mimic Sakura's chakra-enhanced strength and reach a standstill. Sasuke was impressed by his daughter, and Sakura was now determined to help Sarada overcome her limits by joining in her training. Due to the vigorous training under her parents' tutelege, Sarada and her comrades were ultimately able to defeat Deepa during a rematch to prevent the growth of an artificalGod Tree, awakening her second tomoe in the process."
How did Sasuke and Naruto face Jigen?,"As Jigen left to retrieve Kawaki, Sasuke determined the situation to be direr than he expected and felt the need to inform Naruto at once",Kawaki arc,"Main article:Kawaki Arc Sasuke investigates a foreign dimension. In the anime, Sarada requested to be taught the Chidori, which Sasuke accepted with Sakura's approval. The following day, he walked her through the key mechanics to properly using the jutsu. As she struggled to do so, Sasuke was soon contacted by Sai with a mission that required Sasuke's unique abilities. Sasuke reluctantly had to end Sarada's training. Sasuke was later sent to investigate coordinates discovered in intel recovered by Konohamaru, a location accessible only through space–time ninjutsu. He discovered an Ōtsutsuki related site, which contained records on some of their members, specifically those who had been to their world, which also led him to believe Kaguya came to this world with a partner. There, he also discovered another Ten-Tails imprisoned. Sasuke managed to hide when Jigen arrived but was left terrified when he absorbed some of the Ten-Tails' chakra for himself, briefly taking the form of Kaguya's supposed partner. As Jigen left to retrieve Kawaki, Sasuke determined the situation to be direr than he expected and felt the need to inform Naruto at once. Sasuke and Naruto face Jigen. Jigen later attacked Konoha and sent Naruto to a different dimension. Just as he was about to leave Naruto stranded, Sasuke appeared and prevented Jigen from fleeing. Fighting at full power together, Sasuke and Naruto struggled against Jigen's perplexing powers. Sasuke eventually deduced that Jigen's abilities allow him to shrink matter to microscopic levels and return it to its original size instantaneously. Recognising Sasuke's impressive analytical skills and prowess with his dōjutsu, Jigen noted that he must eliminate Sasuke first. Before Sasuke was able to inform Naruto about the full extent of Jigen's capabities, Jigen progressed his Kāma to the next stage, his appearance reminiscent of the newly discovered Ōtsutsuki-clan member. Jigen effortlessly overpowered the two, and despite theircollaborativeefforts, Jigen managed to leathally impale Sasuke and Naruto with his chakra-draining rods. Jigen resolved to seal Naruto and moved to kill Sasuke, though was hindered by Naruto's shadow clones. Despite Sasuke's protests, Naruto convinced him to return to Konoha so that he can live to fight another day, prompting Sasuke to teleport to Sakura's side before passing out from his injuries. Sasuke was taken to the hospital where Sakura proceeded to heal him out of critical condition. After Sasuke recovered, he learned that Boruto andKawakiused theirKāmato go to the separate dimension to save Naruto, alongside the remaining members ofTeam 7. Sasuke questioned his daughter about the events. Sarada explained that Boruto not only sprouted a horn and manifested aByakugan, but was acting maliciously. After becoming concerned, Mitsuki privately informed Sasuke that Kara has taken a special interest in Boruto, calling him ""Momoshiki's Vessel"". Sasuke concluded that Momoshiki used Boruto as a means to preserve himself, and also that Kawaki is facing the same ordeal withIsshiki Ōtsutsuki. Shortly thereafter,Amado Sanzu, the head of Kara's research and development division, arrived at Konoha and negotiated the terms of his defection. Sasuke was present during Amado's interrogation, alongside Naruto and Shikamaru, where he learned that the scientist was responsible for providing Konoha with the coordinates to Kara's dimension. During the interrogation, Amado projected a live recording ofKoji Kashin's confrontation with Jigen. Sasuke protects Amado from Kawaki's attack. As they watched the fight, Amado continued divulging intel on the Ōtsutsuki, and Kāma. Sasuke noticed an inconsistency in Amado's explanation over the mechanics of Kāma, noting that Jigen still bore his marking despite having been taken over by Isshiki already. Acknowledging his point, Amado explained the unorthodox manner of Isshiki's parasitic take-over of Jigen. Upon witnessing Koji's flames engulfing Jigen's body, Naruto wondered if Isshiki's end was near, though Sasuke pointed out that Isshiki still had two vessels marked with Kāma, indicating he could reincarnate twice. Sasuke voiced his concern that killing Jigen would make Kawaki Isshiki's sole remaining vessel, prompting Shikamaru to wonder if the entire thing was a setup from the start. Kawaki entered the interrogation room and attacked Amado, but was blocked by Sasuke's sword. Amado assured everyone that it was a misunderstanding and to turn their attention back to the battle. When Jigen's death triggered Isshiki's resurrection in his body, Amado explained this also erased Kawaki's Kāma to avoid duplicates, leading Sasuke to realise that without any remaining Kāma, Isshiki was vulnerable to permanent death. After Amado was officially made a citizen of Konohagakure, he explained that Isshiki's resurrection was unstable and would seek out Kawaki again to rebrand him. Sasuke fighting Isshiki. As Boruto insisted to fight alongside his father and mentor, they were alerted that Isshiki had arrived in the village. Naruto ordered Boruto to join the evacuation before departing for battle, though Sasuke stayed behind to talk with his pupil, and once again gave Boruto his precious genin forehead protector, making Boruto swear to return it in the end. Arriving to the battlefield and saving Naruto from Isshiki's attack, Sasuke began indiscriminately launching shuriken at Isshiki, who proceeded to shrink them all. When Sasuke launched his sword at Isshiki, he was deceived as it was revealed to be Boruto, who activated Kāma and teleported Isshiki and himself to a separate dimension. Sasuke and Naruto soon joined to help Boruto via space-time ninjutsu. As the Konoha ninja faced down Isshiki, leading to Sasuke swapping places with Boruto for a sneak attack, only for Isshiki to easily rebuff him. The fight resumed, with Isshiki manifesting and manipulatingmassive black cubes, that separated Sasuke and Naruto. Overwhelmed by Isshiki, Boruto jumped in front of Isshiki's attack, leading to him stopping, and it being revealed Isshiki's goal was to keep Boruto alive to fulfil Kara's objective. As Boruto passed out from his injuries. Isshiki took advantage of Naruto's chakra connection to Kawaki through the latter's prosthetic arm, teleporting his vessel to them. As Kawaki tried to escape Isshiki's rebranding, Sasuke attempted to give a diversion via Amenotejikara anda scientifically-enhanced smokescreen. After Kawaki deceived Isshiki with a shadow clone, resulting in the Ōtsutsuki's death. Sasuke's Rinnegan is destroyed by Momoshiki. Sasuke asked Naruto about the drawbacks of hisBaryon Mode, during which Boruto suddenly stabbing his Rinnegan. Controlled by Momoshiki, he revealed that he planned to feed Kawaki to Isshiki's Ten-Tails, due the large percentage of Ōtsutsuki DNA that lingered in the vessel's body. Sasuke assisted Kawaki in fighting Momoshiki and resolved to kill Boruto if necessary. He noticed that Momoshiki had avoided absorbinganychakra-basedninjutsuwith the Kāma, and deduced that since he emerged when Boruto passed out from chakra exhaustion, replenishing Boruto's chakra could make his personality resurface. While strategising with Kawaki, Sasuke was hit by Momoshiki's Vanishing Rasengan. After Kawaki forced Momoshiki to absorb a self-sacrificial technique, Boruto was able to awaken and resist Momoshiki's control. After the exhausting confrontation, Sasuke, Boruto, and Kawaki learned that Naruto was spared at the sacrifice of Kurama's life force. With Sasuke's Rinnegan destroyed and Kawaki's Kāma extinguished, Boruto was the group's only hope to escape the foreign dimension. With Kawaki's help, Boruto was able to conjure a portal, which Sasuke pulled a weakened Naruto through. Upon returning, Sasuke and his comrades were relieved to return home victorious. In the anime, shortly after returning, Sasuke and Naruto were examined by Sakura and Katasuke, with the latter noting that Sasuke had lost a great amount of his power due to the loss of his Rinnegan. Sasuke assured Sakura that he was alright, accepting that the loss of his eye was a small sacrifice. Later, Sasuke learned that Boruto's Kāma transformation would be complete anywhere between 2 weeks to 6 months. Sympathising with Naruto, he confronted him, telling Naruto that he already made the promise to kill Boruto if the time came, insisting that Naruto must accept the reality of what could likely happen."

After Sarada and Boruto made it to the finals, they each asked Sasuke for advice. While never becoming a chūnin himself, he told both Boruto and Sarada that a shinobi must always be prepared for all challenges. During the finals, Sasuke arrived in time to watch the third match, between Sarada and Chōchō. After her victory, Sarada was happy to see her father. He commended her for her performance, and she confided in him having a better of his warning about being commited as a shinobi. He asked about Boruto and Mitsuki, noticing their absence despite still not having fought. Following the exams' completion, Sasuke looked with pride as Sarada presented to him and Sakura her new flak jacket to symbolise her promotion.

Who did Sasuke take with him when he needed a new messenger hawk?,Boruto,Labyrinth game arc,"Main article:Labyrinth Game Arc Sasuke obtains his new messenger hawk. In the anime, Sasuke took Boruto with him when he required a new messenger hawk, interested in acquiring a rare Senri Hawk. When their train had to make a detour, he and Boruto hopped off and continued on foot. They passed through an established with an unfriendly security officer. Upon arrival at the research facility with the hawk caretakerMaruta, they were initially attacked, having been mistaken for Paradise representatives. Because of Paradise's interest in the hawks, Maruta couldn't take Sasuke to their habitat, so Sasuke decided to investigate, pretending to be a customer. After witnessing their security measures and being exposed as shinobi, Sasuke and Boruto left. That night, Maruta took Sasuke to the habitat, Sasuke throwing off the security officer thatMozu Shitakiriordered to follow them with a flock of crows. Arriving at the habitat Maruta explained that the Senri Hawks have to pick their master, and was surprised when one readily perched on Sasuke's arm. Back at Maruta's facility, Boruto informed Sasuke about Tsuzura's situation. Sasuke had his own opinions about, but felt that Tsuzura had to take action on his own. When leaving the next day, they learned that a taxidermist wanted to buy Tsuzura's hawkYuki, so Sasuke followed Boruto back to Paradise. Sasuke intimidated the security officer's wolf, who was threatening Boruto and Tsuzura. He offered to exchange his new hawk for Tsuzura's, and secretly used his Sharingan on it, giving it delayed instructions how to act after he left. On his way to the train station, the security officer realised who Sasuke was, and advised Mozu not to act against him when she caught up, after Sasuke's hawk freed all her captive animals. Sasuke took Tsuzura to become Maruta's apprentice, and instructed Boruto to return to Konoha on his own, so that his interference in Paradise wouldn't reflect on it, and began his search for Kara's remaining Inner,Code. He later sent Sarada a letter informing her of his split from Boruto. His journey later took him back to the Land of Redaku."

When did Sasuke suffer a drastic change in the plot which made him become one of the series' antagonists?,"By the time Sasuke suffered a drastic change in the plot which made him become one of the series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to theyin and yangas a result of their notable differences",Creation and conception,"When developing the originalNarutomanga,Masashi Kishimotohad not initially intended to create Sasuke. After speaking with his editor about the future of the series, he was advised to create a rival character for the series' protagonist, Naruto, resulting in Sasuke's creation.[102]To learn more about creating an effective rivalry, Kishimoto read a variety of manga to gather ideas on what constituted such a rivalry, and he coalesced these ideal elements into one relationship. Because Sasuke is intended to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto is always careful to make sure Sasuke is never too emotional. With Sasuke's character being that of a ""cool genius,"" Kishimoto feels he has created the ideal rivalry.[103]By the time Sasuke suffered a drastic change in the plot which made him become one of the series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to theyin and yangas a result of their notable differences. As a result, he mentions that whenever one of the two progresses, he makes sure the other does it too.[104]In early 2014, he referred to Sasuke as a ""very pure person"" when asked whether he was good or evil, adding that while some of his actions such as following his clan's ideals are positive, he tends to bring problems to others due to his self-centred nature.[105]Since the series started serialisation, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters.[106] When first introducing Sasuke, Kishimoto had made a chapter which was set before the creation of Team 7, and Naruto had just become a ninja. However, this idea was later cancelled and Sasuke was introduced alongside Team 7, yet keeping the same traits and his rivalry with Naruto.[107]Sasuke's first name comes from the mangaSasukebySanpei Shirato, a series which Kishimoto likes, as well as fromSarutobi Sasuke, a fictional ninja featured in Japanese children's stories.[108]Kishimoto remarks that Sasuke's character was influenced byHieifromYu Yu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when making his character and his Sharingan.[109] Sasuke's design gave Kishimoto a number of problems, making him the most difficult character he had to create. Because he lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face should look like, initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character the same age as Naruto.[110]Once settling on a proper face, Kishimoto worked on Sasuke's attire. Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs, a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realising he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.[111] For Kishimoto, Sasuke remains the most difficult character for him to draw. While drawing, errors and mishaps commonly result in Sasuke's youthful appearance being lost, a result of Kishimoto's inexperience in drawing characters mature beyond their years.[111]Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, has slowly gotten longer as the series has progressed, increasing the amount of time needed to draw Sasuke.[110]Midway through Part I of the series Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke that featured a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs. Because of the time needed to draw a costume of this design, Kishimoto returned Sasuke to his original costume.[112]Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, Sasuke has become his favourite character to draw.[111] When designing Sasuke in his Part II appearance, Kishimoto's main objective was to make him look cool. For this, he tried giving him several outfits such asShimenawaaround him to preserve Orochimaru's style of clothing as by the moment in the series he was his apprentice. He also tried other clothes such as a turtleneck and a military uniform to show ""cleanliness"". However, he ended up choosing Japanese-style clothes with achokutō-style sword.[113]"
What did Ino Yamanaka do to Sakura?,defended Sakura from her bullies,Background,"Sakura as an Academy student. Sakura is the only child of Kizashi and Mebuki Haruno. She had a healthy childhood, raised by her parents without any serious tragedy or complications, unlike her team members. When she entered Konoha'sAcademy, a few of the girls in her class started picking on her because of her broad forehead. Sakura tried to combat their teasing by hiding her forehead with her bangs, but this caused the girls to bully her even more.Ino Yamanaka, one of her classmates, saw this, and defended Sakura from her bullies and encouraged her to embrace her forehead rather than hide it. Over the following years, Ino's guidance and friendship helped Sakura become comfortable with herself and develop into her own person. Though she felt indebted to Ino for helping her, Sakura began to feel that she was living in Ino's shadow when she, instead, wanted to be Ino's equal. At some point after she entered in the Academy, Sakura metSasuke Uchihaand she developed a crush on him. When she told her friends, she was surprised to learn how popular Sasuke was with the girls. Sakura heard a rumour of Sasuke being attracted to girls with long hair and she began letting her hair grow to get his attention. A couple of years later, when she learned Ino had a crush on Sasuke and no longer wanting to be in Ino's shadow, Sakura ended their friendship so that they could compete for Sasuke's love, thus beginning a bitter rivalry between them and their dislike towards each other. After they were placed in their teams, Sakura approached Ino, bragging about being on Sasuke's team and declaring she won't lose.[10]"
What is Sakura's motivation to get stronger?,to overcome the Mind Body Switch Technique,Personality,"Inner Sakura. As a child, Sakura was insecure and highly self-conscious about her large forehead, covering it with her bangs. It was not until she met Ino, who defended her from bullies and became her friend, that she become more self-confident. At the start of Part I, Sakura typically gives the outward impression of being polite to her superiors, considerate of her peers, and confident in herself. She has occasional moments of bashfulness around Sasuke and competitiveness around Ino, but otherwise appears quite collected. This reservation, though never disingenuous, frequently masks how Sakura feels: in certain situations, she has pronounced feelings of frustration and anger. Rather than display these emotions to others, she projects them inward, allowing a manifestation of who she truly is — what is labelled ""Inner Sakura"" — to have the opinions Sakura wants to keep to herself.Inner Sakura, whose appearances are marked by an exclamation of ""Shannarō!"", is in a sense a personality separate from Sakura herself, a fact that allows her to overcome theMind Body Switch Technique.[11]At other times, Sakura and Inner Sakura are indistinguishable from each other, usually with regards to Naruto. If Naruto says or does something that annoys or upsets her, Sakura responds with violence, a reaction that under other circumstances would be delegated to Inner Sakura. Sakura's motivation to get stronger. As Part I progresses, Sakura becomes increasingly exposed to the realities of the shinobi world, difficulties for which she cannot rely upon Inner Sakura to cope with alone. When she was an Academy student, Sakura succeeded through studying alone to the point of pride. As ashinobi, however, this is proven insufficient as missions cannot be truly completed merely with book smarts, and it is necessary to be able to fight so that other shinobi will not kill her or her teammates. The latter makes Sakura particularly disappointed in herself, as she is unable to contribute much in battle and must rely on Naruto and Sasuke to save her. She sets out to change this about herself, dedicating nearly three years of training to making herself as capable as Naruto and Sasuke; in the meantime, she becomes willing to sacrifice herself to protect them, coming to value them both very deeply.[12]She looks to Naruto as a model for this goal, inspired by his rapid growth and his determination to be there for her and all those he held dear. When Sakura realises that she is as rude to Naruto as Sasuke usually is to her at his urging, she starts treating him better, cheering for his accomplishments, and confiding her hopes and fears with him. Inner Sakura makes one appearance at the very start of Part II and then is never seen in the series again.[13]This is because Sakura is finally in touch with her feelings and is willing to express what she's thinking, a self-comfort she picked up during her training with Tsunade. However, this has also made her more emotional and impulsive at times. Her desire to catch up in strength with Naruto and Sasuke, her protectiveness of them, and her need to prove her worthiness as a ninja, brings forth this dark side of her more easily which often leads her to attack her opponents and get rescued by her teammates.[14]Minato, at one point, witnessing Sakura's outburst on Naruto when he asked if she was his girlfriend, noted that she reminded him of his ownwife.[15]However, Sakura no longer thinks poorly of Naruto, but nevertheless expresses her anger and displeasure with him whenever Naruto's immaturity and idiotic traits surface, often lashing out with violence, demonstrating a very obdurate and stiff-necked nature. Regardless, Sakura has deep respect and trust towards Naruto's skills as a ninja, angrily reprimanding and threateningSaiwhen he, although deliberately to test Sakura's faith in Naruto, deemed Naruto weak. Yet, she is ever-worrying for his safety and well-being to the point of easily feeling overwhelming guilt, and values him as one of her closest friends. Sai eventually points out that he believes Naruto knows Sakura too well for his own good, constantly placing himself in personal peril out of his feelings for her so that Sakura will be happy. Sakura is moved to tears by this, feeling unbearably guilty for what she feels she had put Naruto through. Despite her attempts to take responsibility for herself during the Summit by trying to deal with Sasuke herself, she still finds herself relying on him due to her shaky resolve, nearly costing Sakura her life. She ultimately settles for doing whatever she can for him, trying to do more in supporting him and his decisions concerning Sasuke, trying to do more to help him bear the challenges of being ajinchūrikiand fighting at his side whenever possible. She is helped in this goal by Tsunade's influence, who trained her to have a contempt for losing and an unbending will;[16]she will place herself at risk so that others don't need to and to assure her allies' victory.[17] Sakura's perverted side. Despite Sakura violently reprimanding not only Naruto, but occasionallyKonohamaru Sarutobifor their perverted tendencies, Sakura herself has a perverted side which she often keeps hidden. When Konohamaru showcased hisSexy: Girl on Girl Technique, Sakura displayed her disgust at the technique, but Konohamaru quickly countered by quickly creating theSexy: Boy on Boy Techniqueto spite her, and instead of admonishing Konohamaru for it, Sakura was immediately drawn to the technique, responding with a pleasured screech upon seeing the technique, with the two cloned individuals resembling Sai and Sasuke. However, Sakura is embarassed of her own perverted nature, and upon realising her reaction was noticed byTeam 7, she quickly tried to make an excuse, but Konohamaru's suspicions that Sakura is just as much a pervert as he and Naruto are is all but confirmed.[18] Sakura has been in love with Sasuke since childhood and initially focuses on getting his attention above everything else. Her initial infatuation for him was rooted in his good looks, and calm, collecting attitude, and his rejections failed to deter her. Despite being grateful of her loving him after she confesses to stop him from defecting from Konoha, Sasuke rejects her but thanks her before leaving.[19]This rejection deeply upsets Sakura, driving her to plea for Naruto to bring Sasuke home and, when Naruto fails, motivating her to become stronger so that she can bring Sasuke back herself.[20]She tries to separate herself from her feelings when Sasuke becomes an international criminal, attempting to kill him to prevent a war,[21]but her love for him proved to be too great for her to harm him.[22]Even at the end of theFourth Shinobi World War, Sakura holds out hope that she may mean something to him.[23]Despite Sasuke's crimes, Sakura was able to forgive him after he sincerely apologised to her for how much he hurt her. She was also surprised when he exhibited a much softer point with her and began poking her on the forehead, an affectionate gesture he picked up from hisbrother.[24] After marrying Sasuke, Sakura became very loyal to him and even refused to leave his side while she was pregnant with their daughter,Sarada. Sakura raises Sarada on her own due to Sasuke being away on his mission for many years, and she frequently reassures Sarada that Sasuke loves them both and will return home once his mission is over. She is also very patient and wise as her love and patience for Sasuke never faded even though Sarada was barely a toddler when he left. Although Sakura is very supportive of Sasuke's duties, she is disappointed when he teases her by refusing to show her affection. Likewise, even after years married, Sakura remains as smitten with Sasuke's good looks as ever.[25]As a mother, Sakura is loving and protective, and has a very close relationship with her daughter and will praise her for her achievements just as quickly as she admonishes her for wrongdoing."
"Where does Sakura wear a red top with a shuriken holster around her right thigh, blue sandals, and the standard Konohaforehead protectorworn as a hairband?",Part I,Appearance,"Sakura has fair skin, green eyes, and pink hair. In her youth, she wore her hair as bangs in order to cover her large forehead and fend off her classmates' calling her ""Forehead Girl"" . Ino encouraged her not to do this and wear her hair back instead, so that others could see her face. Later in her Academy career she let her hair get longer because of rumours that Sasuke was attracted to girls with long hair.[10]During Part I, when she realises that long hair is a vulnerability in combat situations, she cuts her hair and keeps it under shoulder-length from that point onward, which she sometimes pins up in a ponytail while working.[26]As Sakura gets older, she is noted to become quite attractive, withJiraiyalikening her looks to Tsunade's own. In Part I, Sakura wears a redqipaodress — at various times either with or without short sleeves — with slits along the sides accompanied by a zipper and white circular designs. She also wears tight dark green bike shorts with a shuriken holster around her right thigh, blue sandals, and the standard Konohaforehead protectorworn as a hairband. Colour illustrations from the manga tend to depict her using nail polish and eye-shadow in Part I, both of which are not present in the anime. In Part II, Sakura's typical outfit consists of a red top with the same design as the upper-half of her Part I outfit. Accompanying this are black gloves, low-heel, knee-high boots, black shorts underneath a short grey apron skirt, and grey elbow protectors . The cloth of her forehead protector is changed to red and she starts carrying a medical pouch. Sakura wears the standard Konoha infantryflak jacketand assorted clothing during theFourth Shinobi World War. She also gains theStrength of a Hundred Seal— in the shape of a violet rhombus — on her forehead, which remains visible thereafter. Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Sakura wears a sleeveless red qipao dress that reaches her upper thighs, with white trimmings and a white circular design on the back similar to her Part I attire; it is tied with a black obi. She wears black shorts underneath the dress, black gloves, and pink elbow and knee protectors. She has also changed her previous boots to regular black, high heeled ninja sandals. In adulthood, Sakura's attire consists of a red sleeveless qipao top that exposes her navel, the back of which carries theUchiha clancrest and falls to her knees. She also wears light-coloured pants, high heels and a red headband. For battle, Sakura wears a red top similar to her Part II one, with the Uchiha clan crest on the back, elbow protectors and flatter sandals. At home, she often dons a long white apron and keeps her fingernails long and well-manicured. She also wears white bracelets on both her wrists."
How long did Sakura's training with Tsunade last?,two-and-a-half years,Abilities,"Sakura defeating dozens of Ten-Tails clones. As a genin, due to her focus on her studies, Sakura lacked any particular combat skill, other than the basic skills she learned in the Academy. This greatly limited her role in missions, to the point where she frequently noted how much she relied on her teammates, Sasuke and Naruto. On one occasion, she is even stated by Shikamaru to be: ""A kunoichi with no particular talent"". Determined to change herself, she undergoes intense training withTsunadefor two-and-a-half years. From her display of skill in the earlier portions of Part II, others have remarked that Sakura would likely surpass Tsunade.[27][28]Upon completing theStrength of a Hundred Sealduring theFourth Shinobi World War, she's finally caught up to her team-mates at the time.[5]Two years later, she rises to the rank ofjōnin,[29]and was capable of single-handily defeatingKido Tsumikidespite theAnbubeing empowered by aTailed Beast Drug.[30]As an adult,Borutoremarked that she was a suitable replacement for Naruto asHokage.[31]"
How did Sakura's taijutsu improve to the point that she could easily destroy a number of Sasori's puppets?,After Tsunade's training,Chakra control and physical prowess,"While Sakura has rarely been seen usingtaijutsuin Part I, she was able to hold her own against Ino, one of the top students in her class.[32][33]After Tsunade's training, Sakura's taijutsu improved to the point that she could easily destroy a number of Sasori's puppets.[34]As an adult, she could go toe to toe with aMangekyō Sharinganwielding opponent likeShin Uchiha.[35] As seen in Part I, Sakura's most defining skill was her proficiency inchakracontrol.[36]Even as a genin, Sakura could greatly augment her speed by sending chakra to her feet, impressing both Naruto and Rock Lee.[37]Such exact use of her chakra allows her to perform ajutsuwith maximum efficiency without wasting much chakra, whichKakashi Hatakenoted had already surpassed evenSasuke's.[38]Kakashi also once noted that her aptitude is well-suited forgenjutsu. While never actually seen using genjutsu, due to her affinity for it and her proficiency in chakra control, Kakashi taught her a method to deal with being caught in genjutsu that involves abruptly stopping the flow of chakra.[39]She's frequently been shown to quickly identify when genjutsu is being used,[40]and release herself or others from it.[41]By adulthood, genjutsu had little to no effect on her and she is able to break out of even some of the strongest ones with ease.[29] Training under Tsunade for over two years refined her already impressive chakra control, becoming a vital part to many of her abilities. By rapidly building up chakra and concentrating it into her fists or other body parts, it grants her what is commonly referred to as""monstrousstrength"".[27][42]After completing theStrength of a Hundred Seal, her attacks become strong enough to destroy buildings or upend the earth, increasing with greater input of chakra.[43]She could even damageKaguya Ōtsutsukiwith a single blow, breaking off one of her horns.[44]She can also use this increase in strength to lift great mass or free herself from formidable constraints.[45][46]These feats have led toHashiramapraising her as having greater raw power than even Tsunade.[47] Sakura can use the chakra built up in her hands to catch and repel incoming ninjutsu.[48]Likewise, after anticipating an attack, she can send chakra throughout her entire body to nullify the damage of normally lethal blows.[49] Sakura releasing her Strength of a Hundred Seal. Another goal of Tsunade's training was to increase Sakura's available chakra supply via completing theStrength of a Hundred Seal, which is something that took three years to accomplish.[47]In the anime, Tsunade explained that building up the seal substantially drains one of their chakra, making it dangerous to perform surgery or fight, but Sakura developed a way to divert a small portion of that built-up chakra back into her normal reserves.[50]When the seal isreleased, Sakura has access to all the accumulated chakra, and since she doesn't need to waste any of it onmaintaininga youthful appearance like Tsunade does, she's able to perform techniques on a much greater scale than she's normally able to.[51][52]She can also transfer this chakra to others.[53] Sakura's unique mastery of chakra manipulation has improved enough to roughlymap outentire structures by channelling her chakra through inorganic materials. Doing so allows her to detect threats, traps, and hidden rooms.[54]"
How did Sakura heal the most fatal injuries?,With the weapon still lodged within her,Ninjutsu,"Sakura and Katsuyu heal the tired and injured. By the Fourth Shinobi World War, Sakura could use theSummoning Technique, and like Tsunade, summon the giantslug,Katsuyu. Noted to be incredibly impressive by Shizune, Sakura could have Katsuyusplit apartand attach itself to others, Sakura could thenremotelymonitor many allies at once, healing and replenishing their chakra as needed.[55]Sakura could also useEarth,Water,Yin, andYang Release.[5]By adulthood, she acquiredFire Releaseas well.[56]Sakura has also become skilled in the use offūinjutsu. Upon contact, she can skilfully implant a cherry blossom-shaped seal on a target. On command, these seals releasered chakra threadsthat completely restrict body movement.[57] Sakura extracting poison. The major purpose of Tsunade's training was to teach Sakuramedical ninjutsu, which demanded Sakura's refined chakra control and intelligence. Tsunade remarks that her proficiency for healing is exceptionally rare.[58]As such, Sakura canhealeven the most fatal of injuries.[59]Even when heavily injured, Sakura demonstrated the ability to quickly heal herself to halt further blood loss, managing to do so with the weapon still lodged within her.[60][61]When dealing with an enemy with an extremely resistant body, she could combine her chakra-enhanced fists with her medical ninjutsu to heal the resulting damage from her strikes, eventually killing the affected cells from over-replication.[62]By releasing the Strength of a Hundred Seal, Sakura can put her body in astatein which itheals itselfso that she doesn't need to stop to treat herself or even be fazed by injury.[63]In the anime, she could perform ahighly difficult operationalone to regenerate a missing section of a person's body.[64] Sakura manually pumping Naruto's heart. If healing proves ineffective, Sakura can makeincisionsin her patients to try and directly treat her patients' vital organs.[65]She can also cure those who have been poisoned byextractingthe poison from their bodies, while simultaneously repairing the damage — something which even poison-experts likeChiyocannot do. To ensure a complete recovery, Sakura can create an effective antidote after analysing the poison's contents, even for poisons thatSasoridid not believe anyone but himself could make antidotes for.[66]After Kurama was removed from Naruto, during the war, Sakura was able to prevent Naruto's death by manually making his heart pump, as well as manually carrying out respiration via mouth to mouth resuscitation until they were able to reach Minato and eventually saved him. Two years after the war, she again saved Naruto from chakra deprivation, by pouring her own chakra into him and Kurama, which took her three days. Her medical expertise extends to more standard medicine as well, enabling her to perform autopsies and examine cells with a knowledge of genetics.[67]She was taught by Tsunade how to blend powerful fast-acting sleeping gas,[68]and was taught by Shizune on how to concoct poisons that, when coated on weapons, could debilitate or paralyse a person with a single scratch.[69]In the anime, Sakura even created her own version of Military Rations Pills, intended to have more medicinal purposes and be easier to consume. By the time ofBoruto: Naruto Next Generations, she had also learned the Healing Power Alteration Technique , although it is unknown what this entails.[70]After Naruto became Hokage, Sakura's skill with medical ninjutsu had been recognised to the point he made her the head of the medical department."
How did Sakura's intelligence help Naruto and Sasuke?,"she was added to Team 7so that she could benefit from the more battle-oriented Naruto and Sasuke, while in turn, they would benefit from her knowledge",Intelligence,"Sakura completes the Chūnin Exams' written test without the need of cheating.

She was able to answer the written portion of theChūnin Examsall by herself without needing to cheat, something thatgeninwere not expected to be able to do.[72]Sakura's intelligence is nevertheless consistently useful, making her observational enough to guess an opponent's tactics from a brief scan of the battlefield and pick up on otherwise minor inconsistencies in conversation.[27][73]She was able to quickly and accurately deduceTobi'sunique abilitiesupon their brief encounter.[74]Sasuke deemed her analytical skills to be superior to hisSharingan,[40]and as such, developed remarkable memory and observational skills. In her battle against Sasori, a few observations were enough to learn the latter's attack patterns.[75]She is also capable of immediately memorising large amounts of information, including minute details.[76] She has an excellent memory, able to quickly piece together multiple pieces of information she's previously come across in order to form a hypothesis.[77]In actual combat, Sakura frequently relies on misleading her opponents, either by letting them think they've outsmarted her so that they lower their guard,[78]or letting them think they've defeated her so that they will approach her, and she can defeat them with a single punch.[73]"
Who is Sakura's teammate?,Sasuke Uchihais,Prologue — land of waves,"Main article:Prologue — Land of Waves Team 7's group photo. Upon graduating from theAcademyand being assigned toTeam 7, Sakura is initially devastated when she learns thatNaruto Uzumakiis to be one of her teammates. She then is immediately afterwards ecstatic to learn thatSasuke Uchihais to be her other teammate. She tries to bond with Sasuke by stating her envy of Naruto's lack of parents, but this only offends Sasuke, who tells her that she is annoying. Sakura is hurt and, on realising that she says similar things to Naruto, decides to try to be nicer to him. Team 7's leader,Kakashi Hatake, tests their qualifications with abell test, stating that whichever of the three takes one of the two bells on his person will officially becomegenin. While Naruto busies himself attacking Kakashi, Sakura seeks out Sasuke to see if she can help him. Kakashi finds her during her search and defeats her with anillusion of Sasuke dying. Likewise, Naruto and Sasuke are also defeated. Kakashi explains afterwards that the goal of the test was to use teamwork, to do together what none of them could do by themselves. He is persuaded to allow them to try again after lunch, but instructs Sasuke and Sakura not to feed Naruto. Sasuke feeds him anyway, needing him in top-form if they're to work together, and Sakura does the same. Kakashi sees this and, because they care more about the team than listening to his instructions, allows them all to pass. Team 7 protecting Tazuna. After a series of uneventfulD-rankmissions, Naruto is able to secure aC-rankmission for Team 7: escortingTazunato theLand of Waves. Soon after leaving Konoha they are attacked by theDemon Brothers, who go after Tazuna. Sakura immediately places herself in front of Tazuna to protect him and stands her ground until Kakashi captures the brothers. Tazuna confesses that assassins have been hired to kill him but that he couldn't afford the bodyguard detail he needs. Although the mission is nowA-rankin nature — far beyond the skill of genin — Team 7 decides to continue with it. When they reach the Land of Waves and are attacked byZabuza Momochi, Sakura once again protects Tazuna while Kakashi, and later Naruto and Sasuke, fight Zabuza. Zabuza is ultimately seemingly killed byHaku, allowing Team 7 to escort Tazuna back to his house. Kakashi finds Zabuza's death suspicious and decides to train the team in case he returns. He has them perform theTree Climbing Practiceto improve their chakra control, which will help them against Zabuza. Sakura masters the exercise on her first try, thus leaving her in charge of protecting Tazuna while Naruto and Sasuke train and Kakashi recovers from his fight with Zabuza. After a week, the rest of the team joins her, but when they reach the bridge that Tazuna has been working on they find Zabuza and Haku waiting for them. Sasuke and later Naruto fight Haku while Kakashi fights Zabuza, once again leaving Sakura in charge of protecting Tazuna. Thethick mistprevents her from seeing how the fight against Haku is going, so she is surprised when Haku suddenly interferes in Kakashi's fight with Zabuza and is killed. Sakura cries for Sasuke. When Naruto comes looking for Haku, Sakura asks him where Sasuke is. When Naruto refuses to respond, Sakura becomes worried, but stays put because she cannot leave Tazuna's side. When Tazuna offers to come with her, she quickly leads him to where Sasuke is and finds him seemingly dead. Overcome with emotion, Sakura knowingly violates theshinobi rulesand cries for him. When Sasuke later wakes up, Sakura embraces him, explains that Haku has been killed, and shares the news of Sasuke's survival with Naruto. Zabuza also dies, allowing Team 7 to return to Konoha when their injuries heal via Tazuna's newly-constructedGreat Naruto Bridge."
What does Sakura try to forfeit the written exam for Naruto's sake?,"his eyelashes, hair style, and thick eyebrows",Chūnin exams,"Main article:Chūnin ExamsTeam 7 resumes its series of unremarkable missions. After returning from one mission, Sakura tries to spend some time with Sasuke, who rejects her. This places Sakura in a bad mood, causing her to lash out first at Naruto when he suggests toKonohamaru Sarutobithat he and Sakura are dating, and then at Konohamaru when he insults her for harming Naruto. This all attracts the attention ofSunagakure'sThree Sand Siblings, who have come to Konoha to take part in theChūnin Exams. Sasuke returns and drives the Sand Siblings off, and later Kakashi meets with them to enter them in the Chūnin Exams as well. He neglects to mention that they must enter as a team, worried that Sakura might only participate because of Sasuke, and so is glad when she independently decides to participate. Before the Chūnin Exams begin, Sakura is met byRock Lee, who asks her to go out with him and offers to protect her with his life. Sakura flatly refuses, being bothered by his eyelashes, hair style, and thick eyebrows. Sakura tries to forfeit the written exam for Naruto's sake. For the Chūnin Exams' first stage, the participating genin are given a written test with ten questions. From looking over the questions, Sakura realises that the questions are too complicated for most genin, especially Naruto, to be able to answer without cheating; Sakura herself is able to answer the first nine questions on her own. Before being given the tenth question, genin are warned that if they answer it incorrectly they will never be allowed to take the Chūnin Exams again. Sakura becomes worried that Naruto is too proud to not try to answer the question, and that when he inevitably gives the wrong answer his disqualification will ruin his dreams of becomingHokage. She prepares to forfeit on his behalf, but Naruto insists on answering the tenth question no matter what, causing her to change her mind. For their willingness to face the tenth question despite the potential consequences, Team 7 and the remaining genin pass to the second stage. For the second stage, teams enter theForest of Deathfor a five day survival challenge. Shortly after the second stage begins, Team 7 is attacked byOrochimaru, who Sasuke and Sakura, sensing hiskilling intent, realise is far too strong for them to fight. Sasuke tries to surrender in exchange for their lives, but Naruto insists on fighting Orochimaru anyway. Both Sasuke and Sakura are surprised by how well Naruto does, though he is ultimately defeated and knocked unconscious. Sakura pins him to a tree with a kunai to stop him from falling and observes to Sasuke that Naruto, despite all his shortcomings, isn't a coward. This convinces Sasuke to fight Orochimaru as well; Orochimaru becomes impressed by Sasuke and, before he leaves, he brands Sasuke with aCursed Seal of Heaven, rendering him unconscious as well. Sakura cuts her hair. Sakura moves Naruto and Sasuke to a secluded area where she watches over them through the night. In the morning, they are tracked down byTeam Dosu, Orochimaru's underlings who have instructions to kill Sasuke. They bypass the booby-traps she laid earlier and move in on her, but she is saved by Rock Lee. Lee fights Team Dosu by himself, planning to make good on his earlier promise to protect her, but is eventually defeated. Sakura begins attacking Team Dosu herself, but she is restrained byKin Tsuchi, who grabs her by the hair and berates her for how much time she clearly spends on it. Determined to not keep needing the help of others, and motivated by Naruto and Sasuke, Sakura cuts her hair to free herself and starts attacking, persevering despiteZaku Abumi's many counterattacks. Sakura stops Sasuke. Sakura's courage convinces the observingIno Yamanakaand the rest ofTeam 10to come to her defence. Team 10 fights Team Dosu until they are interrupted by Sasuke, imbued with the power of his cursed seal. When he sees Sakura's injuries, Sasuke breaks Zaku's arms in punishment and threatens to do the same to the rest of his team. Sakura is horrified by his actions and embraces him, begging him to stop. Sasuke's cursed seal recedes and he complies, Team Dosu retreats, and Teams 7, 10, and Lee'sTeam Guyregroup. When Naruto wakes up he makes fun of Lee's eyebrows, prompting Sakura to strike him. Before they go their separate ways, Lee vows to Sakura that he will become stronger. Sakura and Ino knock each other out. Team 7 spends several days recuperating from their ordeal but they are able to reach the centre of the forest in time to advance to the Chūnin Exams' preliminaries: a series of one-on-one qualifying matches. Sakura tries to convince Sasuke not to participate because of his cursed seal, but he ignores her, insisting that it's his business and not hers. For her match, Sakura is paired against Ino. They start by trading insults and then punches, surprising Ino because Sakura proves her equal in both categories. Frustrated, Ino follows Sakura's earlier example by cutting her hair, a ruse that allows her to immobilise Sakura while she uses herMind Body Switch Technique. In control of Sakura's body, Ino tries to make her forfeit the match, but she is stopped and exorcised by Inner Sakura. They are both exhausted by this, due to both having used up all their chakra, but exchange one final blow, knocking both out. When Sakura wakes up, Ino informs her that their match was ruled a tie, and that therefore neither of them will continue to the final rounds. Despite this, they decide to rekindle their friendship, though can't help but continue to bicker over Sasuke. Sakura watches the remaining matches, including Lee's match withGaara, during which Lee loses and is badly injured. A few days later, Sakura visits the hospital to see Sasuke, but discovers he's already been taken away by Kakashi. While she's there, she sees Lee training despite his injuries, causing him to fall unconscious as a consequence; she leaves the flower she brought for Sasuke with him instead.

When Sasuke remains determined to go, Sakura tells him she loves him and offers to go with him. Sasuke tells her that she is annoying, just as he did after Team 7's formation.

Touched, Sakura apologises to Naruto for what he's gone through and promises to personally help him bring Sasuke back next time."

In order to help them deal with this, Sakura andIno Yamanakaopened a clinic within theKonoha Hospitalthat would assess and treat children's mental health. The programme proves very successful, in part because Sakura works tirelessly to make it so, a dedication that worries her friends.

Hoping to keep Sasuke's apparent plans a secret, Gaara asks Sakura to personally inform Kakashi of the plot against Konoha. Sakura and Ino do so as soon as they return to Konoha, and Kakashi shares their belief that it is an impostor. When, several days later, rumours of this impostor's actions start to spread, Kakashi sends a message Sasuke to ask if he knows anything about it, though Sasuke doesn't reply. Sakura becomes concerned about this and confides in Naruto, who hypothesises that Sasuke finds the rumours too ludicrous to give them any attention. Naruto's words put Sakura at ease. She meets with Tsunade to discuss possible ways of mimicking another person's chakra signature, and comes up with a theory of somebody extracting Sasuke's chakra from his skin and hair samples that have been gathered in large amounts.

When she's ready, Sakura breaks out of the basement, through the floors above, and finally the roof with a singleCherry Blossom Impact. Outside, she meets Sai and Ino and teams up with them against Kido and his men. Sakura is drawn into a fight with the Sasuke impostor, who chokes her using his one of Kido's synthetictailed beastcloaks. Sakura breaks free and, as she beats him unconscious, warns him to never impersonate Sasuke again. She regroups with her teammates and decide to find the rest of Kido's henchmen, but find them defeated by fire and genjutsu, and they realise this is Sasuke's doing and he had just disappeared.

What is Sakura's profession?,prison doctor,Sasuke retsuden arc,"Main articles:Sasuke Retsuden,Sasuke Retsuden andSasuke Retsuden ArcNOTE:In the anime, the events of this arc occur before theAcademy Entrance Arc.When Naruto became afflicted with an unknown illness, Sasuke went to theLand of Redakuafter learning stories that the Sage of Six Paths suffered from the same illness and found a cure there. When Kakashi learned additional information, he sent Sakura to help Sasuke after he was unable to update him through messenger hawk. Sakura infiltrated theAstronomy Research Instituteas a prison doctor to contact Sasuke, becoming popular with the inmates for her beauty and kindness. She discovered Sasuke after he foughtMenōand treated his poisoned wound, collecting a sample for testing. Sakura updated Sasuke on Kakashi's discovery aboutpolar particlesbeing the cure, and how the Sage hid two portions in ""the sky that fell to the Earth"" and ""the star that never strays"", and that to find them, one must ""revel with the map of the heavens"". She theorised that Naruto's illness is due to being a jinchūriki. Sasuke urged her to leave over the unusual dangers of the mission, but she was determined to support him. He hid himself withJijiarrived to treat his burst blisters, but revealed himself when Jiji flirted with Sakura. Sakura claimed that she took the job to get closer to her husband, as the prison didn't allow visitors. Jiji believed them, and Sakura helped Sasuke get back to his cell, later pointing him to a prison that could further their investigation. Sakura and Sasuke investigate the book's artwork. Discovering thatPenjira, a prisoner who worked as a library attendant, might know something, Sakura approached him, claiming an interest in astronomy. He determined the book she wanted was in a secure section in the basement. Appealing to his love of gambling, Sakura played cards with him. She refused Sasuke's offer to help by casting genjutsu, and memorising the wear of the cards to always draw, got him to give her the key. That night, Sasuke slipped a ring he made with Earth Release so others wouldn't flirt with her, Sakura fawning over it. Searching the books, they discovered an art style similar to Sai's, not native to the country. The art seemed to be the basis of the card game she played with Penjira, and revealed a connection to constellations, an old note also having a Konoha emblem. Sasuke trusted her decrypt the code, and days later, she slipped him the decrypted code representing dates, and asked him to meet her. Meeting with Sasuke, he revealed his discovery that the Hoshinarabe game was based off the history of the Sage of Six Paths and the Tailed Beasts. Sakura explained that a messenger from the capital was arriving to meet with Zansūru. Sakura knocked him out and disguised herself as him, while Sasuke transformed into his staff. As Sakura conversed with Zansūru in his office, Sasuke snuck away through Zansūru's back door. Sakura and Sasuke incapacitate Fundaru. Later while talking withGanno, who realised that Sasuke was her husband, Sakura realised the card game was also based off the 12 signs of Ninjutsu and that its strongest hand was the key to decode the Map of the Heavens. She quickly rushed to tell Sasuke over findings. In turn, Sasuke revealed where they could find the ""Sky that fell to Earth"" half of the meteor. As the two found the site, Sasuke offhandedly asked Sakura if she would like an authentic wedding ring, Sakura politely declined. Sasuke admitted to Sakura his regret in not being around more over the years since marrying each other. Sakura assured him their bond was undeniable. As Sakura took out the playing cards to decipher the seal, Sasuke noted the back of the cards had a lizard on a rock. Sakura noted how long ago there were dragonic creatures that went extinct after a meteor crashed on the planet. Sakura is subdued by Jiji. As Sakura performed the hand seals to reveal the polar particles, Sasuke realised the truth behindZansūru's plan. Suddenly several ancient dragons took to the sky, which Sasuke deduced were summoned by the Impure World Reincarnation Technique. Sakura headed back to the institute at Sasuke's instruction, taking the particles with her. After Sakura aided many of the inmates to safety, she found Jiji. She asked Jiji where Zansūru was, who insisted he was in the courtyard. Suddenly, Jiji stabbed Sakura with a poisoned kunai, revealing himself to be in league with Zansūru. As Sakura collapsed, he took the particles, explaining that other goal in the excavation was to find the particles as it was difficult to revive multiple dragons without them. He proceeded to use the particles to revive a giant dragon beast. Sakura leading the dragon beasts away. Sakura woke up beneath the debris and realised she couldn't properly infuse her chakra due to Jiji's poison, therefore making her unable to use her superhuman strength to escape. She began tearing up and thought of Sasuke during her supposed final moments. When she regained consciousness, however, Sakura found out she was saved by Sasuke, who explained that he located her thanks to the chakra flowing within his Earth Release wedding ring she was given. They split up as Sakura focused on saving the inmates while Sasuke and Menō battled the dragon beasts. Sakura also led many of the dragon beasts away in one direction before defeating several of them by crushing the ground beneath them with her superhuman strength. After making an exit for the inmates, Sakura's path was blocked by Jiji, who used anEarth-Style Wallto prevent her from escaping. Sakura suddenly collapsed, with Jiji explaining that his poison had a side-effect of causing paralysis. When Jiji started to walk towards her, however, he found that his feet would not move. On inspection, he noticed a trap buried in the earth that Sakura evidently placed for him. On even closer inspection, he saw that the trap connected to a seal on his wrist. Jiji couldn't understand where the seal would have come from, so Sakura explained that she placed it on him the first time he visited the infirmary: she immediately noticed that he had too much chakra to be a normal prisoner, so placed the seal as a precaution. As Jiji explained his motives for helping Zansūru, wanting to resurrect his supposedly-deceased fiancéeMargo, Sakura admitted that although she might also have been tempted to help Zansūru in his position, she disapproved of the entire plan, as she firmly believed that Margo wouldn't want to be resurrected like that. Sasuke recognised the name and showed Jiji a letter from Kakashi Hatake, which details how Redaku'sPrime Ministerwas overthrown byPrince Nanara, with some help from Margo. Jiji started to cry at the realisation that Zansūru manipulated him. After performing the hand seals to release the reincarnation technique, Sakura was attacked by one of the dragon beasts that was slowly disintegrating, but Jiji jumped in front of her to take the attack, leaving him in critical condition. As Jiji struggled with his injuries, Sakura desperately attempted to heal him, saying that he couldn't die now that he learned Margo was alive and urged him to stay alive for Margo's sake, and Sakura ultimately managed to prevent Jiji from dying. Sakura and Sasuke reaffirming their bond. After the mission ended, Sakura returned to Konoha and went out for drinks with Ino as they hadn't seen each other for a while due to Sakura's long stay at the Land of Redaku. Ino noticed Sakura's ring and inquired her about it, who didn't elaborate it beyond saying Sasuke made it with Earth Release. Later that night, Sakura looked up to the moon, and claimed that although she didn't know where Sasuke was, she, as well as Sasuke, didn't worry about their bond growing weaker, knowing that they would forever love each other."

Meanwhile, Boruto and Sarada left the village without authorisation to find Mitsuki. While Hinata was worried about the consequences of their children's actions, Sakura insisted that they knew what their actions could lead to but still had faith they would be okay. Later, suspecting that the attacks would make another attempt to kill the recovering guards to cover their tracks, Moegi disguised herself as one. The suspicions proved correct as a brainwashedYuritotried to poison her. Despite Moegi and Sakura cornering him, Yurito used the poison as a smokescreen to escape.

While Sakura was happy to have her husband back, she was dismayed by how little time he spent at home. Regardless, she decided to make his favourite dinner to welcome him home. Meanwhile, as Sasuke and Boruto were sent back in time to shortly after Sasuke's defection, past-Sakura bumped into the two. Fearing changing the future from interacting with his future wife, Sasuke decided to keep his distance. Sakura noted how similar Naruto and Boruto where, which the two bluntly denied.

Days later, as Sakura was returning home from another gruelling session of training with Tsunade, she bumped into adult Sasuke. He quickly apologised and rushed off, dropping a piece of paper in the process . Sakura looked at the contents. While it was revealed to be a letter with the message smeared too much to read, Sakura made out Sasuke's name written on it. Suspecting that Boruto knew something about Sasuke, she decided to confront him about it. Boruto, nervous about being found out, simply said that he knew a different Sasuke than the one she knew. While seeing that he was hiding something, Sakura decided to drop the subject with Boruto, instead finding the stranger's teacher to ask him directly. She later found the mysterious man battle anunknown assailantalongside Boruto and Jiraiya, who was after Naruto. When Sasuke's efforts proved futile thanks to his continued fatigue and the foe's strange abilities, he tackled the man into the river with him. While the man emerged unharmed but fuming at Sasuke's interference, Sakura fished Sasuke out of the river and hid him while using her new medical ninjutsu to treat him. Eventually, Sasuke awoke, accidentally addressing her by name. As she began to ask him questions, her efforts to heal Sasuke overtaxed her and she fainted. Sasuke gently laid her down before going to help his allies. Days later, after Urashiki was defeated and Sasuke and the others were discharged from the hospital, Sasuke and Boruto were ready to leave. Before they could, they were approached by Sakura again, still determined to learn ""the stranger's"" connection to Sasuke. As Sasuke fumbled to find an excuse, Jiraiya chimed in, giving an elaborate story about how they were avid fans of his and wanted to train under him, hence the injuries. Sakura ultimately accepted the story, finding the traveller strange. Before leaving, Sasuke used his Sharingan toeraseSakura's memories, along with everyone else of the past, of the recent events to protect the timeline. After Sasuke and Boruto returned to the present, Sasuke found his wife sleeping at the table, waiting for him. After she awoke and greeted him, she decided to make him some food, to which Sasuke warmly thanked her."
What was Sakura's concern about Sarada's rigorous training?,that Sarada was pushing herself too hard after just recovering,Kara actuation arc,"Main article:Kara Actuation ArcIn the anime, whenTeam 7was defeated byDeepa, the genin were brought back to the village for emergency care. As Sakura worked on Boruto, Shizune worked on Sarada. After a successful operation on both genin, Sakura voiced her concerns for the mental impact of the defeat on them. Three days later, Sarada and Boruto disappeared from their respective rooms in the hospital. Sakura however quickly deduced that the two would meet up with Konohamaru andMuginowho were ready for a mission to investigate Kara. To her relieve however, the children merely wanted to voice their trust in the older ninja to handle the mission while they would stay behind and commit themselves to grow stronger with hard training. Sakura conflicted on Sarada's rigorous training. Later, as Sarada sought intense training from Sasuke, Sakura watched from afar in concern for her daughter. As she continued to observe the gruelling conditions her daughter was going through, Sakura confronted her family. She voiced her concern that Sarada was pushing herself too hard after just recovering, and even more horrified to hear her talk about the Mangekyō Sharingan. While Sakura insisted that she couldn't push herself so recklessly, Sarada was furious to hear her mother baby her, refusing to see why she wanted to get stronger, and stormed off. Alone with her husband, Sakura admitted that, as a mother, she couldn't handle the thought of Sarada being injured again like she did. Likewise, she feared the path Sarada could potentially walk if she were to acquire the Mangekyō Sharingan. Sasuke insisted that, as parents, they have to prepare Sarada as much as possible for the world, and that she is strong as they were back then. Unable to fully accept Sasuke's view, Sakura was left depressed. Later that night, Ino and Hinata decided to take Sakura out on a girls' night out to talk. They insisted that, as mothers themselves, they too feared for their children's well-being, but they had to have faith that they were strong and could endure. Ino insisted that Sakura as a child had drive that pushed her forward, and Sarada inherited as much from Sakura as she did from Sasuke. Ino's words managed to cheer up Sakura. Sakura trains Sarada. The following day, Sakura decided to oversee Sarada's training personally. She insisted that just blindly facing the challenge wouldn't yield any results. She placed Sarada into a sparing match with her, quickly overwhelming her. Sakura then pointed out Sarada's biggest flaws. Sarada's chakra control was still underdeveloped, quickly burning through it in her various actions and unleashing it randomly when attacking; this affected both her combat performance and development of her Sharingan. Sarada's second problem was that her resolve was still too frail, fearing defeat. Determined to break past her limits, Sarada faced down Sakura again, using her Sharingan to mimic the movements and general timing of Sakura's attacks to reach a standstill. As Sakura tearfully criticised Sarada's recklessness, she was proud to see her daughter's inner strength was like her own, deciding to put Sarada through the same gruelling combat training Tsunade did to her to improve her chakra control."

What is Sakura's background?,a girl who cannot understand men,Creation and conception,"Although Sakura is the most recurring female character inNaruto,Masashi Kishimotodid not originally intend for Sakura to be the heroine of the series. Kishimoto attributes this to his being unable to draw good heroine characters, and fashioned Sakura as a girl who cannot understand men, the best example of a heroine he could come up with. Sakura's creation is a result of Kishimoto's desire to make a somewhat irritating character who was well-intentioned.[86]Despite these elements, Kishimoto is fond of Sakura, as he feels that many of her personality traits are common among all people, thus giving her a sense of real humanity.[87]When asked in an interview if there is something about Sakura's background that was never revealed, Kishimoto explains that he has never thought of Sakura as she is a ""normal girl.""[88] When designing Sakura, Kishimoto focused on her silhouette and created a costume as simple as possible. This is a divergence from the other main characters of the series, whose costumes are very detailed. The leggings are the most notable aspect of her design, as they are meant to show that she is very active.[86]At the start of the series her leggings extended below her knees and closely resembled trousers. As Part I progressed, the leggings became increasingly shorter and tighter.[89]Similar to his inexperience with drawing heroines, Kishimoto lacked the experience needed to make Sakura ""cute"" when he first began drawing her. Although he implies that her appearance has become cuter since then, Kishimoto and much of theNarutomanga staff agree that Sakura was ""far from cute"" at the start of the series.[86][90] Sakura's most well-known physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Because of this, Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large.[90]When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, so as to make her more feminine.[91] Kishimoto's staff have said that Sakura's pink hair was originally intended to give her a unique style and to resemble cherry blossoms, after which she is named.[citation needed]"
Who is Kakashi Hatake's childhood friend?,Obito Uchiha,Introduction,"Kakashi Hatake is ashinobiofKonohagakure'sHatake clan. Famed asKakashi of theSharingan and theCopy Ninja, he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students onTeam 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend,Obito Uchiha. After theFourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha'sSixthHokage."
How many years did Minato hold back against Kakashi?,2,Early life,"Kakashi finds his father dead. Because his mother died when he was very young,[15]Kakashi was raised during his early years by his father,Sakumo. Sakumo was famed throughout the shinobi world, having saved Konoha on at least one occasion; Kakashi in particular revered his father. Kakashi becomes a genin. In the Academy, Kakashi earned top grades, earning him recognition as a prodigy and the best of his generation.[16][4]Ultimately, he became very popular amongst his peers. With his talents soon being recognised, at age 5, Kakashi graduated from the Academy at the top of his class in a single year. When his classmates,Rin Noharaand Obito graduated three years later, they were teamed together, with Kakashi, under the leadership ofMinato Namikaze. In the anime, Minato gave the team abell testat its formation, assigning the three to take the two bells he kept on his person. Minato often held back less against the prodigious Kakashi than with Rin and Obito so they couldn't obtain the bells without teamwork. Unfortunately, Kakashi realised this, only using Obito and Rin as a means to an end to obtain the bells. Nonetheless, Minato passed them because they accomplished the goal of the test by working as a team. Minato did encourage them to improve their teamwork afterwards, a message that Obito and Rin took to heart, but fell upon deaf ears with Kakashi.[17]Team Minatowould go on many missions during its career, but Kakashi's devotion to the rules often made him difficult to work with;[18]Obito, already jealous of Kakashi's natural talent and popularity, was frequently at odds with him about this behaviour. At age 6, Konoha officials allowed Kakashi to compete in theChūnin Examswith his team, which he passed by defeatingMight Guyand became achūnin.[19] During one of Sakumo's missions - after Kakashi was promoted to chūnin -[20]Sakumo made the decision to save the lives of his teammates rather than complete the assignment. The mission's failure had disastrous consequences for theLand of Fire, causing many in Konoha, including the teammates he saved, to vilify him for abandoning his duties. Disgraced, Sakumo committed suicide. Seeing what his father went through and determined not to make the same mistakes, Kakashi decided that following theShinobi Rulesmust always take priority.[21]"
What is Minato's wife's name?,Kushina Uzumaki,Anbu career,"Kakashi joins the Anbu. Because he'd lost two teammates in such a short timespan, his role in Rin's death, and his failure to honour Obito's last request by protecting her, Kakashi dropped into a depression. In the anime, many believed he purposely killed Rin to prevent her from leaking information, earning him the nickname ""Friend-Killer Kakashi"". Many, especially those in Anbu believed he would kill a comrade without hesitation if it was for the sake of completing the mission. He would also spend his days avoiding friends and former classmates and at night he would be haunted by dreams of himself killing Rin again. Minato, now the newHokage, tried to help Kakashi emerge from the darkness he'd fallen into after Obito and Rin's deaths by assigning him to theAnbuin order to have him close in an attempt to alleviate his pain.[27]Kakashi did well in the Anbu, eventually becoming a captain and the leader ofTeam Ro. However, his successes were owed to his cold behaviour and his ruthlessness in combat, signs that he was still upset by Rin's death. Minato therefore tried a different tactic: assigning Kakashi to protect Minato's wife,Kushina Uzumaki, during her pregnancy. Kakashi carried out his duties faithfully, monitoring Kushina from the shadows whenever she left her home.[28]During his time off, he would visit Rin'sgraveand Obito'sengravingto tell them his regrets and how life was going without them.[29] Kakashi and his peers are blocked from helping Konoha. During theNine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, Kakashi and many of Konoha's other young ninja were prevented from helping defend the village, instead being confined within abarrierto keep them safe.[30]Minato eventually saved the village from theNine-Tails, but at the cost of his and Kushina's lives. After which,Danzō Shimuraapproached a grieving young Kakashi, noting that it wasHiruzen Sarutobi's orders for the children, even high-ranking ninja like Kakashi, to not help battle the Nine-Tails, ultimately preventing Kakashi from possibly saving Minato and Kushina. Convincing an emotional Kakashi that the Third was not best for the future of the village, Kakashi agreed to join Danzō'sRootdivision and spy on the Hokage for him. During a mission, Kakashi encountered another Root member codenamed ""Kinoe"" who was able to useWood Release.[28]Knowing that Wood Release was unique to theFirst Hokage, Kakashi broke in to theHokage Residenceto see what he could learn about this anomaly. The Third caught him, but freely gave him the information he wanted: Konoha had tried to recreate the Wood Release powers in the past, but abandoned the project for killing too many test subjects. The Third then mused that the Nine-Tails might have been defeated and Minato saved had the research been successful. Kakashi spares Kinoe's life. From this meeting with the Third, it became clear to Kakashi that the Third was not the ineffectual, passionless leader Danzō had made him out to be. Moreover, Danzō had not used Kinoe to try and stop the Nine-Tails' attack. Realising he had picked the wrong side, Kakashi told the Third about Danzō's plans to assassinate him and, the following day, personally lured out the assassins, of whom Kinoe was one. Kakashi easily defeated him, but chose to spare his life in the belief that he would become a valuable ally in the future. Kakashi attempted to resign from the Anbu afterwards for working against the Hokage, but the Third insisted his service was invaluable and made Kakashi his right-hand man.[31] Kakashi unable to stop Orochimaru. From investigating a series of disappearances, Kakashi provided a lead and it was discovered thatOrochimaruwas behind the Wood Release research that produced Kinoe. In the anime, Kakashi attacked Orochimaru when the Third Hokage failed to apprehend him, but he was paralysed by Orochimaru'skilling intentand Orochimaru escaped.[32]Kakashi followed him once he regained his composure, but was captured by theIburi clan, who were loyal to Orochimaru. Kinoe, their ally, convinced them to let him interrogate Kakashi. Once alone, Kinoe confided that Danzō was making his own plans against Orochimaru and, with help fromYukimi, helped Kakashi get free.[33]Kakashi later planned to use Yukimi to capture Orochimaru, since she was of great importance to him. Later, Kakashi explained that Yukimi's blood could temporarily bestow Orochimaru with the Iburi clan's smoke transformation, allowing him to slip across the border. Overhearing that, Yukimi slipped away and returned to the cave. Orochimaru ultimately killed most of the Iburi clan before escaping yet again, but Kakashi, recognising that Kinoe's relationship with Yukimi is much like his relationship with Rin was, helped keep her safe. Kakashi decided to leave and not report anything about the Iburi or Root's involvement.[34] Kakashi and Kinoe surrounded by Root. Kakashi continued to investigate Orochimaru over the following years, eventually locating one of his secret labs three years after the latter's defection. While there, he was attacked by Kinoe, who Danzō had sent to take his Sharingan. Kakashi tried to reason with him by stating that friendship should take higher priority than the mission. When Kinoe accused Kakashi of violating that creed by killing Rin, enraged by that comment, Kakashi overpowered him and decided to bring him before the Third Hokage.[35]Before they could leave, one of Orochimaru'ssnake experimentsescaped its test tube and attacked the duo. As Kinoe was taken captive, Kakashi managed to slay the creature. While saving Kinoe, the creature's corpse began emitting a poisonous vapour which quickly infected Kakashi. Kinoe got Kakashi out safely and, having accepted Kakashi's words, gave Kakashi an antidote and chose to abandon his mission whilst leaving Kakashi a message about it. When Kakashi woke up, he knew Danzō would punish Kinoe for insubordination and asked the Third for help. With the Third's permission, Kakashi forced his way into Root headquarters and stopped Danzō from applying acursed sealto Kinoe. As Root forces started to surround them, the Third showed up to personally authorise Kakashi's actions, and further negotiated Kinoe's release from Root. Kakashi added Kinoe, now with the new codename ""Tenzō"", to Team Ro.[36] Kakashi and Itachi mercilessly assassinate the Prajñā Group. Two years later,Itachi Uchihawas added to Team Ro. Kakashi and Itachi were at one point assigned to observe a meeting between Konoha and theLand of Woods. When the Land of Woods'Prajñā Grouptried to betray the Konoha forces, Kakashi and Itachi moved in and defeated them. Although Kakashi was impressed by Itachi's abilities, he warned him against his merciless approach and encouraged him on the importance of friends.[37]Sometime later, Itachi asked Kakashi if dead friends' requests should be honoured, which Kakashi said they should.[38]Itachi was eventually promoted out of Team Ro and replaced byYūgao Uzuki. Shortly afterwards, Team Ro was sent to theUchiha clan's compound with orders to pacify a brewing rebellion, only to find theentire clan dead. When news emerged that Itachi was responsible and that he had killed his best friend,Shisui Uchiha, in pursuit of power, Kakashi lamented his failure to have had a better influence on Itachi. Kakashi leaves the Anbu. Because of what happened with Itachi, the Third Hokage felt that individuals with kind hearts did not belong in the Anbu. He therefore thanked Kakashi for his years of service and relieved him of his duty, returning him to the standard forces.[39]Over the years, he was placed in charge of several teams of Academy graduates, but none ever demonstrated the teamwork he considered to be so important. In the anime, he started worrying that his own methods were too harsh, but from seeing how his former underlings that he previously failed prospered due to his teachings, his faith was reaffirmed.[17]"
How does Kakashi feel about his role as Hokage?,dutifully worked for the village's progress,Personality,"Kakashi's cold-heartedness. Kakashi has been very independent, perceptive, and self-confident since early childhood, and tends to broach difficult conversations with blunt pragmatism. He carries himself with a relaxed, almost bored disposition and is known for being solitary and aloof, with an occasional tendency to ignore his peers. These qualities lead some to perceive him as arrogant or condescending; however, Kakashi is truthfully quite modest about himself, even in the face of his growing reputation as a ninja and leader. He is also habitually tardy, showing up at his leisure with excuses that convince nobody, and later leaving for equally poor reasons. Though Kakashi wants others to believe this is how he always acts, he only does so for matters that aren't of particular importance. In his role as Hokage, Kakashi dutifully worked for the village's progress. He also believes that even in times of peace, no one should become a ninja without appreciating the importance of it. Kakashi suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Kakashi's life was shaped by the death of his childhood squadmates. He spends hours of his free time visiting Rin's grave and the Memorial Stone where Obito's name is engraved, telling them about his life, recent events in Konoha, and others they knew. Most of all, he shares his regrets that they cannot be with him and that their deaths were his fault. In the anime, after Rin died, Kakashi struggled to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, having nightmares about her death and growing depressed whenever others mentioned her. Over time, Kakashi comes to accept that her choice to sacrifice herself and his guilt became more about his broken promise to Obito to keep her safe. This causes Obito's apparent death to weigh more heavily on him, compounded by regrets about his behaviour when they last spoke. Kakashi feels that, had he cared about teamwork and friendship in the same way that Obito did, Obito's ""death"" might have been avoided. Thinking it would ease his pain, Minato convinced Kakashi to join the Anbu. During his time in the Anbu however, Kakashi gained a reputation for his cold-bloodedness.Kurenai Yūhinoted that Kakashi suffered with suicidal thoughts during his Anbu career, with his reckless fighting style and lack of self-care being deemed as Kakashi being in a hurry to die.[40] After his father's death, Kakashi initially became stern and cold toward others, chastising any who disobeyed orders and being willing to abandon his comrades to finish missions. However, Obito's apparent death profoundly changed him; he became committed to teamwork and always places teammates' well-being above the mission's. He believes goals can be accomplished more effectively together, asking for help when he needs it, providing help when it is requested of him, and praising allies when they deserve it. An abuse of one's teammates is the only thing that can make Kakashi cast aside his normally stoic demeanour, causing him to attack without mercy or his usual sense of sportsmanship. He expects his prospective students to demonstrate this same devotion to teamwork, which none until Team 7 were able to do; despite the high failure rate, the Third Hokage agrees with Kakashi's choice to require it. Kakashi becomes fond of all Team 7's members, even Sasuke Uchiha, to the point of blaming himself for Sasuke's criminal acts and his team's growing rift over it throughout Part II. He holds out hope that Sasuke will correct his behaviour, and for his patience he is able to see Team 7 reunified when by the end of theFourth Shinobi World War. Kakashi and Guy competing in their usual ""contests"". Might Guyhas considered Kakashi his rival ever since they first met in theAcademy. Despite his father's warning that Guy might someday prove stronger than him, Kakashi didn't think much of Guy at the time. Guy took this as a challenge and began striving to earn Kakashi's approval so as to show that his perseverance could be just as good as Kakashi's natural genius. When Guy would suggest contests to test how their abilities compared, Kakashi would respond with indifference, only fuelling Guy's desire to defeat his ""cool, hip, and trendy"" personality. At the start of Part I, Kakashi's score is 50 wins and 49 losses,[41]though even when Guy takes the lead the score difference remains the same; considering that their competitions range from eating contests to Rock, Paper, Scissors, the score isn't truly representative of anything. Kakashi eventually comes to consider Guy one of his closest and most reliable friends, and by the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, he acknowledges that Guy has surpassed him. Kakashi's obsession with theIcha Ichaseries. When he first meets his students onTeam 7, Kakashi claims to have many hobbies, none of which he chooses to share at the time. He is an avid fan of theIcha Ichaseries of novels; he always has one of the books with him and regularly reads it, even while talking to others.Naruto UzumakiidentifiesIcha Ichaas one of Kakashi's few weaknesses, which he is able to take advantage of during abell testby threatening to spoil the ending of the newest book in the series, forcing Kakashi to shut his eyes and ears and thereby leave himself vulnerable. Although most people he knows are aware of how much he likesIcha Icha, Kakashi is seemingly uncomfortable sharing the books with others, embarrassed by the presumably adult content. Following his retirement from active duty, Kakashi has become much more laid-back and unbothered by events and people surrounding him. His speech mannerisms and tone also resemble those of an old man. Although steadfast during any and all important events, Kakashi actively avoids taking on responsibilities during his free time, such as when he attempted to evadeBoruto's pleas for training. Furthermore, Kakashi also enjoys having others perform the most basic of chores on his behalf, such as roping Boruto into helping him with shopping duties, and initially refusing to help withSabureandYubeshi's issues with theirrespectivegrandparentsuntil being promised a rare first edition of anIcha Ichavolume, with an extended ending."
What is Kakashi's jutsu able to use to major effect for intimidation and distraction?,his Mangeky Sharingan,Abilities,"Kakashi intimidating opponents with his jutsu. Kakashi is one of the strongest ninja Konoha ever produced. A prodigy of such innate talent and intellect,[48]he showcased highly advanced skill from a young age.[49]From which, he rapidly rose through the ninja ranks.[50]His prowess is said to rival an entire country[51]and earned recognition on sight by various high-level ninja.[52]TheS-Rankmembers of Akatsuki acknowledge his might;[53]he outmanoeuvredItachi Uchiha, foughtKisame HoshigakiandKakuzuto a standstill, and was deemed a major threat byPain.[54]AgainstKoji Kashin, one ofKara's strongest Inners, Kakashi was able to pressure the foe into retreating.[55] In general, Kakashi is very versatile with advanced proficiency in countless areas including mastery of all three main ninja skills; noted as smarter thanShikamaru Nara, better sense of smell thanKiba Inuzuka, more adept with theSharinganthanSasuke Uchiha, and bettertaijutsuskill thanRock Lee, each of whom are well-known for their high capacities in their respective areas.[56]Kakashi'sgenjutsuprowess is able to use basic techniques to major effect for intimidation and distraction.[57]Kakashi's combat and tactical prowess are so revered, that many foresaw his rise to Hokage status years before it happened.[58]However, theSage of Six Pathsbelieved Kakashi's greatest strength is as a teacher, leader, and friend, all of which proved vital inKaguya Ōtsutsuki's defeat.[59]Even after losing his Sharingan, Kakashi's combat prowess continued to increase.[57]"
What is the name of Kakashi's personal pack of ninken?,Kakashi's ninken,Ninjutsu,"Kakashi using Rasengan. In battle, Kakashi primarily relies on his great skill and knowledge ofninjutsu. As an Academy Student, he excelled past his peers in ninjutsu, being able to use theMultiple Shadow Clone Technique.[63]Over the years, due in large part to hisSharingan, he gained a vast arsenal; reputed to have copied over a thousand techniques, which led to his moniker as ""Copy Ninja Kakashi"" .[64]This, combined with years of experience, Kakashi can handle almost any situation in various ways. He is also well-versed infūinjutsu, impressingOrochimaru.[65]Many years after theFourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi became skilled enough inMedical Ninjutsuto ease physical pain with a mere touch.[57] Kakashi's ninken. Kakashi has his own personal pack ofninken, which he raised since they were puppies; in the anime, he is shown using them during theThird Shinobi World War.[66]In the field, he cansummonone or more of his ninken to fetch things for him, restrain targets,[67]or deliver messages. More commonly, he uses them for tracking, picking up trails, or seeking out targets he doesn't know where to look for. Kakashi wielding Kubikiribōchō. Kakashi is highly skilled in a wide variety of weapons such asbows and arrows,kusarigama,chains, andwire strings. Since childhood, Kakashi was highly proficient inkenjutsu, being able to wield hisfather's signature tantōeffectively enough to be mistaken for Sakumo. From his background in the Anbu, Kakashi's swordsmanship became very adaptable, able to effectively utilise theKubikiribōchō,[68]a uniquely shaped blade with noticeable size and weight, and able to defeat kenjutsu experts such as the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.[69]He also has considerable skill inshurikenjutsu, being able to lash out at an opponent with a swift flurry of kunai and even effectively throw kunai with a well-placed kick.[70]Likewise in close range battles, he can skillfully use use weapons in both hands simultaneously and even fend off other skilled melee combatants such as Zabuza and Hidan, armed with their respective unique weapons, using a single kunai. Kakashi's signature technique, the Lightning Cutter. Kakashi can use all five basicnature transformations, as well as theYin ReleaseandYang Release.[5]He can useWater Releasewithout a nearby water source,[71]and is able to producemassive offensive, anddefensive structures. WithEarth Release, he canmove undergroundfor sneak attacks or producemultiple intricate wallsto defend himself or large areas from attack.[72]Years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi learned to convert his Earth Release techniques intoquartz. Improving the quality of his techniques in this way negates its weakness to lightning-based nature attacks by absorbing and dissipating opposing techniques.[57]He is shown usingFire Releaseto launch amassive fireball.[73] Kakashi using Lightning Release: Purple Electricity. Kakashi's natural affinity isLightning Release,[74]which he canchannelto enhance his physical tools offensive might to pierce and pass through large rocks.[75].[76]After failing to infuse the Rasengan with his lightning nature, he instead created his signature technique,Chidori.[77]It is collection of lightning chakra in the hand that can pierce most targets that it is thrust into, which he later refined to once famously split a bolt of lightning with, earning the name ""Lightning Cutter"".[78]He can use it both hands simultaneously and counter other lightning attacks. Other lightning techniques include creatinghoundsto attack with,clonesthat paralyse opponents on contact,[79]andcordsthat can even cut through the highly denseTailed Beast Chakra Arms. By his tenure as the Sixth Hokage, he created a new signature technique; theLightning Release: Purple Electricity, which allows him to release a surge of purple lightning to produce a variety of effects: attack from afar, augment his physical strikes, and release a burst from all around him."
When did Kakashi receive his Sharingan?,Third Shinobi World War,Dōjutsu,"Kakashi's Sharingan. Kakashi received his Sharingan during theThird Shinobi World WarfromObito Uchiha, a replacement for the left eye he'd lost shortly beforehand. The Sharingan became his most identifying feature in the years since then, such that he is widely known as ""Kakashi of the Sharingan"" . With this dōjutsu, Kakashi can accurately reproduce any movement he sees , take in a heightened amount of visual information, and perform the Sharingan's broad category ofgenjutsu. Because he isn't anUchiha, he can't deactivate the Sharingan and it rapidly drains his chakra whenever he uses it, leaving him bedridden after extended use.[80]As such, he always keeps the eye covered until he needs it. Due to these challenges, Kakashi hasn't mastered every aspect of the Sharingan,[81][82]Despite his handicap, he is still noted to have impressive prowess wielding it, as noted by both Itachi and Obito Uchiha.[83][84]Kakashi lost his Sharingan during theFourth Shinobi World War.[85]When Obito died with both his Sharingan, his spirit briefly returned from the afterlife and inhabited Kakashi's body. During which, Obito channelled both his eyes' dōjutsu power into Kakashi, granting full usage of their abilities with no strains or setbacks. The loss of his Sharingan during the war resulted in him no longer using his Lightning Cutter safely, as the tunnel vision was no longer countered by the Sharingan. Kakashi's Mangekyō Sharingan. Kakashi gained aMangekyō SharinganwhenRin Noharadied,[25]which he could use after long hours of study and training.[20]Its design appears as three triangles wrapping themselves around the pupil, similar to a pinwheel. He was able to maintain it for over a decade, though he was steadily suffering its side-effects with each usage, such as bleeding eyes and deteriorating vision. With his left Mangekyō, Kakashi can use the long-range variant ofKamui: remotely forming a barrier around whatever he looks at to warp the target toKamui's dimension; eventually, he learns how to send himself to the dimension and to a new location from it.[86]While initially had trouble to aim Kamui properly.[87]he improved to the point that he can accurately use Kamui on fast-moving projectiles.[88]Originally, it requires some amount of preparation and has a huge drain on chakra each time it is performed, but later could perform to fast for most people to even most, and use it repeatedly it with much lower drain of chakra.[89] Kakashi's Complete Body — Susanoo. After Kakashi loses his Sharingan, his body is temporarily inhabited by Obito's spirit, allowing him to use both of Obito's Mangekyō. Due to these eyes possessingSix Paths Chakra, this allowed Kakashi to utilize the Mangekyō Sharingan and its abilities with much greater power, as well as repeated and extended use of them with no ill effects to his health, chakra, or eyesight.[90]In addition to the long-range Kamui he'd originally had, he could use its short-range variant to overlap his body with Kamui's dimension, effectively making him intangible so that any dangers phase through him.[91]Bycombining this abilitywith his Lightning Cutter, Kakashi can bypass all defences and eliminate the possibility of being countered while attacking. Having manifested a dual Mangekyō, Kakashi can useSusanoo, which he honed into its ""Complete Body"" form. It can be used for flight, defend others with its large size, and even have the intangibility of Kamui extended to it. It can manifest either swords or shuriken to aid him in battle, the latter of which can produceKamui Shurikenin order to warp away whatever they cut. Kakashi lost all these abilities after Obito's spirit returned to the afterlife."
What is Sasuke about to clash with Naruto's Rasengan?,Chidori,Sasuke recovery mission,"Main article:Sasuke Recovery Mission Kakashi stops the fight between Naruto and Sasuke. Kakashi is not done recovering when he is given a mission assignment, a consequence of Konoha's lack of manpower following the failed invasion. Before leaving, he stops by the hospital where Sasuke has been staying after his own encounter with Itachi and finds Sasuke in the middle of combat with Naruto. As Sasuke is about to clash his Chidori with Naruto'sRasengan, Kakashi catches them both and flings them apart. Kakashi starts questioning Sasuke about his apparent intentions to kill Naruto, but Sasuke leaves rather than be lectured. Kakashi also notices Jiraiya nearby and, assuming Naruto learned the Rasengan from him, asks if that was a good idea; Jiraiya asks the same about teaching Sasuke the Chidori. Kakashi asks Jiraiya to speak with Naruto while he speaks with Sasuke. Before he goes, he assures Sakura that he'll set things right. Kakashi lecturing Sasuke. Kakashi locates Sasuke and ties him to a tree in order to force him to listen to what he has to say. He starts by trying to discourage Sasuke from avenging theUchiha clan, insisting that, even if he's successful, it won't bring back those who are already dead. Sasuke retorts that Kakashi doesn't understand what he's going through and offers to kill the people most precious to Kakashi, only for Kakashi to reply that those very people are already dead. Sasuke is surprised and puts up less resistance, so Kakashi tells him that taking revenge for those that he's lost is not worth also losing those he still has, namely Naruto and Sakura. To that end, he encourages Sasuke to start using Chidori for its intended purpose: protecting friends rather than attacking them. He unties Sasuke and leaves for his mission, intending for what he said to sink in. When he returns, Tsunade informs him that Sasuke has defected to Orochimaru and that Naruto and ateam of geninwere sent after him. Upset with himself for not spending more time defusing Sasuke's angst, Kakashi goes after him, fearful that he and Naruto may kill each other. He summons his ninken to help him track Sasuke and Naruto, eventually finding the latter unconscious at theValley of the End. Because it's raining he can't find Sasuke's trail, and besides Naruto needs medical attention. He takes him back to Konoha and releases him into the care of theMedic Corps. With Sasuke gone to Orochimaru, Naruto decides to start training with Jiraiya and Sakura trains with Tsunade. Having no students to lead anymore, Kakashi resumes his prior mission schedule."
Who is the first person to greet Naruto when he returns from his two-and-a-half years of training with Jiraiya?,Kakashi,Kazekage rescue mission,"Main article:Kazekage Rescue Mission Kakashi facing Sakura during the bell test. Kakashi is the first person to greet Naruto when he returns from his two-and-a-half years of training with Jiraiya. Naruto gives him a copy ofIcha Icha Tacticsas a present, which Kakashi wastes no time starting to read. As Naruto goes off to see Sakura, Jiraiya warns Kakashi that Akatsuki will be making a move in the near future. After Naruto and Sakura have had a chance to catch-up, Kakashi reforms Team 7 and gives them anotherbell test. Unlike last time, taking the bells from him is the real objective. Kakashi also decides to take the test seriously by uncovering his Sharingan and closing his copy ofIcha Icha Tactics. As with last time, Naruto launches a first attack before the test officially begins, but this time it nearly succeeds. Kakashi is impressed by this and other signs of their improvement, but by nightfall they still haven't taken a bell. Tired of this, Naruto tries spoiling the ending ofIcha Icha Tactics, forcing Kakashi to cover his ears so as not to hear it and shut his eyes so as not to read Naruto's lips. This allows Naruto and Sakura to each take a bell. Kakashi fights ""Itachi"". While Team 7 tries without success to find a mission to go on that Naruto won't complain about, word reaches Konoha that Akatsuki has kidnappedGaara, the FifthKazekageand thejinchūrikiof theOne-Tail. Team 7 is sent toSunagakureto lend assistance in rescuing Gaara. When they arrive in Suna, Kakashi is attacked byChiyo, who mistook him forhis father, but her brotherEbizōcleared up the confusion before the attack could connect, to Kakashi's great relief at the close call. Team 7 gathers what intel they can on Gaara's kidnappers and leave to go after them; Chiyo volunteers to escort them since they aren't familiar with the country around Suna. While en route to an Akatsuki lair, they are confronted byItachi Uchiha. While they fight him, Kakashi notices something is off about Itachi, notably his lack of use of theMangekyō Sharingan. The reason for this is discovered after Naruto seemingly kills him with aBig Ball Rasengan: they were only fighting adoppelgänger. Kakashi using Kamui on Deidara. Team 7 arrives at the Akatsuki lair shortly afterTeam Guydoes, who were sent as backup byTsunade. After Team Guy takes down the barrier over the entrance, Team 7 moves in and finds Gaara's body with his kidnappers:DeidaraandSasori. Deidara takes Gaara's body and flies off, which Naruto and Kakashi go after, leaving Sasori to Sakura and Chiyo. Naruto makes repeated failed attempts to rescue Gaara, prompting Kakashi to encourage patience while he prepares a new ability: a Mangekyō Sharingan of his own. Once he's ready, Kakashi usesKamuion Deidara, but his aim is off and he succeeds only in removing one of Deidara's arms. This creates an opening for Naruto to take Gaara back, which Deidara responds to by creating aSuicide Bombing Cloneto cover his escape; Kakashi uses Kamui again to warp the explosion away. After they regroup with Chiyo and Sakura, Chiyogives her lifeto revive Gaara. Teams 7 and Guy attend her funeral in Sunagakure before returning home. Kakashi is unable to walk due to overusing his Mangekyō Sharingan, forcingMight Guyto carry him; Guy's choice of carrying Kakashi by piggyback deeply disturbs their students."
How long does it take Naruto to learn how to use the wind nature?,a mere fraction of the time,Akatsuki suppression mission,"Main article:Akatsuki Suppression Mission Kakashi explaining the concept of chakra affinity. Although Team 7 was able to meet Sasuke, he was too strong for them to capture and bring back to Konoha. Once Kakashi's done recuperating he calls them before him and is introduced toSai, who is effectively Sasuke's replacement on the team; they speak only briefly but both of approve of each other. Kakashi believes the best way to match Sasuke would be for Naruto to create a newjutsu. Before he can elaborate further, they are interrupted by the arrival ofAsuma Sarutobiand the rest ofTeam 10. When their students leave to have dinner, Asuma lingers behind to discuss something with Kakashi, only to change his mind whenKurenai Yūhicomes looking for him. Kakashi and Naruto learn about Asuma's death. To help Naruto create a new jutsu, Kakashi first establishes what hisnatureis:wind. With that settled, Kakashi trains Naruto in how to learn to use the wind nature. Ordinarily, such training would take months or years, but Naruto, by training alongside hundreds ofshadow clones, can do the same training in a mere fraction of the time. With Kakashi's instructions and the training grounds created by Yamato, Naruto quickly masters how to use the wind nature. The next step is more difficult for him: combining that nature with theRasengan. Because Kakashi andMinato Namikazeboth failed to combine their natures with the Rasengan, Kakashi can't offer Naruto any tips and can only watch as he tries to develop something. When they receive news that Asuma died in battle with members of Akatsuki, they take a break to attend Asuma's funeral. Kakashi destroys one of Kakuzu's hearts. Because he can be of no further assistance to Naruto, Kakashi leaves Yamato in charge of watching over him. Kakashi, meanwhile, volunteers to help Team 10 avenge Asuma;Shikamaru Nara, having previously come up with a plan, modifies it to take Kakashi's presence into consideration. Once they locate the Akatsuki members,HidanandKakuzu, Kakashi hides until Kakuzu is driven to use hisEarth Spear, at which point Kakashi pierces him through the heart with his Lightning Cutter. Kakuzu, who has more than one heart, fends Kakashi off and uses the elemental masks of hisEarth Grudge Fearto put Team 10 on the defensive. Needing to separate Hidan and Kakuzu if they're to have any chance of victory, Shikamaru takes a vial of Kakuzu's blood that Kakashi secretly collected and leads Hidan away. Shikamaru is able to trick Hidan into using the blood tocurseKakuzu, destroying a second of his hearts in time to stop him from stealing Kakashi's. Kakashi talks to Kakuzu before killing him. Angered by the loss of two hearts, Kakuzu prepares to kill Kakashi and Team 10. His attack is blocked by the combined efforts of Naruto and Yamato, who arrive with Sakura and Sai to lend assistance. Kakashi summonsPakkunto lead Sakura and Sai to Shikamaru in case he needs help while everyone else prepares to attack Kakuzu. Naruto, having finished his jutsu, volunteers to face Kakuzu alone. His newWind Release: Rasenshurikenis temperamental, however, forcing Kakashi and Yamato to rescue him when it fails on its first use. It succeeds the second time, destroying two of Kakuzu's hearts and putting the last one on the brink of failure. Kakashi is deeply impressed by the Rasenshuriken and tells Kakuzu that the previous generation being surpassed by the next was perfectly natural. Kakashi then finished Kazuku off with a Lightning Cutter."
What does Kakashi try to corner the Deva Path so that he can destroy it with his Lightning Cutter?,Iruka Umino,Pain's assault,"Main article:Pain's AssaultBack in Konoha, Kakashi is informed that Jiraiya has died while investigating the Akatsuki leader,Pain. He is present when this news is shared with Naruto, who was too distraught to be of assistance and needed some time alone. Before he died, Jiraiya sent a number of things to Konoha that would help them against Pain, including an encrypted message. Shikamaru is able to properly console and get Naruto to help him decode it, who realises that the key to its decryption must beIcha Icha Tactics. Kakashi, having the only copy, is asked to read specific passages aloud, which makes him extremely uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the message is deciphered. Kakashi confronts Pain. PainattacksKonoha soon afterwards; while some of theSix Paths of Paindraw attention to themselves, others avoid conflict and try to learn the whereabouts of Naruto, who has gone toMount Myōbokuto train. Kakashi guesses this tactic and goes searching for one of the latter group. In doing so he finds theDeva Path, and by confronting it he is able to saveIruka Umino. Kakashi tries to corner the Deva Path so that he can destroy it with his Lightning Cutter, but it repels him withShinra Tensei. Pain, recognising that Kakashi is a dangerous opponent, sends theAsura Pathto help the Deva Path. Kakashi struggles against both due to the shared vision of theirRinnegan, but their clashing jutsu at least attracts reinforcements' attention:ChōzaandChōji Akimichicripple the Asura Path when they arrive. Kakashi defeated by Pain. From careful observation of the Deva Path's abilities, Kakashi notices a brief cool down period between its jutsu. To take advantage of this, Kakashi plants chains under it and has Chōza and Chōji attack it from opposite sides. When they are deflected by Shinra Tensei, they grab the chains and restrain him, giving Kakashi an opportunity to attack with his Lightning Cutter. Before he can land the blow, the Asura Path uses itself as a shield, giving the Deva Path time to counter. It defeats all of Kakashi's reinforcements and binds Kakashi in rubble. Anticipating that Kakashi will interfere if allowed to live, the Deva Path propels a nail at his head to kill him and leaves. Kakashi, however, only pretends death, warping away the nail at the last moment with Kamui. When Chōji wakes up, Kakashi sends him to Tsunade to tell her everything they've learned about the Deva Path's abilities. The still-functioning Asura Path fires a missile at Chōji in an attempt to stop him, forcing Kakashi to use Kamui again to warp away the missile. This depletes his chakra reserves and causes his death. Kakashi talks to his father. After dying, Kakashi finds his father,Sakumo, waiting for him. He entreats Kakashi to tell him about his life, which Kakashi complies to. He concludes his story by saying that he understands the choices Sakumo made when he was alive and that he is proud to be his son. Just then, a light envelops Kakashi, a sign of hisrevival; before Kakashi returns to the living plane, Sakumo thanks him for putting him at peace at long last, allowing him to continue to the afterlife. Kakashi wakes up, surprising those nearby. He is informed of what happened while he was dead, such as that Pain destroyed the village and that Naruto, upon returning, defeated Pain. As Naruto returns to Konoha, Kakashi goes to meet him and carries him back, where his victory is celebrated by all the villagers."
How many reincarnated members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mistappear on the battlefield before Kakashi has a chance to put his plan into action?,four,Fourth shinobi world war: confrontation,"Main article:Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation Kakashi and his division begin their strategy. Kakashi is appointed as commander of theAllied Shinobi Forces'Third Division. In the anime, he requests that Guy be his second-in-command. The Third Division is mobilised ahead of the other divisions in order to be on hand for any eventuality. While seeking out an Akatsuki force, they notice and heads towards one of theSurprise Attack Division's distress flares. The Third Division arrives in time to save them from the reincarnatedGari,Pakura,Haku, andZabuza Momochi. Haku and Zabuza recognise Kakashi and Sakura and ask how Naruto is doing. Kabuto, their summoner, ends their conversation short by suppressing their personalities, so Haku and Zabuza they use their last moments to beg Kakashi to defeat them. Kakashi impales Zabuza. Zabuza uses theHiding in Mist Techniqueto hide his and the others' movements, putting the Third Division on the defensive. Kakashi is able to analyse their attack strategy and formulate a response, but other reincarnated members of theSeven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mistappear on the battlefield before Kakashi has a chance to put his plan into action. Despite mounting casualties, Kakashi sticks to his original plan: he sneaks up on Zabuza and attacks with the Lightning Cutter, intending to dispel the heavy mist. Like the last time they fought, Haku shields the attack and Zabuza cuts at Kakashi through Haku with hisKubikiribōchō. Kakashi avoids injury and attacks with another Lightning Cutter, this time hitting Zabuza and also connectingEnsui Nara'sshadowto his. With Zabuza immobilised and Haku damaged, both are bound by theSealing Team. Kakashi, upset by how Zabuza and Haku were used for Akatsuki's purposes, takes up the Kubikiribōchō and promises to live up to his reputation as the copier of a thousand jutsu. Kakashi fending off Jinin. With the mist gone, the swordsmen seemingly retreat. Kakashi takes this opportunity to allow his team to rest and recuperate. The next day, in the anime, Kakashi defeatsJinin Akebino,[101]and later teams up with Guy to keepJinpachi MunashiandKushimaru Kuriararebusy until they are also sealed.[102]By the time he helps Sai sealFuguki Suikazan, only three reincarnated shinobi remain.

"What does Tobi use against Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy?",the Four-Tailsand Six-Tailsto enter Tailed Beast Modes,Fourth shinobi world war: climax,"Main article:Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax Kakashi and Guy save Naruto. Kakashi and Guy eventually leave the Third Division to join the original Naruto andKiller Bin their fight withTobi, arriving in time to stop Tobi from capturing Naruto. Seeing that Tobi has six reincarnatedjinchūriki, Kakashi theorises that they are each possess one of theSix Paths Techniques, just as the Six Paths of Pain did. From fighting them, however, none use the any of the Six Paths Techniques, leading Kakashi to believe Tobi doesn't have the energy for it. Tobi can, at least, still use theirtailed beasts' powers, so he forces theFour-TailsandSix-Tailsto enterTailed Beast Modes. Unable to do anything against such large opponents, Kakashi and Guy leave them to Naruto and B. Kakashi attacks the Demonic Statue. After Naruto is able to free the Four-Tails from Tobi's control, Tobi forces the other jinchūriki to enter Tailed Beast Modes as well. As fiveTailed Beast Ballsbear down on them, Kakashi considers trying to use Kamui. It ends up not being necessary as Naruto, by entering his own Tailed Beast Mode, deflects their attacks and subsequently frees them from Tobi.

Fighting continues into the night, with neither side emerging victorious. When a light descends on the reincarnated jinchūriki, a sign that the Impure World Reincarnation has been cancelled, Tobi takes drastic action and prematurely initiates theTen-Tails' revival. When they realise what Tobi is doing, Kakashi and the others focus on destroying the Demonic Statue before it can complete its metamorphosis into the Ten-Tails. Kakashi attacks Tobi. Tobi defends the Demonic Statue from all of their attacks and, as ever, is himself seemingly impervious to damage, with everything passing through him. After an exchange of attacks, of which Kakashi blocks Tobi's with Kamui, Kakashi notices some slight damage to Tobi's mask. Having a theory about this, he has Guy and Naruto help him test it and is ultimately able to confirm: attacks warped away with Kamui at the same moment that Tobi is impervious will damage Tobi, thereby suggesting a link between their abilities. Kakashi asks where Tobi acquired his Sharingan, to which he replies it was on the same mission to theKannabi Bridgethat Kakashi got his own. Kakashi is troubled by what this might mean, but doesn't overlook the important fact that they now have a way of fighting Tobi. Kakashi secretly uses Kamui on one of Naruto's shadow clones to send it toKamui's dimensionwhich, when Tobi retreats there to escape the real Naruto's attack, attacks Tobi and destroys his mask. When they see his face, Guy and Kakashi recognise Tobi asObito Uchiha. Kakashi and Guy are shocked to see Obito alive. Kakashi is devastated to discover that the friend whose death he's mourned for over a decade is actually alive. Kakashi asks Obito why he never returned to Konoha, to which Obito replies that it's because Kakashi allowedRin Noharato die. Obito assures Kakashi that he doesn't blame him for the world's flaws before attacking him withFire Release: Blast Wave Wild Dance. Obito is soon joined by a reincarnatedMadara Uchiha, who decides to take Naruto's Nine-Tails and Killer B'sEight-Tailsbefore the Ten-Tails is revived. Kakashi, meanwhile, tries to question Obito more, who ignores him and instead uses his own Kamui on Kakashi. Kakashi figures out how to use Kamui to return, prompting Obito to try to kill him. Naruto blocks the attack and vows not to let his teammates die. Kakashi battling Obito. Naruto's words remind Kakashi of the Obito he used to know, inspiring him to join the offensive again. After the Nine-Tails replenishes his chakra, Kakashi lets Obito send him to Kamui's dimension, where he attacks Obito's body parts whenever they transport there to avoid Naruto's attacks. He then uses Kamui to return, only to witness the Ten-Tails complete its revival. Obito and Madara attach themselves to the Ten-Tails, focusing it destructive power against Kakashi and the others. Just as they are about to be killed, the combined Allied Shinobi Forces arrive to help, deflecting the Ten-Tails' Tailed Beast Ball. Sakura heals Kakashi and they then join the Allies' coordinated effort to restrain the Ten-Tails, but it breaks free by transforming. Many die in the Ten-Tails' counterattack, but another coordinated assault successfully removes the Ten-Tails from Madara and Obito's control. Kakashi and Obito pierce each other. Now free to act on its own, the Ten-Tails prepares to useTenpenchii. Kakashi attempts to stop it with Kamui, but Obito intercepts him and takes him to Kamui's dimension. When they get there, Kakashi lunges at Obito with a Lightning Cutter, but stops short of actually killing him with it. When Obito accuses him of having a guilty conscience, Kakashi tries to explain the circumstances of Rin's death, but Obito is already aware that she chose to die. That fact alone convinces Obito that the world as it is isn't worth protecting. Accepting that Obito's mind can't be changed, Kakashi attack in order to protect the world that the Obito he used to know cared about. After a prolonged exchange, Kakashi pierces Obito's heart with alightning-infused kunai. Obito escapes and Kakashi, similarly badly damaged, collapses."

As Kakashi treats his wounds, he catches brief glimpses of what Obito sees due to their common Sharingan: his fight with Naruto and Sasuke. Kakashi ponders Obito's persistence in trying to convince Naruto that his actions are justified and concludes that Obito himself is not actually convinced that they are. He returns to the battle just after Obito's defeat, prepared to personally finish him off, but he is stopped by a reincarnatedMinato Namikaze. Having sensed the same misgivings in Obito that Kakashi did, Minato convinces Kakashi to try yet again to speak with him. Kakashi acknowledges that Rin's death is proof of a flawed system that it may not be possible to fix, but he believes that Naruto should at least be given a chance to try since he still has his friends to empower him. Kakashi and Minato confront Black Zetsu. Obito decides to put the same faith in Naruto that Kakashi has and, in order to make up for all that he's done, prepares to use theSamsara of Heavenly Life Techniqueto revive everyone that has died. Because this will cost Obito his life, Kakashi tries to convince him to find another way to make amends, but Obito replies that he doesn't deserve such an easy solution. As he is performing the technique, however, Obito's body is taken over byBlack Zetsu. Kakashi and Minato are confused by what's happened, so Obito explains that he's been forced to revive Madara instead. Black Zetsu then attempts to take Obito'sRinnegan, but the presence of Kakashi and Minato prevents it from safely doing so. It decides instead to fully take control of Obito's body so that they can't attack it without damaging Obito too. As they wait, the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path is summoned by Madara from Obito's body; Kakashi tries to use Kamui on it, but succeeds only in removing its right arm. Obito briefly regains control for long enough to implore Kakashi to destroy his Rinnegan so that Madara can't acquire that too. Just as Kakashi and Minato psych themselves up to do so, they are met by Gaara and Sakura, who are working to keep Naruto alive after Madara removed the Nine-Tails from his body. Gaara asks Minato to seal his half of the Nine-Tails chakra into Naruto in order to save his life. Black Zetsu intercepts this transfer and takes the Nine-Tails for itself. Madara, now the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, soon arrives to see what's taking Black Zetsu so long. Black Zetsu attempts to go to him, but Obito reasserts control over his body and forces it to stay. Kakashi using Kamui on Obito. Obito decides that he will help save Naruto. He first steals fragments of Madara's chakra and then instructs Kakashi to send Naruto and Sakura to Kamui's dimension. He plans to go there to join Naruto, but his own Kamui is slow enough for Madara to stop him. Kakashi, by using Kamui on Obito at the same time that he uses it on himself, is able to accelerate the teleportation and allow him to get away; the attack that misses Obito nearly kills Kakashi, but he is saved by Guy. Aware of how few options they have, Guy decides to use theEight Gates Released Formationover Kakashi's protests. Because Guy's time is limited, Kakashi, Minato, Gaara, andRock Leecombine efforts to neutralise as many of Madara'sTruth-Seeking Ballsas they can: Kakashi, carried by Gaara, warps away part of a defensive wall Madara erects around himself. In the end, Guy badly injures Madara before he collapses, but fails to defeat him. Naruto restores Kakashi's eye. Madara is stopped from finishing Guy off by Naruto's return, who Obito successfully saved. Naruto and Sasuke team up against Madara, putting him on the defensive and making him desperate for the Rinnegan in Obito's possession.

She prepares to treat Kakashi's eye, but Naruto steps in and uses hisSix Paths chakrato restore Kakashi's original eye. As they wait for Madara's inevitable return, Kakashi reminds them of their first lesson as Team 7: the importance of teamwork. Madara eventually returns, Black Zetsu using his control over Obito's body to teleport them back.

The Sage of Six Paths explains how Naruto and Sasuke can end the Infinite Tsukuyomi, but Sasuke has one intention before that: killing the tailed beasts and theFive Kage. Kakashi is dismayed, assuming Sasuke is still after revenge. Sasuke replies that he only wants to change the world for the better, making hard decisions like this so that the world won't get embroiled in another war. Too exhausted to do anything himself, Kakashi stays behind with Sakura while Naruto and Sasuke leave to fight; the Sage of Six Paths uses his last moments to talk with Kakashi, remarking that the centuries of hate may be on the verge of ending due to the love Naruto displays for everyone.

AsHōki Taketoribegan getting frustrated on what to do, Sukea noted that the Sixth Hokage was not without his own failures and shames, that his greatest regret from childhood was trying to control everything to such excess that it recklessly cost him a dear friend. As he realised that he was making the same mistake, Hōki also realised from Sukea's hints that there were more bombs still in circulation. Putting aside their differences, Team 25 decided to work together, working to their personal strengths to find the remaining bombs and avert disaster. Following this, by Kakashi's recommendation, Team 25's injured jōnin-sensei was replaced bySai Yamanaka."

Despite this, noting the unpredictable nature of Orochimaru, the meeting ended with deeming the Oto-born boy as a threat.

What is the name of the character that Kakashi acts as a link between the other main characters of the series?,Masashi Kishimoto,Creation and conception,"Masashi Kishimotooriginally intended for Kakashi to debut in the second chapter of theNarutomanga, appearing prior to the other members ofTeam 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite ""de gozaru"" in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7.[109]Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified.[110]Because he acts as a link between the other main characters of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene.[111][112]In an interview inShōnen Jump's, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi.[113] When deciding upon Kakashi's name, Kishimoto considered a number of possibilities: Kuwa , Kama , Botan , Enoki , and Kakashi . He eventually decided upon Kakashi, and remains glad that he did to this day.[114]In keeping with the meaning of his name, scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi; Naruto, for example, uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two.[115]Likewise, scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears, as is the case with the cover ofNarutomanga volume three.[116]"
Who was Itachi Uchiha's younger brother?,Sasuke,Introduction,"Itachi Uchiha was ashinobiofKonohagakure'sUchiha clanwho served as anAnbuCaptain. He later became an international criminal aftermurderinghis entire clan, sparing only his younger brother,Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known asAkatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end."
When was Itachi a big brother to Sasuke?,At age 5,Background,"Itachi and Sasuke moments before the Nine-Tails' attack. Itachi was the first child born toMikotoandFugaku Uchiha. His early childhood was marked with violence: when he was four years old, theThird Shinobi World Warwaged and he witnessed first-hand many of the war's casualties. The death and destruction he experienced at such a young age traumatised Itachi and made him a pacifist,[6]leading to him training non-stop to achieve his dream of becoming a ninja among ninja in order to erase fighting from the world.[7]At age 5, after becoming a big brother to Sasuke, Itachi was approached byShisui, who offered to train together. Soon, the two became best friends, forming a brother-like bond as they continued to teach the other new tricks. During theNine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, he was home alone looking after Sasuke, followed by Itachi rescuing Mikoto from falling debris,[8]and in the anime seeking shelter withIzumi.[9]The Nine-Tails' attack had soured relations between Konoha's leadership and the Uchiha, the former believing the latter to be responsible. The Uchiha were relocated to the edge of the village, isolating them from the rest of the village and making it easier to monitor them. At age 6, Itachi enrolled into theAcademy, where he consistently scored the highest in each subject and quickly learned any skill taught to him, resulting in him being praised as the best his teachers had ever seen.[10][7]After four months, achieving perfect grades from the start, his teachers unanimously agreed let him take the graduation exam early due to Itachi being more than advanced enough for genin-level, which he passed later that month.[11]During this time, he began seriously studying the history of the world, gaining a great appreciation for it. On the day he graduated as the youngest post-wargraduate, he was approached byDanzō Shimura, who assessed Itachi's thinking.[12] JoiningTeam 2, Itachi began honing his skills tochūninlevel, drawing the attention of Konoha's leaders. Meeting thecriteria, Fugaku allowed him to sit in on clan meetings in theNaka Shrinebasement.[13]Nearly a year since graduating, Itachi had masteredninjutsuto the extent his missions went too easy, thoughYūki Minazukididn't recommend him for theChūnin Exams. After turning eight, as Team 2's genin had distinguished themselves the most during the year, they were tasked with guarding theFire Daimyōduring his annual trip to Konoha. During the mission, the convoy was attacked by amasked individual, who killedTenma Izumobefore Itachi, resulting in him awakening hisSharingan, which he mastered at the same age.[14]In the anime, Itachi accompanied his friend Shisui on a three-part training exercise, only to interrupt a battle between the Third Hokage's Anbu andRoot. After having driven out the Root ninja, Itachi learned from Shisui about having his own sense of morals from various viewpoints instead of one.[15]At age 10, Konoha allowed Itachi to compete in the Chūnin Exams alone, which he passed and became a chūnin.[16] Itachi as an Anbu. At age 11, Itachi joined theAnbuas its youngest member.[17]In the anime, Itachi is assigned toTeam Ro, working alongsideTenzoand withKakashi Hatakeas their captain. During his mentorship, Itachi became acquainted with Kakashi and showed interest in the Sharingan he possessed despite not being an Uchiha. At one point, they both worked together in a two-man squad following an exchange between Konohagakure and thePrajñā Groupof theLand of Woods; killing the latter party after an attempted betrayal.[18]They would work together for two years until Itachi is promoted to a new Anbu team under Danzō's authority.[19] Itachi's accomplishments were a source of great pride for his family, his father viewing him as proof of the Uchiha's future prosperity and his brother viewing him as a model to live up to. Itachi spent a great deal of time with Sasuke, training with him and giving him the recognition their father did not. However, for all the attention he received, few truly understood Itachi,[14]believing his isolation to be a result of the gap between his abilities and theirs and not his dissatisfaction with the shinobi's life of conflict. Eventually, disdain for the villages unfair treatment of the Uchiha clan led them to plan a coup d'état. Fugaku, head of the Uchiha and the coup's chief conspirator, encouraged Itachi's advancement into the Anbu's ranks as a means of spying on the village. Itachi, however, knew an Uchiha coup would lead to intervention from other villages and ultimately start another World War, something he could not support. He instead became a double agent, reporting the Uchiha's actions to theThird Hokageand theKonoha Councilin the hopes it would help them find a peaceful resolution.[20] Itachi accepting Shisui's eye. Itachi shared the burden of betraying his clan with Shisui. But as time went on it became increasingly clear that peace could not be achieved. Shisui intended to use hisKotoamatsukamion the Uchiha's leaders to compel them to negotiate, but his right eye was stolen by Danzō before he had a chance. His own options exhausted, Shisui entrusted his remaining eye to Itachi and begged him to protect the village and their family name before drowning himself in theNaka River.[21]Itachi was anguished by Shisui's death, awakening hisMangekyō Sharingan. The following day some Uchiha, already suspicious of Itachi, accused him of murdering Shisui and staging a suicide; Itachi lost his composure and attacked them, defeating them easily.[22]A rift was created between Itachi and his family, and his warnings to them to reconsider what they were doing fell on deaf ears. At age 12, he was promoted to Anbu Captain, with his publicly disclosed promotion age being 13 due to Danzō's request and Hiruzen's acceptance.[23][24][25]In the anime, Itachi was also given command of his own three-man squad. Itachi would confront his father in theNaka Shrinebasement, who revealed that he had awoken his own Mangekyō Sharingan during theThird Shinobi World War. Having read theStone Tabletand learned the truth of the Mangekyō Sharingan's power, Fugaku calls for Itachi's aid in restraining the higher-ups in a bloodless coup; resisting calls from the clan's more popular favour of controlling theNine-Tailed Fox. Instead, Itachi would return back to theKonoha Councilto report the clan's imminent revolt.[26] Although the Third Hokage still wished to negotiate with the Uchiha, Danzō Shimura believed that there was no longer an outcome that could see the Uchiha clan's survival. He explained this to Itachi and left him a choice: support the Uchiha's coup and have the whole clan, including Sasuke, killed in the ensuing conflict, or accept the assignment to wipe out the clan before the coup started and be allowed to spare Sasuke. Itachi chose his brother.[27]Having made his choice, Itachi was tormented by guilt, emphasized by the belief that Shisui would most likely not forgive his choice to destroy the clan.[28]However, remembering the words of his father to not let other's decide things for his life, he resolved to continue his path. While making final preparations, Itachi discovereda masked mansneaking around Konoha. From observing him, he came to believe the man was trulyMadara Uchihabent on provoking some new conflict. Itachi approached him with an offer: he would assist ""Madara"" with wiping out the Uchiha, taking vengeance against them for abandoning him decades earlier, if Madara would spare the village, to which he agreed.[29] Itachi spares Sasuke after massacring their clan. In one night Itachi andTobislaughtered the entire clan. Itachi took it upon himself to personally execute his parents. Despite his betrayal, they bore him no ill-will, instead telling him in the moments before they were killed that they were proud of him and requesting that he take care of Sasuke.[30]Racked by grief following his actions, Itachi saw Sasuke as the only person suitable to punish him. In order to set Sasuke on this road he cast himself as the villain, done by allowing Sasuke to find him standing over their parents' bodies and usingTsukuyomito torment him with visions of their murders. Sasuke fled, fearing his for his life, but Itachi chased him down to divulge the lie he had concocted: he killed their family to test his mettle and now wanted to test himself against the only remaining challenge to him, the little brother he had never loved. He encouraged Sasuke to become strong enough to kill him and take revenge, and to that end suggested he acquire a Mangekyō Sharingan of his own. Itachi left, but was surprised to find Sasuke already pursuing him with a newly-awakened Sharingan. Sasuke's attempt at vengeance failed and he passed out, but not before seeing Itachi cry with remorse.[31] Afterwards, he disguised acrow cloneas a member ofRootto threaten Danzō he would leak Konoha's secrets to enemy villages if Sasuke was harmed, having realised Danzō could not be trusted to keep his promises. For his final business in the village, Itachi visited the Third Hokage and reported his mission completed, much to the Third's surprise and disappointment. Itachi requested that the Third look after Sasuke, which the Third vowed to do.[32]Itachi left the village publicly a traitor but secretly with a new mission: to infiltrate Tobi's organisation, Akatsuki, and keep it from moving against Konoha.[33]In the anime, Itachi was ambushed by his former Anbu squad under orders from Danzō, only to trick them into killing each other using genjutsu. At some point after joining Akatsuki, he was initially partnered up withJūzō Biwa.[26]While growing accustomed to his new setting and working well with his partner, the duo was eventually given a mission in theLand of Water. After completing it, they were ambushed by ahunter-ninsquad led byYagura. While initially pressed by the perfectjinchūriki, Itachi was able to defeat him withAmaterasu, but not before Jūzō was slain.[5] Itachi effortlessly overpowers Orochimaru. Sometime later, Orochimaru tried to steal Itachi's body in order to gain the Sharingan, but Itachi easily overpowered him, trapping him inside a paralysis genjutsu and severing his left hand to prevent him from dispelling it.[34]In the anime, Itachi expressed his disgust at Orochimaru for his inhumane experiments and was about to kill him when Kabuto saved Orochimaru but they were both forced to leave Akatsuki. Later, Itachi was partnered withKisame Hoshigaki, with whom he bonded over their shared notoriety for killing their own countrymen.[35]To find a replacement for Orochimaru, Itachi helped recruitDeidara, whose art he defeated with his Sharingan'sgenjutsu; Deidara would forever after swear vengeance for the humiliating defeat.[36]In the anime, Itachi also aided in the recruitment ofHidan.Paineventually caught wind of Orochimaru's attempt to destroy Konoha and requested a team to investigate, which Itachi immediately volunteered for out of concern for Sasuke's safety.[37] At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.[38]"
How old was Itachi when he was a seven-year-old?,seven-year-old,Personality,"From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable maturity for his age and knowledge on how to deal with every situation. For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was a rather humble man. Never arrogant about his own abilities nor underestimating others, most things he said would be unbiased and accurate. If an opponent exceeded his expectations or posed a legitimate challenge to him or his allies, Itachi would freely admit it.[39]As a seven-year-old, his reasoning was on par with aHokage. Having studied history, not just of his clan or his village but of the world, he gained a broader appreciation of what was important. Learning so much enabled him to understand how events of the past came to happen and, when he applied that same understanding into the future, he became concerned for where things were going.[40]At the same time, Itachi was still fairly naïve as a child in many real-world scenarios and as such was willing to learn from his peers on how to differentiate situations.[15]He lived at a distance, observing individuals and ideas without getting directly involved so that he could fully understand them.[41] Although this approach prevented him from becoming close with many people, it enabled him to think and act without prejudice or preconceptions, instead evaluating things strictly on their own merits. In the anime, Itachi unintentionally gained many friends and admirers for his genuine concern for others despite his passive nature.[9]He would think about shinobi and origins of the village and its future.[40]For this reason, he never became arrogant about his own abilities or accomplishments; to which, most views or statements he made were usually well-based, seeing the situation for what it was. From this he had no self-righteous loyalty to his clan that wasso common among the Uchiha; though he loved his family and wanted the best for them, he knew there were more important things than the Uchiha's personal aspirations. Itachi's dream was to becomeHokage, though he kept it hidden from others.[16]Itachi was also one of the few villagers of Konoha to hold no grudge against Naruto Uzumaki, believing Naruto to be the greatest victim of the Nine-Tails attack and showed him kindness whenever they met by chance.[42] Itachi crying as he is about to kill his parents. A pacifist at heart, Itachi did not actually like fighting and would avoid it when he could. As such, he preferred to rely on Genjutsu as a first option, ending fights with as little damage as possible. When he couldn't avoid actual combat, he would end the fight as quickly as he could, all the while holding back as much as possible. Despite this, Itachi felt his own needs were secondary to the greater good's and to that end he became ashinobi. He trained tirelessly to improve himself as quickly as he could and subjected himself to all of the shinobi life's inconveniences without complaint for the simple motivation of being useful to others. His commitment borderlined recklessness, due to training privately using extremely deadly methods such as dodging a barrage of kunai in the anime. Being so accomplished as a ninja enabled Itachi to approach problems less violently than others would, satisfying his peace-loving nature. These two extremes of his personality came into conflict as events moved toward theUchiha Clan Downfall; he did not want to harm his family and sought a peaceful resolution, but knew that the path with the least bloodshed would be the clan's extermination. When the Uchiha Clan refused to deter from their plans, Itachi was pushed over the edge and his normally polite attitude to his clansmen became more violent, criticising them openly and lashing out at them for the choices that sealed their fates and his own. Despite this, at his heart, Itachi truly hated what he had to do for sake of preserving peace, trembling with hesitation as he prepared to kill his parents and crying upon doing it. With Izumi, valuing her companionship, and aware of her feelings for him, Itachi opted to put Izumi under a powerful Tsukuyomi to allow her to live the life she'd always dreamed with him, allowing her death to be quick and peaceful. While at heart still a pacifist, in the wake of slaughtering his own clan, Itachi displayed a wrathful and merciless side, particularly to those who wronged or attempted to the people he cared for. In revenge forYashiro Uchiha's cowardly manipulations of his father from the shadows and helping to provoke war against Konohagakure while keeping free of responsibility himself, Itachi used his Tsukuyomi to force him to experience days of torture in an instant after making Yashiro realise how weak he was. Itachi would later use Tsukuyomi, followed by Amaterasu to execute the helpless Root memberSugaruin revenge for Sugaru poisoning Shisui.[42]He even threatened Danzō that he would reveal all the classified information he had on Konoha to foreign forces should the elder renege on his promise of sparing Sasuke, despite the potential damage this could inflict to the village. Upon successfully bringing a near complete extermination of his clan, while maintaining a façade of aloofness, Itachi was completely heartbroken by what he was forced to commit, and during the anniversaries of the massacre, he would be unable to sleep at all. Despite the traumas he endured from killing his own family, Itachi did not blame those among Konoha's leadership who gave him the mission; though he did not trust Danzō on a personal level, he knew Danzō only had the village's best interests at heart. But Itachi – partly out of the necessity of his assignment to join Akatsuki – was greatly changed after the massacre, rarely if ever showing emotion. He became more prone to displays of force and permitted certain violent habits of his partner, Kisame, under the pretence that it furthered Akatsuki's goals.[43]After learning everything that Itachi endured, Hashirama openly considered Itachi a greater shinobi than himself.[44]Itachi could not and would not fully shake his pacifistic ways, and would run from confrontation or rein in Kisame if the likelihood of collateral damage became too high for themselves or others. In addition, Itachi would continue to show his morality at times, as he expressed disgust at Orochimaru's lack of care for human life. While Kisame would sometimes protest, he considered Itachi a good friend and would listen to his instructions. Itachi also had a decent partnership with his previous partner Jūzō, showing respect to him and after his death, placing the remains ofKubikiribōchōin Jūzō's hand. While warning his new partner Kisame that being comrade killers meant they are destined to an unpleasant end, he disagreed with the former's premature determination that they are both terrible people, believing that humans only recognise what they truly are at the end of their lives. Itachi poking Sasuke's forehead, his way of showing affection. Konoha's peace and protection was always forefront in Itachi's mind,[45]but it was his dedication to his brother, Sasuke, that took priority in every situation. From the time of Sasuke's infancy, Itachi tasked himself with looking after him. In the anime, Itachi even correctly guessed Sasuke's gender before his younger brother's birth.[46]They'd spend whole days together in the woods around Konoha having adventures and accomplishing self-appointed missions. When Itachi became an accomplished ninja and took much of their father's attention, Itachi would make special time to fill their father's shoes for Sasuke's benefit, at times even refusing his father's wishes in order to make Sasuke happy. In turn Sasuke wished to be just like his older brother and would often ask Itachi to train him in the ninja arts. Itachi would almost never do so, poking his forehead and promising to train him some other time. Unfortunately, none of these promises were ever kept.[47] Itachi shedding tears as he leaves Sasuke. It was Sasuke's safety that ultimately convinced Itachi to go through with killing the rest of the Uchiha, believing his own damnation was worth it if it ensured Sasuke's survival. Even though he did it for Sasuke, Itachi wanted to be punished for his crimes and selected Sasuke as the one to take vengeance against him. To push Sasuke in this direction, Itachi withheld the true reason for his actions and instead took on the persona of a man who had no love for his younger brother. Per the persona, Itachi cared about Sasuke only because of the eyes that he could take to gainEternal Mangekyō Sharingan. His actions in Akatsuki were meant to reinforce this persona, and whenever he met Sasuke over the years he would taunt his weakness and encourage him to get strong enough to kill him. His plan was that, once he had been killed, Sasuke would be hailed as a hero. Itachi never wanted Sasuke to learn the truth surrounding the Uchiha's massacre, and if he did he hoped the memory of a hateful older brother would cause him to not believe it. Itachi's constant pursuit of peace, coupled with the paramount secrecy of his missions and his capacity to care about those around him, led Itachi to take on every burden himself, believing he needed no help from comrades.[48] After he died and wasreincarnated, Itachi discovered that his plans largely failed; Sasuke is not a hero, he did find out the truth about what Itachi did, and now he aimed to destroy Konoha for its role in Itachi and the Uchiha clan's suffering. He then began to see the flaw in his original plans: he had been trying to manipulate Sasuke rather than be honest with him and trust in his own strength.[49]Acknowledging the mistakes, Itachi was free to be himself instead of the persona he fabricated, being openly kind to others and displaying a dry sense of humour even in stressful situations.[50]He put his trust inNaruto Uzumakito stop Sasuke from proceeding further down the path of darkness, and after Naruto proclaimed that he will stop the war himself, warned Naruto against forgetting the value of his friends like he himself and ""Madara"" did, reminding him how those he loved helped him come so far. Itachi later even showed empathy to his enemy Kabuto Yakushi, likening Kabuto's arrogance and belief in nothing being beyond him to Itachi's own living self, telling him that such a path can only lead to failure, at the same time seeing finally acknowledging his true self for who he is and forgiving himself for his mistakes. Itachi further displayed a reflective side, refusing Sasuke's claims that he was perfect and telling him that perfection can never be obtained by one individual. Itachi came to believe sometimes two people of completely opposite personalities are two sides of the same coin; that when they learn to work together, they can succeed in things they are unable to accomplish alone, a possible reference to how he and Kisame were complete opposites but were capable of compensating for each other's weaknesses. He was also finally open and honest with Sasuke during their final meeting, admitting what he did and even sharing information Sasuke did not already know. He apologised to Sasuke for failing in his responsibilities as an older brother, wondering if being up front with Sasuke from the beginning might have allowed them to avoid the Uchiha's destruction. In their final moments together, Itachi told Sasuke he did not need forgiveness and that he will always love him no matter what.[51]"
How old was Itachi when he graduated from the Academy?,6,Abilities,"Itachi's fire-enhanced shurikenjutsu. Even within the famed and battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi was a genius of such talent,[55]never before seen in Konoha's history.[56]Despite his young age, he became one of the strongest shinobi Konoha ever produced. Well-known for consistently showing prowess far beyond his years, he quickly rose through the ranks; graduated from the Academy in 4 months at age 6, earned the fastest time in completing the second test of the Chūnin Exams while competing solo at age 10,[16]and became an Anbu captain at age 12. He was highly proficient in all three main ninja skill sets, effortlessly learning new techniques from simple observation, and gained praise from allies and foes alike;Orochimaru, one of theSannin, openly admitted Itachi was stronger than him,[57]and Shisui, well-regarded as the strongest Uchiha of their time, viewed Itachi as stronger.[58]Danzō considered him the kind of shinobi one sees maybe once a century.[59]Despite being weakened from illness, while Sasuke had trained under andabsorbedOrochimaru's power, Itachi could have killed Sasuke during their final battle if he wanted to.[60]Even when restraining himself, Itachi still pushed a 3-man team of elite jōnin to their limits.[23]"
How many uses of his Mangeky Sharingan in a single day rendered him unable to even use the Sharingan?,three,Chakra and physical prowess,"Itachi clashing with Naruto. As an Uchiha, his chakra was naturally strong. Even from his youth, Itachi showed very advanced chakra control, able to channel chakra to enhance his strikes, even shattering a boulder large enough to crush several people.[61]However, his actual reserves were affected by his terminal illness. During the Uchiha Massacre, Itachi was able to use hisMangekyō Sharinganfive times without suffering much exhaustion.[62]In the years following, just three uses of his Mangekyō Sharingan in a single day rendered him unable to even use the Sharingan, and then require significant rest to regain his strength. This also prevented him from participating in prolonged battles. Itachi was very skilled withtaijutsu, easily defeating three members of theKonoha Military Police Forceat the age of 11.[63]He had exceptional speed and reflexes, able to compete with Shisui and Naruto while clad with theNine-Tails Chakra Mode, two shinobi well-famed for their speed. His quickness was particularly noted with his hand movements, able to makehand sealstoo fast to be perceived normally; even skilledSharingan-users had difficulty following him.[64]Similar to Shisui, his usage of theBody Flicker Techniquecould move great distances in an instant as if by displacing himself, giving his opponent little chance to react or initiate a counter-attack.[65]Itachi also had remarkable fortitude. Despite spending years afflicted with a crippling disease, he was able to maintain his composure at all times and still battle at near-perfect form."
What did Itachi learn from Shisui to give his opponents less time to react?,His Crow Clone Technique,Ninjutsu,"Itachi's Crow Clone Technique. Itachi couldsummoncrows, which he would typically call forth in flocks to swarm opponents and distract them. He even integrated crows into clones of himself to draw opponents' attention. He likewise could createshadow clonesand from whichdetonatethem for large explosions. Itachi was also well-versed infūinjutsu, able to particularly those that would activate in the presence of a specific person's Sharingan.[66][67]From his time in Anbu, Itachi became proficient in stealth, infiltration, and assassination.[5] As a fully-trained KonohaAnbu, Itachi was skilled with a sword, which was his primary weapon during the Uchiha Clan Downfall. Like many Uchiha, he specialised inshurikenjutsu, which he was especially advanced at. Even as a child, Itachi could perfectly hit an intricate set of eight targets, one of which was hidden in a blind spot, by accurately deflecting his projectile off another one to redirect both projectiles' path in mid-air.[68]His throwing speed was imperceptible, enough to negate the advantages of theSummoning: Lightning Flash Blade Creation.[69]He was equally comfortable withkunai, able to use them to spar with opponents wielding swords. In the anime, he learned advanced sleight-of-hand from Shisui to give his opponents even less time to react.[9] Itachi using the Great Fireball Technique. Itachi'snature transformationsincludedFire,Water,Wind,Yin, andYang Release.[4]As an Uchiha, he had a natural affinity for Fire Release, mastering the clan'sGreat Fireball Techniqueat a very young age. He couldcoat shuriken with fireto increase their offensive capacities.[70]With Water Release, Itachi could perform theWater Dragon Bullet Techniquewithout an external water source,[71]as well as shape existing water intotendrilsto strike his opponents from all directions.[72]"
What did Itachi awaken in the Mangeky Sharingan after witnessing Shisui's suicide?,three spiralling curves around the pupil,Dōjutsu,"Itachi's Sharingan. Itachi awakened theSharinganat age 8,[74]after witnessing his team-mate Tenma Izumo's death, manifesting two tomoe in each eye. Soon after, he fully matured and mastered his dōjutsu. From a young age, he demonstrated skill and power superior to most members of his clan.[75]In the anime, his prowess and exploits with it earned him great fame as ""Itachi of the Sharingan"" .[5]He tended to keep his Sharingan active near-constantly with minimal drain on his chakra levels. The Sharingan allowed Itachi to see the flow of chakra, predict movements, as well as facilitate his use ofgenjutsu. Against other genjutsu users, he couldturn their genjutsu against them.[76]Also with the Sharingan, he could performIzanami, a counterpart to the more dangerousIzanagi.[77] Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan. Itachi awakened theMangekyō Sharinganafter witnessing Shisui's suicide. Its design was three spiralling curves around the pupil. With his right eye he could useAmaterasu, igniting whatever he looked at with black flames that would burn anything, including fire itself, and at will extinguish Amaterasu.[78]With either eye, he could useTsukuyomi, a genjutsu that trapped opponents' minds in an illusory world of his own design — capable of altering their perception of matter, space, gravity, and even time.[79][80][81]Itachi could cast sophisticated and elaborate illusions, forcing the target to experience an entire lifetime in an instant. Likewise, while genjutsu normally cannot kill, with Tsukuyomi Itachi could cause enough mental damage to kill the victim if he wanted to.[82]Even survivors have shown to be hospitalized for extended periods of time. Itachi's armoured Susanoo wielding the Yata Mirror. Having awakened the Mangekyō in both his eyes, Itachi could also useSusanoo. With its simplest manifestations, he could produce extra arms or bones to improve his options in a fight. When used in full, Itachi was surrounded by a spectral warrior that would protect him from damage.[83]In addition to the chakra swords andYasaka Magatamacommon to all Susanoo, Itachi's Susanoo wielded theSword of Totsuka– an ethereal sword with the ability to seal any person it pierced into its gourd—hilt – and theYata Mirror– a shield that was said to reflect any attack by changing its chakra nature to counterbalance an attack. The simultaneous use of both weapons made Itachi's Susanoo essentially invincible.[84] Using any of these techniques required large amounts of chakra, as used too often would deactivate his Sharingan altogether.

What is the name of the crow Itachi planted in Naruto before his death?,Nine-Tails,Fourth shinobi world war: confrontation,"Main article:Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation Itachi and Nagato en route. When the Fourth Shinobi World War begins, Itachi is mobilised with the rest of Kabuto's collection of reincarnated ninja. Itachi is paired with Nagato, who he carries because of Nagato's damaged legs. They discuss Akatsuki and how little they, particularly Nagato, actually knew about the organisation; both were only pawns kept by Tobi because of theirdōjutsu, and now they've been revived so Kabuto can use them for the same reason. Itachi and Nagato are found by Naruto andKiller B. Itachi learns several things as Kabuto forces him to fight them: Naruto'sNine-Tails Chakra Modeindicates he's finally gained control of the Nine-Tails; B's use ofSamehadais proof Kisame is dead; Naruto tells him that Sasuke now works with Akatsuki to destroy Konoha due to having been told the truth of theUchiha Clan Downfallby Tobi, much to Itachi's horror and dismay. Itachi and Nagato continue attacking but give advice to Naruto and B about how to evade them.

What does Itachi remind Sasuke of a mission they went on as children to hunt a boar?,the Impure World Reincarnation,Fourth shinobi world war: climax,"Main article:Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax Itachi and Sasuke join forces. Nagato had been able to locate Kabuto's location while they were together, and Itachi now moves on a direct course there. He inadvertently crosses paths with Sasuke along the way. Feeling he is unworthy of Sasuke, Itachi tries to avoid him and his questions. When Sasuke persists, Itachi admits that he made a mistake manipulating Sasuke along a path that he wanted, which has put Sasuke in a worse position than he ever intended. As they near Kabuto's lair Itachi tries one last time to shake him, only to be disappointed when Sasuke joins him shortly after he confronts Kabuto. Sasuke moves to kill Kabuto, but is blocked by Itachi, who explains that Kabuto must be kept alive if the Impure World Reincarnation is to be broken. Sasuke offers to help on the condition that Itachi will finally talk to him afterwards. Itachi agrees. Itachi attacks Kabuto. Kabuto obscures his vision to prevent being caught in a genjutsu and attacks. Itachi and Sasuke block with their Susanoo, only to find that they have lost track of Kabuto. Itachi realises that Kabuto has achievedSage Modeand quickly defends Sasuke before he can come to harm in Kabuto's sneak attack. Itachi reminds Sasuke of a mission they went on as children to hunt a boar, which they reenact with their Susanoo against Kabuto. Kabuto avoids them and commandeersSasuke's sword, which he uses to attack Itachi. Itachi takes the sword back from him and uses it to cut off the tip of one of Kabuto's horns. Kabuto tries to turn Sasuke against Itachi, pointing out all the lies and distrust Itachi has been showing Sasuke for years. Itachi admits his faults, but promises to tell Sasuke something after he's performed hisIzanami. Kabuto is confident that he cannot be defeated since they can't kill him and because of the precautions he's taken to avoid genjutsu. Hemanipulates the caveto confine them and usesDNAto perform a variety of other ninja's long-range jutsu, trying to create an opportunity to access Itachi's head and regain control of him. Sasuke becomes increasingly earnest to kill Kabuto, but Itachi pleads for him to wait until Izanami is ready. Under Itachi's control, Kabuto releases the Impure World Reincarnation. While Itachi and Sasuke deal with Kabuto's recreation of Orochimaru, KabutobisectsItachi. Itachi's reincarnated body regenerates and he uses Sasuke's sword to cut off even more of the same horn as before. This creates a sensory loop independent of vision that traps Kabuto in eternal battle; that is Izanami. Kabuto has the chance of escaping Izanami by accepting the fate he now tries to fight by taking on others' powers, Itachi's gift to him because of their perceived similarities. He raises thebrillethat cover Kabuto's eyes and uses a genjutsu to make Kabuto perform the hand seals that will end the Impure World Reincarnation. Itachi imparts his final words to his brother. While Kabuto performs the hand seals, Sasuke tells Itachi that he won't forgive Konoha for coercing Itachi the way that he was and that he will continue to conspire against the villages despite Itachi's wishes. Itachi listens without response. When he is engulfed in light and the Impure World Reincarnation begins to break, he faces Sasuke and admits to everything Sasuke has been told about him, even imparting some of his own memories to Sasuke to fully dispel the lies he's told. He reaches for Sasuke, seemingly meaning to poke his forehead again, but instead gives Sasuke a head bump, symbolising he no longer saw Sasuke as a child, but an equal. He tells Sasuke that he wants no forgiveness and promises that he will love Sasuke no matter what he decides to do. His reincarnated body dissolves and his soul returns to theafterlife."
What does Sasuke do after he defected from Konoha and left to train under Orochimaru?,he defected from Konoha and left to train under Orochimaru— propelling him along the path towards Itachi's death,Legacy,"By his own design, Itachi had a profound influence on Sasuke’s life. His instructions on the night of theUchiha Clan Downfallfor Sasuke to gain the power necessary to defeat him caused Sasuke to isolate himself from other people and avoid companionship. When Sasuke realised that he was getting attached to the members ofTeam 7and, from his perspective, failing to get stronger because of them, he defected from Konoha and left to train underOrochimaru— propelling him along the path towards Itachi's death. Following the brothers' battle, Itachi's plans started to fail due to the interference ofTobi, who refocuses Sasuke's hatred that Itachi had engineered for himself, to be used against Konoha, turning Sasuke into a criminal against Itachi's intentions. Itachi is able to make amends with Sasuke upon hisreincarnation, using his Sharingan to convey his memories to his little brother so that he could understand why Itachi chose the path he did. He also wiped Sasuke's prejudices clean and encouraged him to start deciding things for himself. Itachi's eyes would prove to be of immense importance for Sasuke, as not only did it grant Sasuke the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan, but Sasuke would later awaken the Rinnegan with one of Itachi's eyes. Upon learning the entire truth about Itachi, Sasuke regains the great admiration he had for him when they were children and follows in his brother's footsteps. He does not want to see Konoha, the village Itachi sacrificed so much for, destroyed and therefore works against Tobi and Madara to end theFourth Shinobi World War.[89]He also sees the reason in Itachi's decision to make difficult choices and be hated for them, and for that reason gives himself the task after the war is concluded to become the world's darkness, using his power to force peace and unapologetically kill any that threaten it. Though this is again a great divergence from Itachi's plans, another of Itachi's plans redeems him:Naruto, at Itachi's insistence, eventually convinces Sasuke of the errors he has made without killing him after their final battle. In the war's aftermath, Sasuke adopts Itachi's habit of poking others' foreheads as a sign of affection, in particular his wife,Sakura Haruno, and their daughter,Sarada. He also had a habit of neglecting his daughter in favour of his duties of protecting the village and her, although he realises this mistake later on and chose to spend time with his family before continuing his mission. Sasuke would continue to protect the village for many years to come — ultimately causing Itachi's wishes for his brother to finally be realised. In the years following the World War, Naruto attempted to restore some of Itachi's honour by telling the world of Itachi's actions during his period of reincarnation. Without mentioning the truth about the ""crimes"" he committed while alive, Naruto gave Itachi's name as someone who supported him. Though not an easy thing to accept, no one challenged Naruto's word on the matter.[90] Itachi's influence also extended beyond Sasuke:Danzō Shimura, despite his difference of opinions with Itachi, believed him an unsung hero of Konoha who worked selflessly for the village's good; Naruto is reminded by Itachi that the Hokage's strength comes from their acknowledgement by others, and thus he must never forget those who helped him become strong; the fiveKage, despite not knowing about Itachi's involvement, hailed him as the world's saviour for dispelling the Impure World Reincarnation technique;[91]Kabuto Yakushiremembered who he truly was as a result of Itachi'sIzanamiand, inspired by him, resuscitated Sasuke when he was on the verge of death. In the anime, Hiruzen realised kind-hearted people should never be in the Anbu because of the nature of their missions. After the Uchiha Clan Downfall, Hiruzen was determined not to do the same with Kakashi and chose to retire him as an Anbu and made him commander of a team of genin in hopes it would help restore his light and kindness and eliminate his darkness. Itachi had an influence on one of Orochimaru's experiment subjects,Shin. Shin became intrigued by the Uchiha clan, especially Itachi, and adopted the clan name and customary garb for himself. It was because of his fascination of Itachi that Shin held a grudge against Sasuke for causing his older brother to die, and attempted to kill him in revenge. However, Sasuke noted that Shin's social darwinism and warmongering goals indicate he did not understand Itachi at all."

After putting a tea kettle to boil and setting bread in a toaster, he grabs a carton of eggs from the fridge and attempts to cook one sunny-side up, only to find his first attempt foiled by an errant piece of eggshell on the egg. Further attempts yield the same results, with various things going wrong with the eggs, such as the yolk breaking, Itachi's sweat getting onto the eggs, and so on. Itachi even resorts to making a plate of scrambled eggs, although after a moment of thought he dismisses the idea and starts again."

Ichigo arrives to take overfighting Shrieker.[83]When Rukia releases him from his body, he, injuring Shrieker, notices small creatures nearby, and is told they spit out explosive leeches. After asking Shrieker if he was the one who killed the child's parents, which he confirms, Ichigo, catching one of the leeches, slams it into Shrieker's mouth. When the Hollow refuses to trigger them, Ichigo, ripping out its tongue, stabs his sword into Shrieker's leg.[84]Asking him how it feels to be unable to move or fight and if he can savor what it is like to be murdered, Ichigo cuts through his head, and Shrieker is pulled intoHell. After Rukia explains about Hell, she tells the Plus they will send him to Soul Society, and Ichigo says he might see his mother there.[85] Ichigo questions the use of theArtificial Soul. The following day, Ichigo, noting Sado's memory has been erased, receives aGikonganfrom Rukia, who, after explaining its purpose, forces him to try one. Unconvinced by theartificial soul's personality, Ichigo is forced to leave it in his body when they receive an order from Soul Society.[86]After defeating the Hollow, a concerned Ichigo, rushing back, sees his body jump out of an upstairs window and run away extremely fast. As they chase after him, Rukia tells him it must be aMod soul.[87]As Rukia explains what she means to an angry Ichigo, he, asking if Rukia is alright with the idea of the Mod Souls being created and killed all for Soul Society's convenience, wonders how the Mod Soul must feel about being persecuted and gaining his body.[88]Receiving a warning about a Hollow, they, hurrying to its location, find the Mod Soul is fighting it. Rushing to his aid, Ichigo reminds him he is using his body. As the two continue arguing, they defeat the Hollow together. WhenKisuke Urahararemoves the Mod Soul from Ichigo's body, Ichigo, asking him what he is going to do with it, asks who he is. When Rukia gives the Mod Soul to Ichigo, he thanks her for not throwing him away.[89] Ichigo and family plan their trip toMasaki's grave. After failing to find a body to place the Mod Soul in, Ichigo, placing him in a plushie, decides to call himKon. On the 16th of June, Ichigo, woken by Kon, scrambles to hide him and Rukia as Yuzu comes into the room to say Mizuiro is waiting for him. Apologizing to Mizuiro, he, noting his memory has been erased, remembers Rukia had told him Urahara must have worked hard. As Rukia leaves, Ichigo, complaining about Isshin not waking him up as usual, notices the date.[90]That night, the Kurosakis hold a family meeting to discuss their trip to Masaki's grave the following day. Ichigo asks Rukia if he can take the day off from the Shinigami work, as it is the day Masaki was killed.[91] Rukia asks about Masaki's death. On the 17th of July, the Kurosaki family visits Masaki's grave. Annoyed that Rukia followed them, Ichigo, becoming angry when she asks if Masaki was killed by a Hollow, notices the same girl he saw the night Masaki died, and, running after her, tells Rukia he killed Masaki.[92]At Masaki's grave, Ichigo, watching his family's antics, reflects on his mother's death and its impact on his family.[93]Sensing the Reiatsu of a Hollow, Ichigo realizes the twins are easy targets.[94]As the Hollow attempts to eat Yuzu, Ichigo, arriving, cuts the twins free. Demanding to know why the girl he saw when Masaki died is there, he asks if she is controlled by the Hollow.[95]When Rukia tells him the Hollow is calledGrand Fisherand it uses the girl as a lure to trick and devour Humans who have high levels of spiritual power, Ichigo, realizing Grand Fisher killed his mother, lunges at it. Stopping Rukia from interfering, he, insisting on fighting alone, instructs her to mind his sisters.[96] Grand Fisherattempts to manipulate Ichigo. Struggling against Grand Fisher, Ichigo is subjected to the Hollow'sTranscribeability. Transforming his lure into an image of Masaki, Grand Fisher explains about his ability.[97][98]As he pierces Ichigo's chest, Ichigo, stabbing the Hollow's chest. grabs his arm, saying he has finally caught him, and slashes open his chest.[99]Transferring its form into the lure, Grand Fisher escapes. As Rukia tries to convince Ichigo he cannot fight him any more, he, insisting he can and the Hollow is still not dead yet, soon collapses.[100]Using most of her strength to heal his stomach wound, Rukia leaves his other injuries. When Ichigo awakens, in his Human body, in great pain, Rukia reminds him the wounds his soul receives will show up when he returns to his body. When Ichigo asks her if he lost, she tells him he won, since the Hollow fled and nobody died. Saying Grand Fisher is not dead, Ichigo walks off.[101] Isshingives Ichigo some advice. When Ichigo, at Masaki's grave, apologizes for not being able to avenge her, Isshin notes the time has gone by quickly, and it has already been ten years since Masaki died. When Ichigo corrects his error, Isshin states he was ""so close"". When Ichigo loudly complains about this, Isshin says Masaki can rest easily if she sees him being so lively. When he starts smoking a cigarette, Ichigo says he thought he quit smoking when Karin and Yuzu were born. Isshin explains he smokes on this one occasion, as the only time Masaki complimented his looks while they were dating is when she saw him smoking.[102]When Ichigo asks why nobody blames him for her death, Isshin, dismissing the suggestion, says Masaki would be mad at him, and she would gladly die to protect her child. Reminding Ichigo he is the one the woman he loved gave her life to protect, he, telling him to live his life well, leaves. Asking Rukia if her powers are returning, Ichigo asks her to allow him to remain a Shinigami for a while longer regardless. He says he wants to become stronger so he can defeat Hollows, protect those who are targeted, and defeat Grand Fisher; otherwise, he will not be able to face Masaki.[103] Orihimeapologizes to Ichigo. While Yuzu and Isshin are watchingDon Kanonji'sGhost BustTV program one Wednesday evening, Ichigo asks Karin why she is not watching it with them. She tells Ichigo she can see spirits about as clearly as he can, and is not interested in the ghost show. Remembering she saw the Hollow who attacked the house when he first met Rukia, Ichigo realizes she might be able to see Shinigami too. The next morning at school, Orihime, performing Don Kanonji's pose as Ichigo arrives in class, asks him to do the pose with her. As Ichigo's friends all do the pose, Ichigo tells Keigo he is not going to the live recording ofGhost Bustat the abandoned hospital in Karakura, despite his attempts to convince him to go.[104]The following Wednesday, Ichigo accompanies his family to watchGhost Bustbeing filmed. When Orihime apologizes to him for trying to get him to do Don Kanonji's pose, he, telling her it is okay, reveals Keigo and Mizuiro know he despises it, but yet still do it anyway. When asked why he came, he, stating Isshin and Yuzu are huge fans of the show, says they would look pitiful if just the two of them went. When Orihime tells him he is so kind, Ichigo dismisses it as normal.[105] Ichigo fends off theHollow. Telling him he must be tired from his dual life, Rukia instructs him to use this chance to relax. Surprised she is concerned about his health, Ichigo, asking if there really is a spirit in the hospital, says the Shinigami would have dealt with it already. Rukia says it is likely to be aJibakurai, a soul on its way to becoming a Hollow.[106]When Ichigo asks Rukia if they should performKonsōon it to prevent it from becoming a Hollow, she says it takes months to turn into a Hollow. She says to do it after the show to avoid trouble in case of a struggle, but Ichigo is unconvinced. Meanwhile, Don Kanonji jams his staff into the partially open hole in the Jibakurai's chest.[107]As Ichigo tries to stop him, he is caught by security. Urahara frees Ichigo's Shinigami form from his body, allowing him to knock Kanonji away from the Jibakurai. As Ichigo realizes the medium can see him, the Jibakurai vanishes in an explosion.[108]As Kanonji promises to send Ichigo to heaven too, Rukia shouts at him to look up, where they see the spirit reforming into a Hollow on top of the hospital. As Ichigo and Kanonji bicker, the Hollow charges at them. Ichigo fends off its attack, and when the Hollow gets its head stuck in a wall, Ichigo drags Kanonji inside.[109][110] The Demi-Hollowis defeated by Ichigo. Ichigo insists they stay inside to avoid the audience being caught up in the fighting. When the Hollow attacks again, Ichigo's Zanpakutō becomes stuck in the ceiling. Ichigo realizes he never thought about the corridors being too confined to use his sword in. When the Hollow glues Ichigo's hands together, Kanonji, jamming its mouth open with his staff, frees Ichigo's blade.[111]When Ichigo's sword becomes embedded in the Hollow's shoulder, it drags him up to the roof. Freeing himself, Ichigo takes advantage of the open space to defeat the Hollow. When Kanonji praises him, Ichigo, telling him to stop his antics, explains it is the same spirit Kanonji thought he had sent to heaven. Stating regretting it is pointless, as he did not know, Ichigo directs Kanonji to the crowd. Kanonji thanks him, complimenting his courage, quick wits, and strength, and asks that they work together in the future. When Ichigo agrees to help him once in a while, Kanonji forces him to take a Don Kanonji fan club card, signed ""to my #1 pupil"".[112][113] The following day, Rukia helps Ichigo and his friends get out of trouble for their actions at the abandoned hospital when they are brought before the principal andKagine, who states their escapades were broadcast live nationwide.[114]That afternoon, Ichigo, answering the door, meets Don Kanonji. Closing and locking the door, he demands to know how he found out about his house. When Kanonji reveals he invited Rukia along, Ichigo realizes it was her who told him where he lived. Seeing Kanonji, Yuzu knocks Ichigo over while opening the door. When Rukia'sDenreishinkialerts her to a Hollow, they rush off to fight it.[115] After numerous incidents of arriving at the supposed site of a Hollow attack, only to find there is no Hollow, Ichigo and Rukia bicker. When Ichigo asks if there is another Shinigami defeating the Hollows before him, Rukia tells him Shinigami are strictly sorted, and it should not be the case.[116]Ichigo tries to keep away from Rukia at school to avoid the rumors since their appearance onGhost Bust. While discussing his high grades with Keigo and Mizuiro, Ichigo notes his orange hair causes him a lot of trouble, as older students pick on him and teachers watch him closely, so he studies so the school does not complain about him. Rukia drags Ichigo off, prompting him to complain about the rumors regarding them. When she tells him to complain later, as there is a Hollow, Ichigo tells her he will not forgive her if it is not there this time, but they find nothing.[117]After another incident following school, Ichigo tells Rukia to do something about the problem as she drags his body from its hiding place. The pair are approached byUryū Ishida, who asks Ichigo if it is correct he can see spirits, which Ichigo denies is even possible. When a new Hollow appears, Uryū, killing it, introduces himself, saying he hates Shinigami and Ichigo.[118][119] Uryūgrabs Ichigo's redspirit thread. At school, Ichigo, reflecting upon his encounter with Uryū, wonders why he would say such things to a complete stranger and why Uryū was angry. Realizing he cannot remember his full name, Ichigo lists off possible names out loud. Overhearing him, Orihime, stating Uryū is in their class, takes him to the handicrafts club to show him Uryū. When Orihime asks what happened between Ichigo and Uryū, Ichigo dismisses it as no big deal.[120]After school, Ichigo follows Uryū as he leaves. Asking him if he intends to follow him home, Uryū notes he had noticed him spying on him from the classroom doorway. When Ichigo applauds him, Uryū states it is due to Ichigo's inability to restrain his spiritual power, and he lacks the ability to senseReiatsu, as evidenced by him not noticing Uryū until that day. Revealing he noticed Ichigo's unusually high spiritual power and his acquisition of Shinigami powers, Uryū, inviting Ichigo to fight him, says Shinigami are unnecessary in the Human World.[121] Though Ichigo ridicules the idea, Uryū succeeds in convincing him to fight him, and he uses Kon to free his Shinigami form. Using some Hollow bait to cause Hollows to gather in Karakura Town, Uryū states the one who defeats the most Hollows within twenty-four hours wins. When Ichigo, angered by this, demands to know why he is exposing the town's residents to such danger, Uryū tells him not to worry, as they will kill all the Hollows.[122]As Ichigo tries to make him undo it, Uryū tells him Hollows will soon flood the town, and he should try to protect as many people as possible. When Uryū tells him Hollows tend to prefer people with high spiritual power, Ichigo runs off to find Karin.[123]After slaying his third Hollow and saving a pair of Pluses, Ichigo, struggling to remember where Karin is, sends Kon to get Rukia's Denreishinki to aid in reacting to the Hollows.[124]Defeating the Hollows between the Kurosaki Clinic and the last place where he saw Karin, Ichigo thinks it should be safe for her now.[125] Ichigo confronts Uryū. Having found Uryū, Ichigo bickers with Kon when he arrives. Unable to attract their attention by shouting, Uryū fires an arrow at Ichigo, who, blocking it, insists it is a battle between him and Uryū, and the amount of Hollows they beat is irrelevant. As Kon points out there is a large crack forming in the sky, and Uryū begins firing arrows into the group of Hollows, Ichigo tells him there are too many, and they need to come up with a strategy. Asking him if he is afraid, Uryū charges towards the Hollows. When Rukia explains the fall of the Quincy at the hands of the Shinigami, Ichigo, running after Uryū, attacks several Hollows around him.[126][127]When Ichigo, telling Uryū he does not know or care about whether the Shinigami or Quincy were right, expresses frustration at his methods, Uryū tells him he thought the Shinigami were correct until hissenseiwas killed in front of him. Telling Ichigo of his sensei's attempts to convince the Shinigami to work together with the remaining Quincy and how he died fighting a group of huge Hollows without achieving that goal, Uryū says he must prove the strength of the Quincy to the Shinigami. Pointing out his sensei's wish was to work together, Ichigo, asking if he will do that now, says fighting back to back is the best way to deal with the situation.[128] Ichigo attacks theMenos Grande. As the two begrudgingly work together, Ichigo, telling him his approach to their fight is endangering the people he wants to protect, says he will not forgive him for that. They agree to beat each other up after the Hollows have been dealt with, but as they prepare to attack a horde of Hollows, aMenos Grandeappears. AsUruru Tsumugiya,Tessai Tsukabishi,Jinta Hanakari, and Urahara arrive to fight the Hollows, Urahara tells Ichigo to concentrate on fighting the Menos.[129]Seeing its size, Ichigo, questioning if it is in fact a Hollow, is shocked to see it eating the nearby Hollows. Saying there is no way they can figure out how to fight such a monster and they will have to simply cut it repeatedly until it succumbs to its injuries, Ichigo, charging towards the Menos, attacks its leg, but is knocked back by the unfazed Menos.[130] Uryū's plan is put into motion. Noticing Ichigo's power flows into his bow when he touches it, Uryū, planning to fire an enlarged arrow at the Menos, tells Ichigo to increase his power to maximum. Stating he never controls his energy output, Ichigo says it must be at maximum all the time. When the Menos starts to charge aCero, Ichigo, rushing towards it, blocks the Cero with his Zanpakutō. His power increasing as he resists the Cero, Ichigo repels the attack, injuring the Menos in the process.[131]As the Menos retreats, Ichigo, claiming victory, collapses as his Zanpakutō begins to destabilize. Noting it will explode, Uryū begins to dissipate the energy by absorbing it and releasing it by firing arrows into the sky, injuring himself. Uryū tells him to make sure he lives so he can beat him later.[132]The following day, when Rukia tells Ichigo not to pay attention to Uryū's injuries, Ichigo denies being worried. Later, when he overhears Keigo telling Mizuiro he saw Uryū talking to himself the previous day, believing it to be related to a theater, Ichigo is thankful Keigo is an idiot. Asking Uryū to join them for lunch, Ichigo later regrets it, due to the atmosphere which prevails over their meal.[133] Ichigo finds Kon tied up. That night, Ichigo, taking the leftovers from dinner to give to Rukia, finds she is gone.[134]At 2:00 a.m., Ichigo, wondering whether she is going to return that night, notes it would be nice not to have Shinigami duties to carry out for once. Hearing a muffled noise, Ichigo finds Kon gagged and tied to the back of the toilet bowl. When Ichigo asks why he was tied up, Kon, saying Rukia is in big trouble, shows Ichigo a note she left on his desk. Confused by the message, which tells them she has to leave and they should go into hiding instead of looking for her, Ichigo decides to change into his Shinigami form and find her. Realizing he cannot change form without Rukia, Ichigo demands a reluctant Kon change him into a Shinigami. Appearing at the window, Urahara changes him into his Shinigami form.[135] Renji Abaraiunleashes hisShikaiagainst Ichigo. As LieutenantRenji Abaraiattacks Rukia, Ichigo, arriving, attacks him.[136]When Renji notes the size of Ichigo's Zanpakutō, Ichigo replies he thought it was large compared to Rukia's, but there had not been anyone else to compare it to. Realizing he is the Human who took Rukia's Shinigami powers, Renji, attacking him, asks Ichigo what the name of his Zanpakutō is. When Ichigo, stating he has not named his sword, asks if they actually give them names, Renji activates hisShikai, surprising Ichigo with the change of form of his Zanpakutō. Leaping into the air, he slashes Ichigo's shoulder.[137] Ichigo's final blow to Renji is stopped. As Renji, explaining about the Shikai form of Zanpakutō, moves to attack him, Rukia attempts to stop him so Ichigo can flee, but Ichigo's Reiatsu increases, and he, injuring the surprised Renji, quickly overwhelms him. As Ichigo attempts to end the fight, Byakuya severs his sword's tip, leaving Ichigo stunned. As he prepares for Byakuya's subsequent attack, Byakuya, appearing behind him, stabs him.[138]Falling to the ground, Ichigo, wondering whether he was attacked from the front or from behind, is stabbed again by Byakuya.[139]As Byakuya and Rukia talk about Ichigo, he, grabbing Byakuya's leg, tells him not to talk about him as if he is dead. As Byakuya tells him to let go, Ichigo instructs the captain to look at him when he is talking so he can hear him. Kicking Ichigo's hand away from her brother, Rukia, telling him he should know his place, tells Byakuya she is ready to leave. As Ichigo protests, Renji tells him to stop making things worse. When Rukia tells Byakuya there is no point in deliberately killing Ichigo, as he will soon stop breathing on his own, Ichigo asks if this is a joke, prompting Rukia to state if he tries to follow her, she will never forgive him. As she tells him to conserve what energy he has left so he may live a moment longer, Byakuya, acquiescing to Rukia's request, states Ichigo should die shortly due to his injuries, but if he does survive, he will no longer possess any Shinigami powers. As they leave, Ichigo, noting he cannot move or speak, reflects upon how he came to protect Rukia, but instead she protected him again.[140]As Ichigo contemplates his injuries in the rain, Urahara approaches him.[141] Ichigo awakens with anunexpected bedfellow. When Ichigo awakens in Urahara's shop, Urahara tells him his wounds are not yet fully healed, and if he moves too much, he may die. When Ichigo asks him about Uryū's condition, Urahara states Uryū's injuries were treated on the spot, and when he left, he was worried about Ichigo, stating Ichigo was the only one who could beat the Shinigami and save Rukia. When Ichigo says he cannot do anything, as Rukia has been taken to Soul Society and he cannot follow, Urahara reveals he can send Ichigo there if he trains with Urahara for the next ten days, revealing Soul Society typically allows a grace period of one month before executions. Saying Ichigo will die if he goes there in his current condition, he reveals he purposely allowed Ichigo to fight Renji and Byakuya so he would realize this after having fought them himself. He states it will take seven days to open the gate to Soul Society, leaving Ichigo with thirteen days in Soul Society to rescue Rukia. Though unsure if he can become strong enough in ten days, Ichigo agrees to Urahara's deal.[142] Orihime asks Ichigo about Rukia's disappearance. Giving Ichigo some pills to take every hour, Urahara, saying he will recover from his injuries by dinnertime, sends him to school for the final day of the term. At school, Ichigo notes how nobody appears to remember Rukia. AsMisatodismisses the class for summer, Ichigo, noting Uryū's absence, thinks he would remember Rukia. As he walks home after dismissing Keigo's invitation to spend the holiday with him, he meets Orihime, who, asking him where Rukia is, notes everyone has forgotten about her, but she believed Ichigo would know. Explaining the situation to her, Ichigo is surprised she can see his Shinigami form. Noting Ichigo has already made up his mind to rescue Rukia, Orihime, telling him to go save her, insists she does not want her friend to die either. Thanking her, Ichigo, going to theUrahara Shop, shows Urahara his healed wounds. Telling Urahara he told Isshin he would be sleeping over at a friend's house, he asks Urahara to teach him well.[143] Ururu Tsumugiyaattacks Ichigo. InUrahara's training area, Ichigo's soul form is freed from his body, and he finds it difficult to move. Urahara reveals Byakuya destroyed the source of his power, leaving him without any Shinigami powers, and he must restore these in order to fight the Shinigami. Explaining aboutReiryoku, stating the more one's Reiryoku rises, the sharper the movements of their spiritual body become, he says if Ichigo can manage to move even better with his spiritual body than he can with his mortal body, they will have completely recovered his Reiryoku. Urahara hasUruru Tsumugiyaattack Ichigo, and she lunges at him, creating a large cloud of dust and debris.[144]Emerging from the dust, Ichigo runs away from Ururu after another near miss. Realizing he is able to run away from her, Ichigo attempts to dodge her attacks directly. Successfully dodging, Ichigo attacks Ururu by trying to hit her headgear lightly, believing the weight difference will do the rest. When he hits and cuts her face, Ururu kicks him into a rocky outcropping. Catching Ichigo before he hits it, Tessai cushions him from the impact.[145] Tessaisevers Ichigo'sChain of Fate. Congratulating him on clearing the lesson, Urahara asks if Ichigo is still having trouble breathing or moving, which he is not. As Urahara says he has successfully recovered his spirit energy, and the soul tends to gain the Reiryoku faster when it is in danger of being destroyed, Tessai, cutting Ichigo'sChain of Fate, pins him to the ground.[146]Telling him the chain has already begun to corrode from the severed end, Urahara states if it reaches his chest, Ichigo will become a Hollow, but he can avoid this by becoming a Shinigami instead. The point of this lesson, which Urahara calls ""Shattered Shaft,"" is to restore Ichigo's Shinigami powers. Dropped to the bottom of a shaft, he is bound with aKinspell, and Urahara tells him to scale the vertical sides of the deep shaft.[147]Revealing there is a gas at the bottom of the shaft which speeds up the corrosion process to at most 72 hours, he tells Ichigo to become a Shinigami and climb out of the hole before that, or else he will become a Hollow, and they will destroy him.[148] After the corrosion of the chain's fifth link, Ichigo notes the process alternates between a few minutes of painful corrosion and a few hours of dormancy. Only able to attempt to escape during the dormant phases, Ichigo unsuccessfully tries to run up the wall. Asking him if he is hungry,Jinta Hanakariexplains a soul feeling hungry is a sign they will soon become a Hollow. Later, as Ichigo wonders how long he has been in the hole for and how he can get out of it, Jinta runs down the shaft's wall with a platter of fruit for him. When Ichigo, denying he is hungry, says the chain is still long, Jinta reveals it has been seventy hours since he entered the shaft, and the final corrosion phase is stronger than the earlier ones. As the remaining length of the chain begins to corrode, a hole opens in Ichigo's chest, and a mask begins to form over his face.[149]Urahara explains the mask forming before his body reforms shows Ichigo is resisting the transformation.[150] Ichigo awakens in his inner world. Awakening inside his consciousness, Ichigo sees amanstanding on a building. Surprised that Ichigo does not recognize him, the man says his name, but Ichigo cannot hear it. Stating it is sad, the man asks how many times he has to tell him his name before he is able to hear it, as he thought nobody in this world knew him better than Ichigo. When Ichigo falls from the building, the man, following him, states he should not worry, as Shinigami control death. As Ichigo tells him he is not currently a Shinigami, the man, telling him to focus theReishiaround him underneath his feet to stand on, urges Ichigo to remember a time when he stopped in mid-air as a Shinigami. He tells Ichigo Byakuya destroyed the powers given to him by Rukia, but Ichigo has his own Shinigami powers, which were hidden deep in his soul and awakened by Rukia's power. As the world crumbles around him, he instructs Ichigo to find it.[151] Ichigo emerges from the Shattered Shaft. With the buildings of his inner world dissolving into countless boxes, Ichigo, falling through a fissure into water, wonders how he can find his own powers. Remembering Uryū stating Shinigami have redReiraku, he uses this to find a box containing a Zanpakutō's hilt. Telling him this time he ought to hear his name, the man urges him to take the hilt.[152]As Ichigo struggles to pull out the Zanpakutō, back in the shaft, the Kidō restraining Ichigo breaks apart. When Tessai activates the next stage of the Kidō,Bankin, an explosion erupts from the shaft. As the smoke clears, Ichigo, wearing a Hollow mask and Shinigami clothes, uses his still broken Zanpakutō to smash the Hollow mask. Congratulating him on his success, Urahara says he is now a complete Shinigami. Having sworn to kill Urahara when he got out of the shaft, Ichigo hits him in the eye with the sword's hilt. Urahara starts the third lesson, which is simply to knock the hat off of Urahara's head. As Ichigo proposes a five minute time limit, Urahara draws a blade from within his cane.[153] Ichigo andKisuke Uraharaclash. Overwhelming Ichigo, Urahara, revealing his sword is a Zanpakutō, activatesBenihime'sShikai.[154]As Ichigo remembers Renji using his Shikai during their fight, Urahara, telling him every Zanpakutō has a name, cuts through the remains of Ichigo's blade until just the hilt remains, saying if he continues to fight with just the hilt, he will kill him. As Ichigo, thinking he is going to die, runs away, Urahara continues to attack him. Ichigo sees the man from his inner world again, who, asking why Ichigo ran when he has not yet called him, reveals his name isZangetsu.[155]Stopping in his tracks, Ichigo, turning towards Urahara, calls out Zangetsu, activating his Shikai. Looking at the new form of his Zanpakutō, Ichigo, telling Urahara he might not be able to hold back, swings Zangetsu at him, who usesChikasumi no Tate. As the dust settles, a hat-less Urahara, stating he would have lost an arm if it were not forChikasumi no Tate, says he did not expect so much from one swing.[156] After completing Urahara's training, Ichigo has a relatively normal summer holiday while waiting for the gate to Soul Society to be opened. On the first of August, Ichigo and his friends gather for a fireworks festival, where they catch up. Isshin and the twins, running up to Ichigo, knock him down a bank. When Ichigo asks if they are drunk, Isshin reveals a juice seller used wine to dilute their juice instead of water. Telling the group they saved a seat on the opposite bank of the river that morning, Isshin heads off with the girls and several of Ichigo's friends.[157]Later that night, after complaining to a drunken Isshin about having to carry his sisters, Ichigo tells him he will be leaving soon, and he might not be back until the summer vacation ends.[158] Isshin presents Ichigo with a protective charm. Seven days after completing his training, Ichigo is summoned to the Urahara Shop. As he leaves, Ichigo says goodbye to his sisters. Isshin lends him an amulet, which he claims Masaki gave to him, stating it will bring him good fortune. On his way to Urahara's, Ichigo meets up with Orihime. Revealing he did not know she was going until Urahara mentioned it, Ichigo asks her if she is sure about it. When they arrive at the shop, they find Sado waiting for them, and Ichigo, asking where Uryū is, says he had heard he was coming too. When Uryū, arriving in a Quincy outfit, promises to show Ichigo how powerful he has become, Ichigo criticizes him for walking the entire way there wearing that outfit. Interrupting them, Urahara invites the group inside.[159] TheKōtotsuchases Ichigo's group through theDangai. In the underground training area, Urahara, revealing theSenkaimonthey will be using to enter Soul Society, removes Ichigo's Shinigami form from his body. As the others examine his body, Ichigo complains about them touching it freely. Explaining how the Senkaimon works, Urahara says it will only stay open for four minutes. If they do not reach Soul Society in that time, they will become trapped in theDangai. When Yoruichi tells them only those who are truly ready for the task can go, Ichigo says everyone gathered there has already made their decision and will go to Soul Society. When Yoruichi tells him they will never return if they lose, Ichigo states they simply have to win. When the Senkaimon opens, Ichigo tells Kon to take care of his family. Entering the gate, Ichigo, Uryū, Orihime, Sado, and Yoruichi appear in the Dangai.[160]As they run, Uryū's cape is caught by theKōryū. Ichigo is warned not to use his Zanpakutō, as the Kōryū will trap it and he will not escape. After Sado frees Uryū, the group are chased by theKōtotsu, and Orihime uses her shield to protect them from it, propelling them through the exit and into Soul Society.[161]"
What does Isshin sew to Ichigo's school uniform?,protective charm,Arrancar arc,"After Ichigo returns from Soul Society, Isshin attacks him in bed.

The yakuza says if he does not kill Ichigo within fifteen minutes, he will be trapped there permanently. After giving a brief explanation of Fullbring, Riruka leaves Ichigo, who, reflecting on what she said, thinks about how Kūgo transformed his pendant into a sword, concluding he should focus on something he regularly has with him.

Ichigo wonders if the power will help him get his Shinigami powers back.[320]At Ichigo's behest, Riruka restores him to his normal size. Briefly hearing a voice coming from the badge which he recognizes as Rukia's, Ichigo wonders what is happening.[321] Listening as the yakuza tries to extort money from Riruka, Ichigo notes he looks exactly like the doll he was inside. When Ichigo asks if he is to stay for further training, he is told Fullbring puts more strain on the body than can be felt. Kūgo advises him not to push himself, as his body will fall to pieces if he wears himself out. Saying a few more days without his powers should be bearable after all this time, he promises to call him when he has recuperated. As Sado and Ichigo walk to Sado's home, the latter tells Ichigo Orihime has been bringing him leftover bread everyday lately. Ichigo tells him she is worried about him, and he should call her. As Sado goes to give half of it to Ichigo, he, noticing something wrong with her Reiatsu, statessomething has happened to her.[322] Sado and Ichigo rush to Orihime's side. When Ichigo tries to call Orihime, Sado tells him not to, as it could distract her and lead her to her death. He says he cannot quite locate Orihime's exact location, but Ichigo can tell by the direction they are going she is at her apartment.[323]Arriving to find Orihime kneeling in front of her door, they ask her if she is alright. Grabbing her shoulder, seeming distracted, Orihime, noticing Sado and Ichigo, asks why they are there. Hearing their explanation, Orihime tells them nothing happened, and she was with a friend before going into her apartment. As they leave, Ichigo asks Sado about Orihime. Stating he was probably sensing things wrong, Sado tells Ichigo not to worry.[324] Realizing Sado and Orihime will not tell him anything, Ichigo, going to the Xcution hideout, explains the situation, telling them he believes Orihime was attacked by the same person who attacked Uryū. When Kūgo andJackie Tristanboth suspect it isShūkurō Tsukishima, Ichigo asks who this is, and Kūgo reveals Tsukishima is a Fullbringer and the former leader of Xcution, who came up with the idea to give their powers to a Substitute Shinigami.[325]When they did so, he, killing the Shinigami and those who gave him their power, disappeared. Showing Ichigo a Substitute Shinigami Badge, he tells him he believes Tsukishima wants to keep Ichigo away from them, and is using his attacks on Uryū and Orihime to get his attention. He tells him to go home until they are ready for thenext stage of training. While walking the streets, Ichigo, spotting Isshin meeting with Urahara in an alley, hides. When they leave, Ichigo, contemplating Kūgo's warning about Urahara, wonders if he should follow them, but decides not to. Later, Ichigo returns to Xcution's hideout, where Riruka places him inside a fish tank to fight Jackie.[326] After an exchange of words between the pair, Jackie activates her Fullbring,Dirty Boots, and they begin to fight.[327]Telling Ichigo he is too lax, and he cannot take his time getting into a battle, Jackie warns Ichigo because he is in a living body, he will die if he keeps taking her attacks with his body. Ichigo fires an energy blast at her, only for Jackie to easily shatter it. Revealing he knows his attack's weakness, Ichigo uses Fullbring to increase his speed and attacks her. After being asked who taught him to fight, Ichigo explains he first learned from Urahara, but he learned from his battles as time went on, saying even though he was only a Shinigami for a brief time, he probably has more experience in battle than Xcution.[328] Ichigo's badge starts to go berserk. As Reiatsu from Ichigo's badge begins to engulf his right arm, Ichigo begins to tire. When Jackie says they will abort the training, as Ichigo's Fullbring is going berserk in a way she has never seen before, Ichigo is adamant in continuing. As Jackie calls for Kūgo to retrieve Riruka to end the training, Ichigo, pinning her to the ground, says his Fullbring is not going berserk and has always been like this. He believes this is his badge's way of telling him to hurry and get his Shinigami powers back soon. Believing it is too dangerous to continue, Jackie decides to stop him by force.[329] Ichigo clashes with Tsukishima. When Tsukishima arrives at the Xcution headquarters, he cuts through the fish tank, and Ichigo emerges, engulfed in Reiatsu shaped similarly to his Shinigami shihakushō.[330]Asking who he is, Ichigoclashes with him. When Sado attacks Tsukishima to protect Ichigo's new powers, Ichigo, learning he was being protected from the truth, realizes Tsukishima attacked both Uryū and Orihime. Managing to surprise Tsukishima in the subsequent clash, Ichigo is swiftly overwhelmed. Protecting him, Kūgo states he cannot let them fight yet.[331] Ichigo attacks Tsukishima from behind. When Ichigo refuses to cooperate, Kūgo, knocking him to the ground, tells him he is not fine if he can be dropped in his real body. As Ichigo tries to resume fighting, he is stopped by Sado, who tells him Tsukishima is too far ahead of him, and he cannot win in his current state. Disregarding this, Ichigo attacks Tsukishima, who, commenting on his rate of evolution, states he is becoming closer to the heights of his previous powers. Using his Fullbring,Yukio Hans Vorarlbernaseals Ichigo, preventing him from interacting with Tsukishima.[332][333][334]Later, in Xcution's back-up hideout, Yukio frees Ichigo, who asks what happened with Tsukishima. When Kūgo states he has fled for now, Ichigo asks what Kūgo is worried about. Stating if Tsukishima wanted to harm Xcution, he could have kept going, but it seems his objective is Ichigo, Kūgo tells Yukio to help with Ichigo's training. When Ichigo asks if it will be a live battle, Kūgo, saying that is what seems to work best with him, states he willfight Ichigo himself.[335] Yukio loads Ichigo and Kūgo into his console. Seeing this, Ichigo realizes this is what happened to him before on the rooftops, and Kūgo explains Yukio's Fullbring. Activating his own Fullbring, Kūgo, saying it would be great if they had rules like a video game, requests Yukio give them six HP each, prompting six crosses to appear above their heads. When Kūgo asks if Ichigo needs a tutorial, he, saying he understands, activates his Fullbring, and they charge at each other.[336]Arriving inside Yukio's game world to find a badly injured Ichigo lying on the ground, Orihime begins to heal him. When Ichigo guesses Sado called her, Sado, arriving, confirms this, saying he knows Ichigo did not want to get Orihime wrapped up in this, but they will need her.[337]When Kūgo, growing impatient, asks Ichigo if he is ready to fight, Ichigo says yes, ignoring Orihime's protest. After Orihime blocks Kūgo's attempted attack, they resume their fight.[338] Following Orihime's arrival, Ichigo's movements become sharper. As he attacks Kūgo up close to counter the range of his sword, Kūgo, fending him off, injures Ichigo's leg.[339]As they fight, Ichigo notes he cannot feel anything from Kūgo's sword, comparing it with his battle with Gin Ichimaru. He notes while Tsukishima did not look at him, he felt his killing intent. He wonders if he cannot feel anything because they are not using Zanpakutō, or if it is because he does not fully trust Kūgo. Slashing Ichigo's eyes, Kūgo notes when Ichigo lost his powers, he also lost his resolve.[340] Ichigo's Fullbring is completed. Blind and confused, Ichigo, demanding to know what Kūgo is doing, states he does not trust him, as he is not helping him as he had promised he would. Kūgo states their deal was to get his Shinigami powers back, and if he did not trust him, he should not have agreed to his training. When Yukio prevents Orihime from interfering, an enraged Ichigo, attacking, tries to dodge Kūgo's attacks by sensing the presence and sound of his opponent, but Kūgo, further injuring him, leaves Ichigo lying on the ground, impaled with his sword. Walking away, Kūgo, telling Ichigo he is going to kill Sado and Orihime, further taunts him. Struggling for a moment, Ichigo, reflecting on his inability to see, move, or speak, sees a white shape in the darkness, realizing he is beginning to see Kūgo's Reiatsu. As Ichigo begins to manifest a new form, power explodes from him. Putting his life on the line to control the explosion, Kūgo expresses his pride in Ichigo's accomplishment, stating his villain act is not the best, and welcomes Ichigo to Xcution.[341] Ichigo tests out his completed Fullbring. After completing his Fullbring, Ichigo is put through a new training regiment to increase his stamina to meet the demands of using Fullbring. When Kūgo asks if Ichigo saw something when he completed his Fullbring, Ichigo is shocked he knows this. Kūgo says Ichigo saw him bathed in Reiatsu, which is why he cut Ichigo's eyes, as that is proof Ichigo is beginning to regain his Shinigami powers. Kūgo explains when Ichigo lost his Reiatsu, a tiny portion accumulated in a single location inside of him over time, which is why they used the Reiatsu flowing from his badge to jolt that awake. He says all that is left to do is to beef up his new body and powers, and his Fullbring and Shinigami powers will fuse, giving Ichigo a power transcending that of a Shinigami. Taking his badge, Ichigo, trying out his new Fullbring, leaves Yukio's Fullbring, thanking him. Yukio states only 90 minutes have passed, thanks to his Fullbring's abilities. Going home, Ichigo is met at the door by Yuzu, who says they have a surprise guest. He finds Tsukishima, whom Yuzu calls cousin Shū, sitting on the couch. Tsukishima greets Ichigo.[342] Ichigo flees his home in horror at Tsukishima's manipulation. Watching in disbelief, Ichigo, grabbing Tsukishima, demands an explanation for why he is there. As Karin and Yuzu try to pry him off Tsukishima, the doorbell rings. Asking Yuzu to get it, Tsukishima says it must be Keigo and the others. As Tatsuki begins to lecture Ichigo on staying out so late, Tsukishima, telling Ichigo he called everyone, starts to call Sado and Orihime as well. As he is on the phone, Ichigo attacks him, prompting Tatsuki to berate Ichigo for attacking his relative. As Ichigo states she is wrong, everyone asks why he is acting the way he is. Fleeing his house, Ichigo, wondering whether what is going on is Tsukishima's ability, runs into Ikumi, who takes him to her store to let him calm down and talk about it. As Ichigo decides against telling her about Shinigami and Hollows, as it would make her uncomfortable, Tsukishima arrives at the store, and Ichigo, fleeing once again, says he needs someone in their right mind. Finding him, Kūgo says everyone in Xcution has fallen for Tsukishima's trap.[343] Kūgo takes Ichigo to a location, which he says no members of Xcution know about, to discuss what has transpired. When Ichigo wonders why everyone is acting the way they are, Kūgo tells Ichigo that, thanks to information Sado provided about Tsukishima's attack on Orihime and with what has transpired, his ability may be inserting himself into people's pasts. When Ichigo asks if it would stop if Tsukishima were to die, Kūgo, telling Ichigo he does not know, asks if Ichigo could kill him despite this. Finding them, Yukio takes them to Tsukishima's mansion.[344] Ichigo in complete Fullbring form, begins his assault on Tsukishima. As Ichigo, angrily rushing towards Tsukishima when he spots him, reaches for his badge, Kūgo, stopping him, warns Ichigo if he is correct about Tsukishima's ability, they will be in trouble if he is cut even once. Inviting them inside, Tsukishima says he only wants to talk. As a reluctant Ichigo enters the mansion, his family and friends, greeting him, tell a shocked Ichigo he should be happy Tsukishima is not angry, urging him to apologize. Kūgo tells him not to worry, because even though they view Tsukishima as a friend, they still view Ichigo as their friend. It is too much for Ichigo to handle, and he flees the room. He wants to kill Tsukishima, but he cannot fight him where his friends and family can be dragged into it. Going upstairs, he comes across the other members of Xcution. As Tsukishima appears behind Ichigo, Kūgo appears, having destroyed the stairs so Ichigo's family and friends cannot follow, and tells Ichigo he can nowfight without holding back. Ichigo activates his Fullbring, and while Tsukishima is activating his, Ichigo cuts off his left arm. As Tsukishima expresses his surprise at Ichigo mastering his Fullbring in such a short time, Ichigo tells him he arrived to kill him. As Sado bursts through the window, he and Orihime shield Tsukishima.[345] Ichigo tries to attack but is stopped by Orihime'sSanten Kesshun. As Orihime heals Tsukishima's arm, Ichigo is left unable to believe Sado and Orihime have become the same as the others. As Both Orihime and Sado say Ichigo was able to save Rukia and defeat Aizen because Tsukishima helped him do so, Tsukishima, appearing behind Ichigo, asks him if he understands, but Ichigo tries to attack him.[346]As Tsukishima reveals the ability of his Fullbring,Book of the End, is to modify the past of those affected by it, Ichigo tries to attack him, but Orihime stops him with herSanten Kesshun. As Sado, trying to attack Ichigo, says he did not become strong to fight with Ichigo, he attacks again, and Ichigo is pushed outside from the force of the attack. As he, wondering why things turned out this way, says he only wanted to protect his friends, he asks what he got his powers back for. When Tsukishima appears above Ichigo, he charges at him.[347] Kūgo protects Ichigo from Tsukishima's attack. As they fight, Tsukishima gets behind Ichigo to attack him, but Kūgo takes the attack instead.[348]When Ichigo rushes to see if Kūgo is alright, Kūgo insists he is a comrade. When Uryū arrives, Ichigo questions his allegiance. Not wanting to fall for a trap, Ichigo is hesitant to listen to Uryū. As Uryū tells Ichigo it was Kūgo who attacked him, Kūgo attacks Ichigo, who asks if Kūgo was turned by Tsukishima's powers. Revealing their allegiance was a ruse, and Tsukishima had just returned him back to normal by cutting him a second time, Kūgo, merging the Substitute Shinigami Badge he had with his sword, tells Ichigo it is time to relieve him of his Fullbring, stabbing Ichigo through his chest.[349] Kūgo reveals he was the one who actually attacked Uryū, and ordered Tsukishima to cut him, making them ""enemies"" who betrayed each other. Kūgo further states Tsukishima's ability prevented Ichigo from suspecting him. As Kūgo withdraws his blade from Ichigo's chest and Ichigo's Fullbring disappears, Ichigo thinks about how hard it was for him to go seventeen months without any power, and when he thought he found a way, he was so happy he could protect his friends again. When a distraught Ichigo asks Kūgo to give his power back, Kūgo states it was the power he gave to Ichigo, and it belongs to him. Kūgo says he will spare his life, and he should thank him.[350] Ichigo realizes that it was Rukia who stabbed him. After Tsukishima and Kūgo leave, Ichigo isstabbed in the back by Rukiawith a special sword containing the Reiatsu of the Gotei 13's senior officers and other Shinigami. Ichigo emerges from the resulting explosion with a new Shinigami outfit and a slightly altered Zangetsu, ready tofight. Greeting Ichigo, Rukia, momentarily berating him, reveals Urahara told her about Tsukishima's ability. Reassuring him about this, she explains about the sword Urahara made to restore Shinigami powers to Ichigo. Returning, Kūgo, disputing this, is cut off by the arrival of more Shinigami. Rukia tells Kūgo he only stole a small portion of Ichigo's power, which had Ichigo's Fullbring, and Ichigo's Shinigami powers well up from deep inside; he could never take that from him. Ichigo fires aGetsuga Tenshōat Kūgo.[351][352] Ichigo fires Getsuga Tenshō at Kūgo. As Ichigo'sGetsuga Tenshōmisses Kūgo and Kūgo tries to retreat, Ichigo, stopping him, attacks Kūgo with anotherGetsuga Tenshōbefore asking if it was a crime to transfer Shinigami powers to a Human. As Renji reveals Captain-Commander Yamamoto ordered all captains and lieutenants to put their Reiatsu into Urahara's sword to help bring back Ichigo's Shinigami powers, Hitsugaya tells him he did this because Ichigo was able to change Soul Society through his actions, and he should accept it proudly. As Ichigo notices Kūgo emerging from the dust below, Hitsugaya tells Ichigo Yamamoto also gave the order to stop the original Substitute Shinigami, Kūgo Ginjō.[353]When Ichigo is confused about this, Hitsugaya, reminding him of when Ukitake gave him his badge, tells Ichigo the Substitute Shinigami law was created solely because of Kūgo before stating they need to focus on Kūgo right now. Thanking Ichigo, Kūgo says if he had not taken his powers, he would have been dead by now.[354] After Kūgo grants the other members of Xcution part of Ichigo's Fullbring, Ichigo attacks them all. Using his Fullbring, Yukio, deceiving Ichigo, protects the Fullbringers from harm. Reminding Ichigo they received his Fullbring powers, which allows for them to wear their powers as a mantle, he says with Ichigo's help, hisInvaders Must Dieis now able to influence the world outside his console.[355]After Yukio uses his Fullbring to split everyone up into individual rooms, Ichigo and Uryū find themselves facing Kūgo in a replica of Karakura Town, an environment which Kūgo says he picked so Ichigo could fight easier. When Ichigo asks if Uryū is hurt, the Quincy, saying Rukia healed him, apologizes to Ichigo, saying when he first saw the Substitute Badge, he had thought there were other Substitutes before him. He thought if the previous one was alive, they would have told Ichigo, and if he was dead, they would have said why, leading Uryū to believe Soul Society did not know. Kicking Uryū, Ichigo tells him it does not matter, as they could not have done anything anyhow, and he would have forgotten in a few days. The two momentarily bicker before returning their attention to Kūgo.[356] Ichigo falling victim to Kūgo's Getsuga Tenshō. While Ichigo and Uryū fight Kūgo, they begin hiding from him. When Ichigo asks Uryū if he has a plan, Uryū tells him he was not trying to come up with one, but rather he was observing Kūgo's Reiatsu. Abruptly leaving to confront Kūgo, Ichigo attacks him with aGetsuga Tenshō, but Kūgo, cutting through it with his sword, attacks him with aGetsuga Tenshōas well, surprising Ichigo. Uryū explains Kūgo, in addition to taking his Fullbring and Reiatsu, must have taken Ichigo's full abilities as well.[357]As Kūgo and Ichigo continue to fight, Kūgo asks him what he is fighting for, which confuses Ichigo. Kūgo confirms Tsukishima is dying, and if a Fullbringer dies, all traces of their ability disappear. He asks Ichigo what he is fighting for, but when Ichigo does not answer him, Kūgo informs him of an enemy heshouldbe fighting.[358] Ichigo grievously wounds Ginjō as the two battle in Bankai. When Ichigo dismisses this as an attempt to shake his resolve. Kūgo, stating the Substitute Shinigami Badge is given out whether the Substitute in question is beneficial to Soul Society or not, explains it has no authority, and its true purpose is to observe and restrict Ichigo's Shinigami powers while he has it with him. When Kūgo says this scheme was designed by Ukitake to control Substitute Shinigami, an enraged Ichigo releases his Bankai, which shatters the pocket dimension.[359]Dismissing Kūgo's words, Ichigo says he knew Ukitake was not trying to mislead him. After Kūgo activates his Bankai, the two clash.[360][361]Eventually, Kūgo's sword breaks, and he, badly injured, slumps to the ground, unable to continue. As Tsukishima tries to attack Ichigo, Riruka blocks the attack with her body instead.[362]Sometime after the fighting ends, he is at Urahara's shop, waiting for Riruka to wake up so he can make sure she is okay. He tells Riruka none of the other Fullbringers have been found.[363] Ichigo greeted by the captains upon his return to Soul Society. Ichigo goes to Soul Society to acquire Kūgo's body so he may bury it in the Human World. Upon arriving at the First Division, he finds the captains waiting for him. He is told to go inside the building by Kensei, whom he is surprised to see in a captain's uniform. After informing Yamamoto of his request, he dismisses Captain Hirako's words about forgiving Kūgo, stating his friends and family are back to normal, and calls Kūgo a ""mere Substitute Shinigami."" Yamamoto notes he must have thought carefully about using that phrase. Afterwards, Ichigo is asked about his Badge, but he, stating he trusts them, keeps it.[364]"

When Quilge traps him in a Reishi prison, Ichigo loses contact with Akon and is unable to free himself.[380][381][382][383]Eventually, Akon frees Ichigo, who enters Soul Society and travels to a heavily wounded Byakuya's location. After Byakuya begs him to save Soul Society, Ichigo confrontsYhwach.[384]Upon learning Yhwach is the one who ordered the destruction of the Seireitei, an enraged Ichigo attacks him, only to be taken down with ease.

Afterwards, Ichigo returns to Nimaiya's palace, where he chooses an Asauchi who resembles Ichigo's inner Hollow.[399]Traveling to Nimaiya's forge,[400]Ichigo watches as Nimaiya's bodyguards help him forge Ichigo's new Zanpakutō. When he questions Nimaiya about the nature of his forging, Ichigo learns the being who claimed to be Zangetsu is actually his Quincy powers and heavily resembles Yhwach from 1000 years ago.[401]Entering his inner world, Ichigo demands answers from the being he knows as Zangetsu, who reveals Hollow Ichigo is Ichigo's true Zanpakutō, whom he has been mostly suppressing. Afterwards, he allows Ichigo to access the full power of his true Zanpakutō.[402]In the real world, Ichigo grabs his new Zanpakutō while it is being forged, which Nimaiya allows. After a burst of heat, Ichigo stands with his new Zanpakutō, which is now comprised of two distinct blades, and acknowledges both his Quincy powers and the real Zangetsu as being his Zanpakutō.[403] Afterwards, Ichigo joinsIchibē Hyōsubeat the latter's temple. There, Ichibē brings up the extensive damage that Soul Society has suffered, and calls this pathetic because a thousand years of peace have clearly made the Shinigami weak, though Ichigo points out that the Royal Guard merely watched as this happened. In response, Ichibē asserts that part of their duty is to watch in addition to training Ichigo, whom he informs that the Wandenreich are sure to come again in the near future. Affirming this, Ichigo bows, thanks Ichibē for his help, and begins to walk out of the temple. However, when Ichigo tells an inquisitive Ichibē that he is returning to Soul Society to help theGotei 13before the next attack, Ichibē merely questions if he is that eager to die and declares that Ichigo has no chance of winning against Yhwach right now, to Ichigo's shock. As Ichigo prepares for the training by taking off hisShihakushōand setting down the blades ofZangetsu, Ichibē reiterates that Ichigo cannot defeat Yhwach in his current state and declares that he must surpass the existence of a Shinigami, claiming that Ichigo will only ever be a Shinigami if he merely hones his Zanpakutō skills. Ichibē takes Ichigo to theIrazu Sandō, a dimension that Ichibē claims is a sacred place which not even the Royal Guard can enter without the permission of theSoul Kingand that he will test Ichigo to see if he is worthy of surpassing the existence of Shinigami.[404] Ichigo momentarily gains four additional pupils in each eye. As Ichigo walks through the corridor of theIrazu Sandōhe begins to struggle and wonders how it can be so heavy in here and forces himself to keep going.[405]Ichigo continues walking toward the gate at the end of the path despite the immense pressure building with every step. However, upon taking a step, Ichigo experiences rapid and inexplicable visions of a man in a pool of Reishi, which he is left bewildered by. Attempting to ignore this and continue progressing, Ichigo receives the same visions again at a slower rate, letting him see a man stabilizing Reishi in four separate pools with arrows, having his arms and legs cut off, and ultimately being sealed in a crystal to become the Soul King, leaving Ichigo speechless while the pupils of his eyes are surrounded by four additional, mirage-like pupils in the corners.[406] As Ichigo wonders what is happening while, he experiences the same visions as before alongside glimpses of the original captains of the Gotei 13. Ichigo stops walking as he is surrounded by surging golden, green, blue, and red Reiatsu that begins suffusing his body. Suddenly, Ichigo envisions his body swelling up from the power entering him and screams in pain as four additional pupils appear in his eyes again, only for it to subside once he raises his wooden sword above his head. In the aftermath, an exhausted Ichigo slowly walks forward and passes through the gate at the end of the path, taking him to the interior ofSenjumaru Shutara's palace.[407] Ichigo's new outfit for returning to Seireitei.

WhileGiselle Gewelle,Liltotto Lamperd,Candice Catnipp, andMeninas McAllonare trying to finish off the defeated Kenpachi Zaraki, Ichigo arrives in Seireitei and goes to Kenpachi's side, commenting on Zaraki's condition and that he came there to help him.[411]Candice attacks him, but Ichigo grabs her arm and throws her into a building before repeating the process with Liltotto, Meninas, and Giselle.

As Ichigo turns to face it, Yhwach begins speaking to him and notes that Ichigo broke through all the 72 barriers between Soul Society and the Soul King Palace on his way back down to Seireitei. He states that it will take 6,000 seconds for them to fully close again, causing Ichigo to realize what he is planning. When Ichigo leaps forward, the various Sternritter try to stop him. However, Renji intervenes and tells Ichigo to go to Yhwach, prompting Ichigo to leave as the Sternritter are intercepted by several other Shinigami.[416]As Ichigo rushes toward Yhwach, Uryū fires aHeilig Pfeilat him and tells him to go home. Ichigo expresses shock and wonders why Uryū is there. When Uryū states he cannot defeat Yhwach, before unleashingLicht Regenon him. However,Santen Kesshunblocks the barrage as Orihime and Sado emerge from aGarganta. As Uryū, Yhwach and Haschwalth vanish, Ichigo continues to call out to his friend.[417]Afterwards, upon seeing Ichigo's distraught expression, Sado throws him into a building and demands to know what he is doing. He points out how Uryū must have thought deeply about his decision, which calms Ichigo down and they discuss how they can take Uryū back. They are interrupted by Urahara, who offers to take Ichigo to the Soul King Palace.[418] Ichigo talks to Orihime about the time they entered Soul Society to rescue Rukia. Urahara takes Ichigo and his friends to the basement of the 12th Division, where a single use replica of Kūkaku's cannon has been built by Mayuri. After a moment of collecting their thoughts, Ichigo, Orihime, Sado, Ganju and Yoruichi are launched towards the Soul King Palace.[419]When Orihime reminisces about the time they entered Soul Society to rescue Rukia with Uryū alongside them, Ichigo assures her that they will defeat Yhwach and take Uryū back.[420]Upon arriving at the palace, Ichigo spots Ichibē's head lying on the ground in front of him. He hears Ichibē's voice telling him to call his name and does so, causing Ichibē to reappear unharmed. After explaining how this happened, Ichibē asks Ichigo to stop Yhwach from killing the Soul King as Ichigo and his friends rush toward the main palace.[421] Ichigo attacks the Soul King against his will. Ichigo and the others arrive at the main palace, where they confront Yhwach.[422]When Ichigo tells Yhwach that they have come to stop him, Yhwach reveals that he saw it already, prompting Ichigo to ask him what he means and why his eyes have changed. After Yhwach explains his ability to see the future and reveals he has already attacked the Soul King, Ichigo attempts to help the king, but is surprised when his right side is enveloped inBlut Veneveins upon touching Yhwach's sword. Yhwach explains how the Quincy blood within Ichigo's body will never tolerate the Soul King's existence and invites him to watch the destruction of Soul Society as Ichigo slashes the Soul King diagonally across the chest.[423] Ichigo attacks Yhwach. Ichigo wonders why he cannot let go of the sword and why he was forced to attack the king, prompting Yhwach to explain how he transferred the Reiatsu still present in his sword to him, which Ichigo's blood reacted to. Upon hearing this, Ichigo manages to dispel the veins covering his arm and grabsZangetsubefore attacking Yhwach, who effortlessly blocks him while proclaiming that there is no point in fighting him anymore because Soul Society will collapse regardless of what happens to him.[424] Ichigo prevents Yhwach from destroying the Soul King. WhenMimihagiappears and stabilizes the Soul King, Ichigo looks at it in shock.[425]Yhwach attempts to destroy both of them, but Ichigo stops him, allowing Yoruichi to move in and begin the process of replacing the Soul King. Ichigo states he is here to protect Soul Society, Hueco Mundo, and the Human World, prompting Yhwach to demand to know if Ichigo thinks only he can do this. Proclaiming that he cannot simply sit by even if he is replaceable, Ichigo blasts Yhwach with aGetsuga Tenshōand tells Yhwach it does not matter if Yhwach's blood runs in his veins because he will not do Yhwach's bidding.[426] Yhwach blasts Ichigo away. Yhwach claims that he has never tried to make Ichigo do his bidding, prompting Ichigo to ask him what he means. Yhwach claims that all of Ichigo's fighting and growth up until now have been preparing him for killing the Soul King and that this has all benefited him because they share the same blood. Ichigo angrily attacks Yhwach and proclaims he still intends to stop him, only for Yhwach to ask him if his resentment toward him is truly justified. When Uryū arrives and shoots Yoruichi in the shoulder, causing her barrier to shatter, a shocked Ichigo demands to know what he just did before being blasted away by Yhwach. After throwing Yoruichi out of the palace, Yhwach places his hand on the Soul King, but Ichigo attempts to attack him, only to be distracted by another attack from Uryū. As Yhwach rips Mimihagi off of the Soul King, Uryū tells Ichigo not to interfere, prompting Ichigo to demand to know what he is doing.[427] Ichigo faces off against Uryū. When Uryū tells them to not move if they do not want to be shot, Ichigo attempts to move, prompting Uryū to shoot his sword and clash with him. During this bout, Ichigo is struck by aHeilig Pfeilbut is protected byBlut Vene, which Uryū is stunned by. Ichigo asks Uryū if he does not know what will happen if Yhwach succeeds in killing the Soul King, but Uryū reveals he already knows, causing Ichigo to again question his motives, but Uryū simply claims that being a Quincy is his reason. Uryū then reveals hisVollständig, shocking Ichigo.[428]Refusing to accept Uryū's reasoning, Ichigo once again engages him in battle. Successfully deflecting Uryū's attacks, Ichigo repeatedly tries to reason with his friend, but Uryū states that he now thinks that Quincy and Shinigami co-existing and cooperating is impossible. Ichigo fires aGetsuga Jūjishōat Uryū, who counters withSternenstaub. While Uryū's attack is overpowered, Ichigo'sGetsuga Jūjishōdeliberatly misses Uryū, who chides Ichigo for being naive. Coming to a final stand, Ichigo raises his sword to attack Uryū but is shot with aHeilig Pfeilthrough his torso, causing him to fall off the palace.[429]Lille Barrofires anotherHeilig Pfeilafter him.[430]Ichigo manages to catch and destroy theHeilig Pfeilas Orihime catches him, herself, Sado, and Ganju withSanten Kesshun, which is grappled by Yoruichi, who reels them up to one of the floating cities. However, Kon suddenly bursts out of Ichigo's pocket in his muscular form, causing Ichigo to fall back and hit his head on Orihime, knocking him out.[431] Grimmjow confronts Ichigo. Later, Yoruichi wakes Ichigo up. After remembering what happened, Ichigo finds and grabs Kon, whom he begins tormenting, before being interrupted by Yoruichi, who asks him and the others if it is time to take their revenge. Ichigo wonders how they are going to get back up to the palace, before having aGargantaopen behind her to reveal Grimmjow, whose arrival shocks Ichigo.[432]Grimmjow greets Ichigo and before noting the scars he gave Ichigo have already healed. Drawing his sword, Grimmjow claims he has been waiting for all this time to get some payback as Ichigo picks upZangetsu, but they are interrupted whenNelliel Tu Odelschwanckleaps over Grimmjow and tackles Ichigo. Nelliel explains to a shocked Ichigo that Urahara made her an armband that allows her to maintain her adult form.Riruka Dokugaminesummons them in to a nearby black box created byYukio Hans Vorarlberna. After everyone enters, Yukio locks the box as Ichigo demands that Yoruichi explain everything to him. Yoruichi reveals how they are going to use aGargantato infiltrate the palace.[433] Ichigo arrives at theWahrwelt. After Yoruichi explains how they are getting to the palace by using a device she put near the Soul King as a destination point, Ichigo confirms that he understands. Soon after, he asks Grimmjow why he is helping them, and is amused when Grimmjow claims he is only doing so because there will be no chance to fight him if Yhwach destroys everything.[434]As Ichigo and the others prepare themselves, they are interrupted by Yukio informing them that he will not be leaving the box to fight. When Ganju confronts him over this, Ichigo stops him and agrees with Yukio's decision before telling Riruka to stay behind as well in order to protect Yukio. Ganju notes that he has grown a lot, only for Ichigo to wonder what he means. Upon reaching the palace, Ichigo watches as theGargantaopens to reveal that the palace has been reshaped into theWahrweltby Yhwach.[435] Ichigo and his allies begin moving toward it while discussing their inability to create Reishi footholds. While Ichigo expresses confusion at Yoruichi's comparison of him toher brother, Grimmjow decides to move ahead without the group, prompting Ichigo to attempt to stop him. Grimmjow finds and attacksAskin Nakk Le Vaarup ahead, prompting Ichigo to express irritation at him attacking without a second thought.[436]They lose track of Grimmjow, which annoys him greatly. Ichigo then tells his allies to split up and look for Grimmjow.[437] Askin defeats Ichigo. Soon afterwards, he encounters Askin and demands to know what happened to Grimmjow. After hearing that the former Espada has been dealt with, Ichigo prepares to attack Askin, but is interrupted when darkness suddenly surrounds them. Ichigo then begins to wonder nervously if the Reiatsu he is sensing really belongs toShunsui Kyōraku.[438]Ichigo loses his battle with Askin and is found lying face down on the ground by Orihime and Sado. Ichigo warns them to stay back as Sado attacks Askin.[439]Yoruichi intercepts Askin, and Ichigo eventually manages to stand up. Yoruichi tells him to go along with the others until she catches up with them, and Ichigo complies, but tells her to watch herself. Ichigo, Sado, and Orihime then run away from the battlefield.[440] Ichigo encounters Uryū. They reach the palace and confront Uryū.[441]Ichigo wonders what is going on with Haschwalth's eyes as the Grandmaster walks up to him and Uryū. Ichigo watches in shock as Haschwalth orders Uryū to prove his loyalty by attacking him, and clashes with his friend. Ichigo asks Uryū what he is trying to do and why he joined the Quincy so he would at least know Uryū's motivation and bring him back to their side. After forcing them away from Haschwalth, Uryū tosses Ichigo hisSun Key, which could teleport them to the Human World, and tells him to take his friends and leave as he would stay behind and take downWahrwelthimself using a plan he had already begun. Ichigo argues against this plan, saying that they just needed to take down Yhwach, but Uryū says it is impossible and it is up to him to destroyWahrweltas his own Reiatsu is essential to the plan. Uryū tells Ichigo to go, but they are confronted by Haschwalth, who knew Uryū's plan.[442] Ichigo and his friends are attacked by giant statues. As Haschwalth approaches them, he reveals that he destroyed theSun Gateleading to the Human World. Uryū realizes that as long as Haschwalth possessesThe Almighty, Yhwach is vulnerable and tells Ichigo to go to the highest point ofSilbernto confront Yhwach while he deals with Haschwalth. Ichigo initially protests but duly heads off with Orihime and Sado. They climb up the stairs, they are suddenly ambushed by large Quincy statues. Ichigo pulls Orihime away from an attack, and Sado blocks another attack aimed at them. The clash causes part of the walkway to fall away, separating Ichigo and Orihime from Sado. Sado says that he will stay and take care of the statues. Ichigo understands his friend's resolve and continues heading upward with Orihime.[443] Ichigo confronts Yhwach. They reach the entrance to the throne room and Ichigo tells Orihime that he is counting on her to act as his defense.[444]Ichigo approaches Yhwach, who can see his monstrous Reiatsu emanating from his body, and Yhwach wonders what Ichigo will do. Ichigo gets annoyed, knowing that Yhwach can see his next move, only for Yhwach to reveal that he does not haveThe Almightyactivated as he wants to savor his reunion with his ""son"". Ichigo says that Yhwach is not his real father lambasts the Quincy for killing his mother.[445] Ichigo enters a new, partially Hollowfied form. As Ichigo attempts to attack Yhwach, Orihime shields her friend from the Quincy's attacks. Yhwach states that Masaki's death was necessary in order for him to gain power.[446]Ichigo races at Yhwach again despite Orihime's protests, and Yhwach blocks him with dark energy, chiding him for his recklessness and saying that his death is inevitable. As Ichigo makes yet another charge, Yhwach surrounds him in dark energy and states that Ichigo's powers are not rightfully his and it is time they return to their progenitor.[447]With Ichigo continuing to rush into his torrent of dark energy, Yhwach wonders why Ichigo is not revealing his true power and notes that he will destroy both Soul Society and the Human World if not stopped. However, upon seeing the tip of his blade turning white, Ichigo has Orihime shield him and reveals to her that he needed to awaken something with Yhwach's Quincy Reiatsu, hence his repeated and seemingly reckless headlong charges. An explosion of energy engulfs Ichigo, and he enters a new form with Hollow characteristics.[448] Ichigo clashes with Yhwach after forcing him to fight at close range. Ichigo confirms Yhwach's assessment that this is the form he takes on when melding with his Hollow powers before explaining how he reforged his Zanpakutō after his Hollow and Quincy powers came into balance with one another. Noting that they should logically come forth if that balance is disrupted, Ichigo states that his Hollow powers have always come forth when he exerted his Shinigami powers before revealing that he had to draw them out with the help of Yhwach's power. As Yhwach grins at this, Ichigo moves in front ofSanten Kesshunwhile telling Orihime to keep up her guard before engaging in close range combat with Yhwach. Ichigo is pushed back by the Quincy and then forms aGetsuga Tenshōand fuses it with aGran Rey Cerobefore firing it at Yhwach.[449] Ichigo is stabbed by multiple shadow blades emerging from the wall behind him. Noting that a combined attack like this is fitting for a racial hybrid like Ichigo, Yhwach repels the attack and clashes with the young Shinigami. He activatesThe Almighty, noting that Ichigo's opportunity is now over. When Ichigo is impaled by a number of traps, Yhwach states that Ichigo should know thatThe Almightyallows him to see the future, but Ichigo reasons that there must be some limit to his precognitive ability. As Ichigo lands on top of a pillar, he is stabbed by long shadowy blades from the wall behind him, causing him to grunt in pain as he falls to the ground below while wondering what is happening. Yhwach reveals that Ichigo made a miscalculation by believing that the future is linear and explains that it diverges in countless directions from a given point in time like grains of sand in the wind. As Yhwach tells him to keep fighting and not give in to despair, Ichigo decries the idea of falling into despair after he has broken through it so many times in order to reach this moment before activating his Bankai.[450] Yhwach attacks a wounded Ichigo. However, Yhwach immediately breaks off part ofTensa Zangetsu's blade and his horn, seemingly without moving. Yhwach continues to injure Ichigo despite Orihime shielding him, before eventually revealing thatThe Almightylets him transform the future as well as foresee it.[451]Ichigo listens as Yhwach states thatThe Almightyis no different from his and Orihime's powers because he can also influence only what he can see, which is the entirety of fate. Yhwach claims that Ichigo has only been able to overcome his despair and change his fate up until now because he was not present and declares that he will cut down any future Ichigo tries to create for himself. He tells Ichigo that he can begin despairing now, prompting Ichigo to begin screaming in anger.[452] Yhwach absorbs Ichigo's power. Soon afterward, Ichigo coughs up blood after being attacked by Yhwach, who grabs him by the head while noting that he expected more of a fight from Ichigo. Noting that neither his sword nor Orihime's powers have any effect, Ichigo loses all hope of winning, prompting Yhwach to drop him while claiming that all Ichigo accomplished was providing him with some entertainment before preparing to take back the power Ichigo had inherited from him.[453]Black veins encompass Ichigo and the surrounding area as he realizes his Quincy powers along with the Hollow powers mixed with it are fading away. As his merged Hollow form dissipates, Ichigo falls to the ground.[454] Ichigo is stabbed byBook of the End. As Yhwach leaves through a portal, Rukia and Renji show up, with Renji trying and failing to attack Yhwach from behind despite Ichigo's silent protests. Soon afterward, despite Orihime's inability to restoreTensa Zangetsu, Renji hoists Ichigo up and declares that they will be confronting Yhwach, prompting Rukia to point out that simply charging in will accomplish nothing. However, they are all interrupted when Ichigo is stabbed through the shoulder byShūkurō Tsukishima, who reveals that he has altered the past so thatTensa Zangetsucan be fixed at Kūgo's behest. When Tsukishima asks him if they are even now, Ichigo confidently stands up with his restored Bankai and confirms this.[455] Ichigo unleashing a powerfulGetsuga Tenshōagainst Yhwach. Shortly after his Bankai is fixed, Ichigo and Renji begin running through the portal with Reishi footholds. Ichigo then questions if Renji tagging along was a good idea. After getting a sobering lesson from Renji, the two eventually reach Soul Society, and immediately attack Yhwach. However, Yhwach usesThe Almightyto avoid the attack and breaksTensa Zangetsuonce more.[456]After being pushed back by an energy attack from Yhwach, Ichigo glares at him as Yhwach questions why he did not have Orihime heal him before he came here. Ichigo proceeds to watch as Aizen takes on Yhwach while disguising himself as both Renji and Ichigo. When Aizen successfully tricks Yhwach into believing he has killed him, Ichigo impales Yhwach from behind before unleashing a powerfulGetsuga Tenshō.[457] Ichigo cuts Yhwach in half. As Ichigo cuts him in half, Yhwach dissolves into a mass of darkness, prompting Aizen to commend Ichigo for responding to his usage ofKyōka Suigetsuas quickly as he did. When Ichigo notes that he experienced a strange feeling similar to when Aizen usedKyōka Suigetsuon his allies, prompting Aizen to explain how he released it before Ichigo arrived and confirmed that it would work on Yhwach before revealing that Ichigo was the final component in his plan because he was unaffected by it. Suddenly, Yhwach's darkness engulfs Aizen as Yhwach himself notes that the power ofKyōka Suigetsuappears to have run out before reforming as he asks Ichigo if he really thought an attack of that caliber would be enough to kill him. Proclaiming that he can even rewrite futures where he dies usingThe Almighty, Yhwach bashesTensa Zangetsuout of Ichigo's hand and engulfs him and the rest of the Seireitei in his darkness before declaring that everything will lose its form and become one before his power. However, Yhwach is interrupted when Uryū fires the silver arrowhead through his chest, to the surprise of both him and Ichigo. Yhwach's darkness suddenly clears from his body as he briefly loses his powers, prompting Uryū to tell Ichigo to move now. With his cracked Bankai in hand, Ichigo leaps toward Yhwach, who is beginning to regain his powers and seemingly shatters the blade in his hand. However, the blade instead crumbles to reveal the originalZangetsuin Ichigo's hands, prompting a stunned Yhwach to realize that this is what Haschwalth was trying to warn him about with his dream as Ichigo cuts him in two.[458]Yhwach grabs hold ofZangetsuand laments to Ichigo how the path is being closed to a world without fear and how thanks to Ichigo existence will continue as it always has in a cycle of life and death.[459] Less than ten years later, Ichigo marries Orihime and they have a son namedKazui Kurosaki. Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Ichigo has a get-together with his Karakura friends at the Kurosaki Clinic to see Sado's upcoming boxing match on TV. Rukia and Renji come to the Kurosaki Clinic and Ichigo greets them at the door, inviting them inside. As Sado's match begins, Ichigo calls Orihime to the living room and asks her where Kazui is. She replies that he is probably upstairs, and Ichigo wonders if Yuzu is fine with him being in her room, which she affirms. Ichigo then asks Rukia and Renji abouttheir childcoming, and after realising she has disappeared, Rukia flippantly guesses that she is getting into fights. Ichigo is shocked by Rukia's attitude and the two begin arguing.[460]"

Three hours before Ukitake'sKonsō Reisai, Ichigo is contacted by Renji on a video call and informed of the ceremony, which he considers unethical, as well as him being invited to attend it by Shunsui and Rukia, who joins Renji and marvels at the new technology. When Ichigo reveals that Orihime is at home doing laundry instead of at Keigo's ramen shop with him, he is astonished when Rukia assumes that this means their marriage is crumbling, something that he angrily denies, and learns of the latter's exposure to television following Urahara's recent work with the Shinigami Research and Development Institute.[461] Ichigo joins the other lieutenants and meets the new ones. That night, Ichigo gathers with Renji and the other lieutenants in the Human World for theJogimen Reibakuceremony, where he questions the need for them all to be there and is introduced to7th DivisionLieutenantAtau Rindōas well as8th DivisionLieutenantYuyu Yayahara, who immediately accosts him for a selfie to post on social media since she knows Ichigo is the hero of the Quincy Blood War despite Ichigo's confusion and protests.

He has repeatedly caught an opponent's weapon strikes with a single hand.[474]He effortlessly defeats multiple bullies and gangsters on a regular basis, and is a better martial artist thanTatsuki Arisawa, the second nationally ranked competitor of their age group.

Shortly after gaining Shinigami powers and with no training, he began learning advanced spiritual energy sensing techniques by sheer instinct. While it takes most Shinigami at least 10 years to achieve Bankai, he did so in two days .[484][485]At the same time, he also gained considerable skill and experience in Shunpo while training with Yoruichi.[486]In addition, Ichigo continued to improve his Holllow powers. He increased the time he could maintain his mask from only eleven seconds to several minutes. WhereasUlquiorra Ciferinstantly incapacitated Ichigo with a Cero, even with his Hollow mask , only a few hours later, Ichigo withstands another Cero from Ulquiorra without his mask and could analyze the 4th Espada's movements.[487][488]When he was deprived of his Shinigami powers, he developed and completed his Fullbring at an astonishing pace as well, even catchingShūkurō Tsukishimaoff guard.[489]From the onset of theQuincy Blood War, his latent abilities made theWandenreichrecognize him as one of the5 Special War Powers,[490]and the most dangerous one afterKenpachi Zaraki's defeat.[491][492]To which, only a week of training with the Royal Guard tremendously increased his power as he went from needing his Bankai to combat a single Sternritter'sVollständig[493]to only using his Shikai to calmly over power four Sternritter[494]also using their respectiveVollständig.[495]Likewise, while effortlessly overpowered by Yhwach during their first fight, even with his Bankai, during the second fight, Ichigo decisively outmaneuvered and overpowered the Quincy King with just his Shikai .[496]Also in this short time, he gained a new Hollow form that he could fully control, and with it, he ingeniously uses a unique blend of techniques powerful enough to wound even aSoul King-empoweredYhwach.[497] Keen Intellect: Despite his somewhat punkish attitude, Ichigo is analytical, perceptive, and deductive.

After becoming a Shinigami, his senses have continued to improve with time, learning various advanced sensing techniques, such as using a spirit ribbon to find Yūichi Shibata .[510]Even from a considerable distance, he can detect the condition of a being with spiritual power. During his intense fight against Kenpachi Zaraki, he clearly sensed and recognized Sado's energy signature even as it weakened, despite the considerable distance between them.[511]"

His overall skill allows him to fight evenly against sword masters of Byakuya Kuchiki and Kenpachi Zaraki's caliber. While usually fighting right-handed, Ichigo is ambidextrous, proficiently wielding Zangetsu in either hand.[512][513][514]Since attaining the true form of Zangetsu, he has displayed great skill at wielding both blades at once without any trouble.[515][516][517] Shunpo Master: Though not particularly versed in its various techniques, Ichigo is proficient enough in the general usage ofShunpoto keep up with and even surprise high-level and fast opponents with his speed. Byakuya Kuchiki, one of the most proficientShunpousers in Soul Society, complimented Ichigo's growing mastery of the technique.[524]Since his training in the Soul King Palace, Ichigo has refined his skill inShunpo, allowing him to speed down the massive gap between the Palace and theSeireiteithat would normally take a week to descend[525]in just half a day[526]and move several miles in a single leap while simultaneously bypassing the perception of multiple Sternritter.[527]When battlingYhwach, whom he originally only just managed to keep up with using the hyperspeed of his originalBankai, for the second time, Ichigo repeatedly outmaneuvered Yhwach with just his natural speed, to which the Quincy King commended him for.[528] Immense Strength: While in his Shinigami body, Ichigo's already impressive strength is greatly magnified, able to knock outMarechiyo Ōmaedaand destroy his Shikai at the same time with a single punch.[475]He can easily stop repeated axe blows fromJidanbōbefore shattering Jidanbō's axes in a single swing, and hurl Rukia a dozen meters into Renji's arms and send them both skidding several meters more, achieving both feats with a single arm.[529][530]With a simple kick, he can break down and launch a large chunk of a stone wall.[531]After regaining his Shinigami powers, one swing from his Zanpakutō produced a shockwave powerful enough to overwhelmKūgo Ginjō, making the Fullbringer mistake it for aGetsuga Tenshō.[532]When fighting Quilge Opie, Ichigo grabbed one of his Heilig Pfeil with his bare hand and threw it back.[533]After returning from the Soul King Palace, Ichigo has increased in strength, allowing him to throw four Sternritter into separate buildings in rapid succession without any visible effort.[534] Immense Endurance: When in Shinigami form, Ichigo is incredibly resilient; he can continue fighting effectively after receiving many injuries, and can survive attacks which would easily kill normal humans and even most Shinigami.[535]Uryū once stated Ichigo was a monster in this regard,[536]and Aizen commented on his ability to continue moving despite being nearly cut in half.[537] Immense Durability: Ichigo's durability is also greatly increased in his Shinigami form. During his last fight with Kūgo Ginjō, he withstood a direct hit from the Getsuga Tenshō created by his opponent, only mildly harmed.[538]When fighting Quilge Opie, Ichigo withstood the impact of several Heilig Pfeil fired at him, unharmed, despite the powerful explosion each one caused.[539]Tenjirō Kirinji, a member of the Royal Guard, was amazed at Ichigo's ability to endure the unique healing properties of hisWhite Skeleton PondandBlood Hell Pondfor so long after fully healing without rotting.[540]After his training in the Soul King Palace, his durability has increased to the point where he can withstand a direct attack fromMeninas McAllonwith only scratches on his face, something whichRobert Accutronecommended him for.[541]"
What is the name of Ichigo's second Fullbring appearance?,Reiatsu,Former powers & abilities,"Zangetsu's constantShikaiform. Zangetsu'sShikaiVersion 2. Zangetsu'sBankai: Tensa Zangetsu. Tensa Zangetsu Version 2. Tensa Zangetsu Version 3. EnhancedGetsuga Tenshō. An enraged Ichigo exerts his turbulent Reiatsu while using his Bankai. Ichigo assuming the form of theFinal Getsuga Tenshō. Ichigo's badge being used as his Fullbring focus. Initially, Ichigo's Fullbring powers focused on changing the form of his Substitute Shinigami Badge.[638]By recalling the memories of his pride as a Shinigami, Ichigo causes the badge to release black Reiatsu in the shape of the tsuba ofTensa Zangetsu.[639]Like a tsuba, the weapon is used primarily for defense, particularly to block attacks. It can absorb most of the impact from a much larger opponent's attack.[640]Like a real tsuba, it has no cutting power, and if Ichigo releases his hold on the badge, the Reiatsu dissipates.[641] Ichigo's second Fullbring appearance. Later, his Fullbring powers evolve so they change his appearance, covering his whole body in a black Reiatsu, and produce a dark blade, forming over his arm.[642]His abilities are classified as a Clad-Type Fullbring because Ichigo is shrouded in his own power, which resembles a Shihakushō, much like his former Bankai.[643] Ichigo's completed Fullbring appearance. After Ichigo's Fullbring is completed, it transforms into a solid outfit. It becomes a white armor covering his chest, arms, shoulders, and feet, with a stripe running across his face. Underneath this, he wears a completely black bodysuit. The badge grows a medium-sized, black, machete-like blade, with a silver edge, round hilt, simple white cloth-wrapping, and flat base. The badge itself becomes the guard, with a new black cross marking on it. It is hung across Ichigo's back in a white sheath.[644][645] Ichigo's Fullbring version ofGetsuga Tenshō. Ichigo's original mask. Hollow Mask: Ichigo's Hollow mask has the appearance of what could best be described as a menacing skull. The mask is white, and originally had only three red stripes on the left side,[656]which have since increased in number.[657]The stripes change in thickness after he subjugates his inner Hollow.[658]It eventually covers almost the entirety of the mask's left half during his third battle withGrimmjow Jaegerjaquez.[659]While pure white on the right side, the mask possesses a total of ten red stripes spread across three spots on the left side of his mask.[660][661] Ichigo's new mask. Because Ichigo's inner Hollow took a new form while facingUlquiorra Cifer,[662]Ichigo's mask has changed again. Where his mask once had a series of thick red stripes which covered almost the entire left half of his mask, there are now only two thick vertical black stripes, each on one half of the mask, which are interrupted by the widened eye-holes and the jaw.[663][664] Ichigo donning his mask. The Hollow mask was originally a sign of Ichigo's possession by his inner Hollow, but after his training with the Visored, it merely indicates he is utilizing his Hollow powers. To access his inner Hollow's power, Ichigo must summon the mask onto his face. He normally does this by placing one of his hands over his face, and concentrating spiritual matter on it in order to manifest the mask , summoning the mask in a ""ripping"" fashion. With the mask in place, Ichigo's eyes irises become yellow, and he has black sclera and pupils. His voice has a slight Hollow echo to it. With the mask, he gains access to increased physical enhancements. Strangely, though most of the other Visored have been able to shift the position of the mask while apparently still retaining the abilities of their Hollowfied state, as well as using general Hollow abilities, Ichigo has never done either."

What was the name of Rukia's sister?,Hisana,History,"Hisana abandons Rukia. Approximately 150 years ago,[20]Rukia and her older sister,Hisana, were brought together to Inuzuri, the 78th District ofRukongai, after they died in theHuman World. Unable to live there while caring for a child, Hisana abandoned Rukia when she was still a baby.[21]Rukia grew up on her own for a considerable amount of time. One day, Rukia tripped an adult who was chasingRenji Abarai's group of friends, and urged them to follow her to avoid losing the water they had stolen. Rukia joined their group, becoming their spiritual leader, and they lived together as a family.[22]The group included Fujimaru the tallest who had a strong sense of responsibility and was the witty one, Kosaburou who was quiet and a hard worker, and Mameji who was the butt of all the jokes and timid but good with numbers.[23] A young Rukia savesRenjiand his friends. They all hated Inuzuri and the people there. Rukia exhibited some spiritual power during this time. Ten years after Rukia joined the group, with all of their friends dead, Rukia proposed they becomeShinigamiand live inSeireitei, noting she had heard it was pretty there. Renji agreed with her. As they were gifted with spiritual powers, they entered theShin'ō Academywith ease, where they struggled to stand out from those from thenoble families.[24]The night before the welcoming ceremony for the new students of the Academy, against Rukia's advice, Renji slept in a tree. The following morning, he fell out of the tree and landed on a headstone where a startledIzuru Kirahad been praying, for which Rukia scolded him.[25] Rukia and Renji part ways. Two months after entering the Academy, Renji, scolding Rukia for still not fitting in, informed her he was going to theHuman Worldfor field training to practiceKonsōfor the first time. Rukia complained about this being unfair, but Renji retorted that it is about talent, and that he will get stronger. Rukia said she will show him she is the stronger one, but trailed off.[26]One day,Byakuya Kuchikiinformed Rukia that theKuchiki Clanwas interested in adopting her and having her graduate immediately to be assigned to the13th Division. In the middle of this meeting, Renji burst into the room to tell her he had passed an important exam. Disappointed with the interruption, the nobles left, and Rukia told Renji of their offer, which he congratulated her on. Rukia thanked him and left.[27]Rukia was told Byakuya adopted her into the Kuchiki Clan due to her similarity to Hisana, whom he had married.[2] Kaienteaching Rukia how to treat her superiors. Rukia was admitted to the 13th Division without taking their entrance exam. On her first day in the Division, she is shown into a room by a fellow Shinigami, whom she told to treat her like any other new recruit. After he left, she heard him and others talking about her and the favoritism shown to nobles. Rukia was disappointed it was like that there as well. LieutenantKaien Shibaentered the room, introduced himself, and scolded her for her weak reply. Rukia was deeply happy she could have a normal relationship with her superior, rather than being treated as special. That evening, Rukia reported to Byakuya her first day had ended peacefully and she did not attain a Seated Officer position, but Byakuya asked her to leave.[28]Unbeknownst to Rukia, this was exactly what Byakuya wanted to hear as he made arrangements to ensure Rukia would not be a seated officer out of concern for her safety from his promise to Hisana.[29]Later, Rukia, becomingKiyone Kotetsu's assistant, went on a mission to the Human World.[30] Rukia achievesShikaiunder Kaien's tutelage. During her time in the 13th Division, she became friends with Kaien. One day, seeing she was gloomy, Kaien told her as long as she was in his Division, he would stand by her, even if he died. They were interrupted by the drunk Kiyone andSentarō Kotsubaki, who tried to encourage her.[31]Kaien mentored Rukia, teaching her how to fight.[32]Their first training location was Mount Koifushi of Hokutan, the 3rd District of West Rukongai, where Kaien taught her about the concept of the heart.[33]He was present when she learned her Shikai's first two ""dances"".[34] Miyako leaves on her last mission. Rukia greatly admired Kaien's wife, 3rd SeatMiyako Shiba, wanting to be like her someday.[35]When Miyako was killed bya Hollow, Rukia, Kaien, and Ukitake went to its lair.[36]She offered to go first in order to scout out its abilities, but Kaien asked to face the Hollow alone. When its special ability destroyed Kaien's Zanpakutō, Rukia attempted to help, but was stopped by Ukitake. He told her Kaien's fight was one of honor rather than a fight for his life. If she were to help, Kaien's life would be saved, but his honor would be forever damaged. After protesting about this, Rukia reluctantly obeyed his order. However, the Hollow, entering Kaien's body, possessed him.[37] Kaien thanking Rukia for killing him. The Hollow attempted to attack Rukia, but Ukitake, blocking it, sent Rukia away as he fought it. Afraid to fight it, she obeyed, but she came back because she wished to help Kaien and was afraid to face her cowardice in future. As it leaped at her, she noted it was no longer Kaien. Unable to bear seeing him like that, she stabbed Kaien. He thanked Rukia and apologized for dragging her into it. Kaien died in Rukia's arms.[38]Rukia brought the corpse to the Shiba family estate, but was afraid to apologize out of guilt from her role in Kaien's death.[39][40] Forty years after her adoption into the Kuchiki Clan, Kiyone and Sentarō informed Rukia she had been assigned to the Human World. Rukia thought this was a transfer order, which Kiyone denied, reminding her of her previous mission to the Human World, which Rukia still failed to remember. Ukitake told her she was being assigned toKarakura Townfor one month, which should be easy for her. Rukia thanked him for telling her. Ukitake asked if she had told Byakuya about it, but she stated he would not wish to be bothered with such a minor thing. Ukitake offered to tell him for her, for which Rukia thanked him.[30]"

On the 16th of June, Rukia notices Ichigo is very distracted. After a family meeting that night, Ichigo tells the confused Rukia the following day is the anniversary ofhis mother's death.[66] Rukia asks aboutMasaki's death. The following day, Rukia waits for Ichigo near Masaki's grave. She questions Ichigo about his mother's death, asking if a Hollow killed her.

Rukia declines, politely saying she is too shy. The following Wednesday evening, Rukia accompanies several of her classmates to the broadcast at an abandoned hospital. Telling Ichigo he must be tired from his dual life, she instructs him to relax. She reveals she does not know what the ""festival"" is about. Ichigo explains it to her, but she still does not understand. He asks Rukia if there really is a spirit there, thinking the Shinigami would have dealt with it. She states it is likely aJibakurei, which can be difficult for Shinigami to detect.[76] When the Jibakurei screams, Rukia tells him it is aDemi-Hollow. As the show begins filming, Rukia, turning her attention to the events unfolding, is impressed with Kanonji's entrance. Ichigo asks her if they should perform Konsō on the Jibakurei, but Rukia tells him it takes months to years for one to turn into a Hollow.

However, Don Kanonji jams his staff into the hole on the Demi-Hollow's chest.[77]Rukia condemns Kanonji's actions. When Ichigo is pounced on by security after attempting to stop Kanonji, Rukia, trying to change him into a Shinigami, is caught as well.

After Urahara knocks the guards unconscious with a blast, Rukia berates him for using Soul Society's tools so freely.[78]When the spirit disappears, Rukia, realizing its body is about to reform into a Hollow, searches for it with her Denreishinki. She yells at Ichigo to look above him,[79]attracting the attention of some security guards.[80] Rukia and company are called before the principal. The following day, Rukia and the others are called before the school principal over their appearance on the show. Rukia distractsKagineby claiming responsibility, allowing the others to flee. When Kagine notices the others are gone, Rukia escapes as well. That afternoon, she receives an order and leaves with Ichigo. As they bicker, they passUryū Ishida.[81]Later that week, Rukia and Ichigo arrive at what they believe to be the site of a Hollow attack, but find aPluscowering in a corner and no Hollow. Ichigo suggests her Denreishinki is broken, but Rukia insists it is working, rebuking Ichigo's suggestion that there is another Shinigami defeating the Hollows before him. Rukia is unable to get the Plus to reveal who saved him, but determines somebody is responsible.[82] Rukia decides to call Urahara to ask whether her Denreishinki is broken. When he does not answer, she complains about him to herself. After school, she and Ichigo arrive at yet another site with no Hollow. The pair is approached by Uryū, who tells them a new Hollow has appeared. An order confirms this, and she is surprised when Uryū kills it.

Later, she visits Urahara, and after scolding him for not answering her calls, asks about the Quincy.[84]Rukia is confused by the repeated appearance and disappearance of Hollows. Seeing a large number of Hollows, Rukia goes outside and notices a spiritual disturbance in the sky.[85] Later, Rukia is attacked by a Hollow. During the fight, she realizes, with annoyance, her power has not recovered, despite her being in a Gigai for two months. Kon, arriving, subdues the Hollow, but Rukia bickers with him for forgetting what he was supposed to tell her. When Uryū interrupts them, Rukia deduces he is responsible for the large amount of Hollows. Ichigo, arriving, argues with Kon.[86]The group argues until they notice the Hollows are gathering at the disturbance in the sky. When Uryū leaves, Rukia tells Ichigo about the Quincy and their extermination by the Shinigami.[87][88]Ichigo chases after Uryū, leaving her alone with Kon.

She then leaves the Kurosaki clinic[93][94][95] Renji attacks Rukia to apprehend her. Lost in thought as she runs, Rukia is surprised by Renji. Complaining she has become too soft in the two months she has been missing. He demands she summon the Human she gave her powers to. When Rukia denies doing such a thing, Renji asks why she is acting like that. Byakuya appears behind Rukia, surprising her. When Renji prepares to attack her seriously, Uryū intervenes, but is unable to defeat him.[96]As Rukia notes Renji's increased strength, Ichigo arrives.[97]Angry that he came after her, Rukia watchesIchigo and Renji fight.[98] Rukia kicking Ichigo's arm away from Byakuya. Hoping Ichigo will run away, Rukia leaps on Renji to distract him.

When Äs explains how fear works and proclaims she has no way of becoming unable to feel fear, Rukia reveals fear cannot affect her because she is not technically alive before explaining how the true power ofSode no Shirayukiallows her to drop her temperature to below freezing. Though Äs does not believe such a thing is possible, Rukia attacks him multiple times at varying degrees until he is left frozen solid.[214] Rukia is surrounded by Äs'Tatarforasability. Slowly raising her body temperature to a normal level, Rukia notices a small cut on her finger and wonders if she stayed at absolute zero for more than 4 seconds. Noticing Äs still moving, Rukia watches as he activates hisQuincy: Vollständig. When Rukia tries to freeze him, Äs moves behind her as Rukia notices she cannot move. Revealing his fear ability now works on sight instead of on contact with his thorns, Äs generates innumerable eyes around Rukia and explains how she can no longer escape his gaze and must feel fear. As Rukia experiences intense fear, Byakuya cuts through the eyes, saving her.[215] Rukia activatesHakka no Togame. Rukia warns Byakuya to avoid eye contact with Äs as he unleashes his power again. However, the attack is easily deflected by Byakuya. While observing Äs running wild with rage, Byakuya compliments Rukia on becoming stronger, an acknowledgement which leads Rukia to shed a tear. He further encourages her by stating that she has nothing to fear, and with that, leaves the fight to her. Rukia unleashes her Bankai, and a blinding pillar of white emerges.[216]As Äs is frozen solid and fades away, Rukia stands in her Bankai form as a crack appears on the back of her hand. Stepping forward, Byakuya tells her to slow down while returning to normal temperature. While complimenting her Bankai, Byakuya proceeds to tell Rukia it requires delicate control to prevent herself from getting harmed as well and reminds her that a blade wielded with the cost of the wielder's life will not be able to protect anything. She obeys Byakuya and moves on with him.[217] Rukia confronts the Sternritter alongside several other Shinigami. Later on, Rukia and Byakuya head towards the location of the defeated Zaraki, seeing lightning in the distance. Byakuya tells Rukia to take it easy due to her injuries. She starts to answer, but suddenly stops as she notices Ichigo's Reiatsu coming closer.[218]Soon afterward, Rukia, Renji, Byakuya, Hisagi, Ikkaku, and Yumichika confront the Sternritter gathered at Ichigo's location.[219]WhenBazz-Btries to break through using his Spirit Weapon, Rukia freezes his arm and repeats that they will not let the Sternritter pass. Rukia prepares to defend herself as all the Quincy activate theirQuincy: Vollständigand charge.[220] However, the combatants are scattered by the enormous explosion that occurs when Yhwach, Haschwalth, and Uryū depart for the Soul King Palace. Afterwards, Renji pushes rubble off of himself and Rukia withHihiōbefore noting that they were separated. When Rukia wonders why Uryū betrayed them, Bazz-B appears and offers to help them kill Uryū, but Renji throws some rubble at him and declines before insulting his mohawk. Angered by this, Bazz-B usesBurner Finger 4, engulfing the area in a massive explosion.[221]Later, when Bazz-B's powers are taken by Yhwach'sAuswählen, Rukia looks on in surprise at the turn of events.[222] Rukia and Renji charge spheres with their Reiatsu Soon afterward, Rukia and Renji arrive at the laboratory Urahara is using after receiving an urgent summons, where they find Marechiyo andShinji Hirakooutside. After Shinji and Marechiyo inform them of how they survived Bazz-B's attack, they are surprised by the arrival of Suì-Fēng, whom Rukia notes is showing her kinder side.[223]Inside the building, Rukia is shocked to learn of Urahara's intention to break into the Soul King Palace.[224]After Zaraki agrees to leave the search for his lieutenant to the rest of his division, Urahara gives Rukia a sphere to charge with her Reiatsu.[225]WhenHiyori Sarugakiarrives and pours a strange liquid on the floor, Rukia notes that she does not feel wet.[226] When Seireitei starts falling apart, Urahara states theSoul Kingmust have died, shocking Rukia and the other Shinigami.[227]A distraught Rukia watches as Ukitake uses the power ofMimihagito replace the Soul King.[228]Whenblack creaturesbegin pouring into the Seireitei, Rukia emerges from the lab alongside Renji and Byakuya to confront them before expressing shock when Aizen arrives.[229]She demands to know how he got out before becoming even more shocked whenShunsui Kyōrakuappears and admits to letting him out. Rukia and the others loudly protest, but they are silenced by Shunsui stating they must set their pride aside and fight evil with evil.[230]After Aizen destroys the black creatures and begins exerting his Reiatsu to destroy the veil of darkness above them, Rukia shouts for him to stop when the pressure starts breaking apart the doorway to the Royal Realm, prompting Aizen to say he will drag down the palace to them instead.[231] Rukia moves out towardWahrweltalongside the other Shinigami. As Aizen's Reiatsu starts cracking open the veil, Rukia tries to move towards him, but is stopped by Shunsui grabbing her shoulder and watches as Aizen's attempt is interrupted by his restraints restraining his Reiatsu.[232]After Bazz-B,Liltotto Lamperd, andGiselle Gewelleshow up to help the Gotei 13, Rukia returns to fueling the doorway with her Reiatsu alongside them.[233]WhenYhwachbegins tearing apart the Wandenreich city in the Seireitei, Rukia watches in concern. Shortly afterward, the doorway is completed,[234]and Rukia enters the Soul King Palace alongside the other Shinigami, where she agrees with Shunsui's command of moving forward and protecting the Seireitei no matter what.[235]After Yhwach creates his new stronghold,Wahrwelt, Rukia moves out toward it alongside her allies.[236] Rukia runs through the city along with the other Shinigami asLille Barrobegins sniping them. However, she manages to avoid the shots and continues running after Shunsui locates Lille. Rukia and the remaining Shinigami reach the upper levels of the city, and Shinji warns them to stay focused. They are then confronted byGerard Valkyrie, who says the Shinigami will have to team up and beat him in order to continue.[237] Renji and Byakuya easily defeat Gerard, but before the Shinigami depart a giant foot rises up and slams into the ground. A giant Gerard then rises up and shouts at the Shinigami, pushing them back with the force of his voice. Gerard explains how his SchriftThe Miracleworks as he throws an obelisk at the Shinigami, splitting them up. Gerard slams Shinji andMomo Hinamoriinto the ground and does the same to Byakuya after deflecting one of his attacks, causing Rukia and Renji to cry out in shock. Gerard then blows onto Rukia and Renji, the force of his breath slamming them into the ground. Gerard then stands victorious over the Shinigami.[238] Rukia and Renji survive Gerard's attack, and much later Rukia is carried by Renji back up to where Gerard is. However, they are overwhelmed by Gerard's monstrous presence, as the Quincy has grown even larger since when they last saw him. They are greeted by a matured Hitsugaya, and Renji wonders who he is. Rukia states that it is obviously Hitsugaya's older brother, and Hitsugaya goes along with what she said. Suddenly, Rukia and Renji sense that Ichigo is confronting Yhwach up in the palace.[239] Byakuya rescues Rukia and Renji from Gerard's attack. Rukia and Renji run through the rubble when Gerard suddenly swipes at them; however, they are rescued by Byakuya. Byakuya tells them to meet up with Ichigo, and Rukia argues against him, but Byakuya tells them that Ichigo's Reiatsu is comparable with Yhwach's. As Byakuya blocks another of Gerard's attacks, he tells Rukia and Renji that he is not saying Ichigo needs them, but that he has no need for them here. Rukia and Renji thank him for his honesty as they run off to the palace.[240] Rukia and Renji arrive at the palace as Yhwach departs. Rukia and Renji arrive at the palace as Yhwach prepares to depart after defeating Ichigo. He expresses annoyance at their insignificant appearance and invites them to follow him through his portal, where he would give them an extravagant death in the moment when each of them feels the greatest joy and happiness.[241]After Yhwach escapes, Rukia tends to Orihime, and becomes shocked after she hears that he has the power to re-write the future.[242] Less than ten years later, Rukia marries Renji and they have a daughter namedIchika Abarai.[243] Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Rukia is inaugurated as the Captain of the 13th Division.[244]Immediately afterwards, she, Renji, and Ichika depart for Karakura Town in order to visit the Kurosaki Clinic. Rukia greets Ichigo and her human friends, and Ichigo wonders about the absent Ichika. Rukia flippantly guesses that she is getting into fights, which shocks Ichigo, causing the two to have a brief argument.[243]"
"How many years after her inauguration as Captain of the 13th Division did Rukia, alongside Captain-commander Kyraku, personally extend an invitation for Ichigo to attend the Kons Reisaiceremony for the late Ukitake?",Two,Echoing jaws of hell arc,"Two years after her inauguration as Captain of the 13th Division, Rukia, alongside Captain-commander Kyōraku, personally extends an invitation for Ichigo to attend theKonsō Reisaiceremony for the late Ukitake. As Renji and Ichigo communicate over a video call concerning this news, Rukia interrupts them and is pleasantly surprised to see Ichigo on Renji'sDenreishinki, which she realizes must be a new model.[245] Rukia joins Ichigo and Renji's video call. Rukia explains that she still has her oldDenreishinkisince it works fine and that she did not know about the video call function of the new model until now; Rukia attempts to see Orihime by tilting Renji'sDenreishinki, only for Ichigo to inform her that this will not work and that Orihime is doing laundry at home. In response, Rukia teasingly assumes that Ichigo leaves all of the housework to his wife and that means they are an estranged couple continuing to live under the same roof despite losing their domestic bliss because of emotional abuse, leaving Ichigo aghast at such an idea and wondering where Rukia learned about such terms, which prompts Rukia to proudly and smugly tell him that they now have television in Soul Society and can watch shows from the Human World.[246] Rukia and Renji are startled by Mayuri's hologram appearing behind them. After Renji elaborates to Ichigo that Urahara began working with theShinigami Research and Development Instituteafter theQuincy Blood Warto developed all sorts of new Reishi devices, leading an impressed Ichigo to comment on his skill. Suddenly, CaptainMayuri Kurotsuchiappears behind Rukia and Renji to proclaim that he cannot let such a remark go unheard, startling them both. Though Renji presumes Mayuri is actually here, Rukia reveals that this is actually a hologram being projected by a grotesque bug flying overhead, to Renji's disgust, and Mayuri clarifies that squashing the bug is futile since others he has deployed will take its place.[247] Rukia and the other captains noticeJigoku no Rinkiaround Ukitake's grave. Rukia later accompanies the other captains to Ukitake's grave to perform theKonsō Reisai, where she and the others seeJigoku no Rinkifloating around the gravesite and learn from Shunsui that the ritual serves to send the deceased captains' souls to Hell. A distraught Rukia confronts Shunsui over this revelation, and the Captain-Commander clarifies that even though he only discovered it recently, he can sadly confirm it is the truth, to her further distress.[248]"

What does Ury like to wear? (A) A mantle. (B) A mantle. (C) A mantle.,(A),Personality,"Uryū is generally quiet and solitary, but tries harder to act cool when other people are around. Uryū is a member of the handicrafts club at Karakura High School, and is highly skilled at sewing. While Uryū does not mind stitching things for his friends, his sense of design forces him to add unexpected designs. For example, when he makes new clothing for Chad and Orihime, he replaces the single red line of Chad's original shirt with a red cross, saying that it wasbetter, and since he could not copy the three white dots on Orihime's shirt, he instead adds frilly lace and two flower-like buds at the bottom.[11]Uryū has low blood pressure and hates procrastination.[12]The other things he hates are quite odd: buttons [12]and the word ""haphazard."" His favorite food is homemademackerelmisostew.[12]He likesDon Kanonji's television program ""Bura-Rei"" so much that he attends the live broadcast of the filming in Karakura Town.[13] He loves wearing a mantle, even though it serves no purpose other than to make him feel cooler, despite the fact that it hinders his movement, even keeping a spare with him. He has a tendency to say things melodramatically. Uryū has proven to be gullible at times. During an omake, he starts getting irritated at the fact that a weapon has a will of own; Ichigo tricks him into thinking that Ginrei Kōjaku has actually materialized, to which Uryū sheds a happy tear.[14] Uryū operates on a moral ethic known as the ""Pride of the Quincy"" and has a strong sense of justice. He is very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly, leading him to attempt to defendRukia KuchikifromRenji Abaraiwhen he andByakuya Kuchikicame to theHuman Worldto arrest her, and protectsOrihime Inoueduring their time inSoul Society. Despite him disliking Shinigami, Uryū has learned to at least work closely with the ones whom Ichigo is closest with and has supposedly discarded most of his personal grudge. He also has a tendency to not use lethal force in battle, especially if he can win without doing so while often trying to simply incapacitate his opponent."
How old was Ury when he married Kanae Katagiri?,ten,History,"A young Uryū carried by his mother,Kanae Katagiri. Uryū was born after Ryūken Ishida marriedKanae Katagiriwhich happened after the infection ofMasaki Kurosaki, to whom Ryūken's mother originally intended him to marry. Six years before he befriendedIchigo Kurosaki, his mother lost consciousness on the same day Masaki died, June 17th, and died herself three months later asYhwachperformed hisAuswählentechnique and took her powers.[15] As a child, Uryū mostly interacted and trained with his paternal grandfather, Sōken Ishida. His father, Ryūken Ishida, was less than enthusiastic about being a Quincy, claiming that it was not a profitable occupation. They do not appear to be on very good terms as a result, given Uryū's casual use of his father's given name. Sōken understands Ryūken's reasoning, since being a Quincy is more about justice than material rewards, and Ryūken has a family to support. Sōken told Uryū that he would someday understand his father's motives, but thus far this is not the case. This was compounded as Uryū would watch Ryūken dissect Kanae's dead body, and he begged his father to stop. That day, he decided he would never become a doctor.[16] At a fairly young age, Uryū's paternal grandfather was killed byHollowsright in front of him, and Uryū was unable to do a thing to protect him.[17]This is one of the reasons why he hates the Shinigami, who did not come to rescue Sōken in time.[17]"
Who does Orihime try to recruit Ury to?,"Sado, Orihime, and Yoruichi",Soul society arc,"Sado, Orihime, and Yoruichi try to recruit Uryū. Wanting to go and save Rukia, Uryū trains to better equip himself for the next time he battles a Shinigami. He goes to a secluded spot by a waterfall to do so. However, he is found byYasutora Sado,Orihime Inoue, andYoruichi Shihōin. He learns from Orihime that both she and Sado are going to take lessons to go to Soul Society, and asks him if he want to join them. He asks who their master would be. Uryū is utterly surprised to find that their master is a talking cat. He regains his composure, apologizing for his rudeness. Yoruichi accepts his apology, insulting Uryū for making a fuss over a talking cat. Orihime reinforces how a talking cat is not a big deal, and again encourages Uryū to take Yoruichi's lessons, believing he also wants to rescue Rukia. However, Uryū declines her offer. Orihime wonders why, pointing out that she and Sado were only able to find Uryū because of Yoruichi's ability to senseReiatsu. Uryū explains that the issue is not that he does not have faith in Yoruichi's abilities, but that he has to train alone. He then lies, saying he had never thought of actually rescuing Rukia, but was only training because he could not forgive himself for losing to a Shinigami. Thinking that there is no point in dealing with someone with no desire to go to Soul Society, Yoruichi beckons both Sado and Orihime to leave, and the three of them take their leave. Uryū quietly mutters an apology to Orihime, stating that his training cannot be seen byanyone. He then opens the box he had brought, which contained theSanrei Glove.[45] Uryū is freed from the Kōryū by Sado. In a week's time, he masters theSanrei Glove.[46]He joins Ichigo and the rest of a rescue team in going to Soul Society. Hearing Sado's comment on how he thinks Uryū might not come, he retorts that he needed to train because of his defeat against the Shinigami, and will go anywhere to win. He also addresses Ichigo, telling him that he wants him to see how strong he has become. Ichigo, however, simply notes that he is astounded Uryū would come all the way in such a ""weird"" outfit, which Uryū takes offense to. Urahara brings them all in to explain how to get to Soul Society.[47]After hearing Urahara's explanation, they follow Yoruichi, and rush through theSenkaimon.[48]While in theDangai, Uryū is almost dragged in by the Kōryū before being saved by Sado, and everyone is almost caught by Kōtotsu. They are able to get through to Soul Society intact around theRukongai, but with a rough landing. Uryū is disappointed at having to use his backup cape so soon. As they survey their surroundings, Ichigo foolishly rushes towardsSeireitei. He is soon stopped by activation of the entrance'sSekkisekiwalls and the arrival ofJidanbō Ikkanzaka.[49] Uryū questions who the large guardian is, which Yoruichi answers.[50]He is surprised at just how powerful Jidanbō is when he swings his axe down and creates a wall from the ground, stopping both Sado and Orihime. He then begins arguing with Ichigo about Ichigo's decision to fight Jidanbō one-on-one.[51]Uryū watches Ichigo's fight against Jidanbō, and is surprised when the latter is defeated. Jidanbō grants Ichigo and his friends permission to pass through the gate. Uryū questions this, to which Jidanbō reassures him, telling him he will let them through because Uryū's ""boss"" defeated him. Uryū quickly gets agitated by Jidanbō's comment, pointing out that Ichigo is not his leader. Although Jidanbō opens the gate, Uryū and the others cannot advance, due to the arrival ofGin Ichimaru.[52]They soon decide to try to get in another way. Yoruichi decides that they should go toKūkaku Shiba. The group encountersGanju Shiba, who picks a fight with Ichigo.[53] Uryū summons a narrow cannonball. Their fight is inconclusive, as Ganju quickly leaves. Ichigo vents his frustration, and Uryū tells him to calm down, thinking that Ichigo shares his same surprise at Ganju's gang. The next day, Uryū contends with a stubborn Ichigo, who refuses to leave because he wants to wait and finish his fight with Ganju. Upon arriving atKūkaku Shiba's home, both he and Ichigo are utterly shocked at how Kūkaku's house stands out. He and the others are further surprised to learn that Kūkaku is a woman.[54]Kūkaku reveals that she specializes in fireworks, and that the plan is to launch them into the Seireitei through a spirit cannon.[55]When Uryū questions the safety of such a plan, Kūkaku explains that with a special spiritual orb, they will create aReiatsushell around them, allowing them to break past the barrier and walls ofSekkisekithat protect the Seireitei, and sends them to the training room.[56]Their training goes relatively well, with Uryū successfully forming an ellipsoid sphere.[57]Afterward, they prepare to launch themselves.[58]They manage to break into Seireitei,[59]but the group is separated as the cannonball disperses. Uryū is sent flying away with Orihime after Sado suddenly moves him to Orihime, before the influx sends Sado flying out. Orihime stops their fall using Santen Kesshun.[60] Uryū confronts Jirōbō Ikkanzaka. Uryū and Orihime decide to sneak around to avoid detection. As they are doing so, they seeKenpachi Zaraki, and watch as they hide on top of a building. When Zaraki moves on, they come out and discuss where to go next. As Orihime is pointing out their next possible destination,Jirōbō Ikkanzakaof the7th Divisionalmost kills her; however, Uryū, noticing him, saves her.[61]After a short battle, Uryū dispatches him fairly easily.[62][63]Orihime gets the idea to steal a pair of Shinigami uniforms to blend in. When two possible candidates from the12th Divisionshow up, Uryū watches as Orihime takes them down single-handedly. Their disguises work fairly well, and they are able to avoid detection.[64]As they search for Ichigo, they encounterMakizō Aramakiof the11th Division. He interrogates them, asking them which division they belong to. Uryū and Orihime answer that they are from the 11th Division, but Aramaki, unable to recognize them, checks Orihime's uniform. He becomes suspicious, asking them why they are wearing 12th Division uniforms and why they were walking without their Zanpakutō. Aramaki, however, is knocked out by members of the 12th Division, who claim that they have to protect those in the same divisions. As Orihime talks with them, Uryū realizes how strange it is for them to rescue the pair, as Aramaki's reasoning did make sense. He rushes to get Orihime away as the 12th Division members are blown up byMayuri Kurotsuchi, who tries to capture Uryū and Orihime by using his own squad members as bombs.[65] Uryū and Nemu are cut by Mayuri's Shikai. Orihime is saddened by the deaths of the 12th Division members, and Uryū tries to comfort her. He turns his sights on Mayuri, who is now interested in studying Orihime because of her shield. Uryū suddenly moves next to Mayuri, pointing a bow at him, but is noticed by him, who tells Uryū that he is pretty fast for a Quincy. Mayuri states that they are a rare breed, and that he has not seen one alive for many years, but he notes that he has no interest in the Quincy, as he finished studying their kind some time ago. When Uryū questions who he is, Mayuri is taken aback at the idea that Uryū and his friends would invade Soul Society without researching their enemy. Mayuri gives his name, rank, and position. Uryū, realizing what they are up against, tells Orihime to run for it as he takes on Mayuri. Orihime refuses, so Uryū forces Aramaki to get her out of harm's way. Not about to lose a test subject, Mayuri extends his arm to catch Orihime, but it is shot off by one of Uryū's spiritual arrows.[66] Uryū facing Mayuri's Bankai. Mayuri uses his own lieutenant,Nemu Kurotsuchi, to disable Uryū long enough to land a hit on Uryū with hisShikai, which paralyzes Uryū's arm.[67]Uryū is angered by Mayuri's callous disregard for his own lieutenant. Mayuri reveals that he created Nemu, and mocks his sympathy as part of the meaningless ""Quincy pride"" they speak about until their last breath. He recalls the last Quincy he researched, who kept on calling out the name of his student, and shows Uryū a photograph, which depicts his own grandfather. Uryū states that he is thankful Orihime is not there to witness their fight, and swears on his ""Quincy pride"" that he will kill Mayuri.[68]Driven by anger at Mayuri, Uryū uses ""Ransōtengai"" to move his paralyzed body, and removes his Sanrei glove to invoke the ""Quincy: Letzt Stil"", greatly increasing his Quincy powers at the cost of losing them shortly thereafter.[69]Though more than powerful enough to defeat Mayuri in this form, Uryū is ultimately unsuccessful. After Mayuri uses hisBankaito poison Uryū, earning an arrow through the chest in return, he escapes by reducing himself to a liquid state.[70] Nemu assisting Uryū out of gratitude for sparing her father. Uryū realizes that he is going to die due to Mayuri's poison. However, Nemu calls out for him. She tells him that behind her Lieutenant insignia, there is a hidden antidote. Kneeling down next to her, Uryū finds it and tells her to drink first. Nemu states that she is made in the same way as Mayuri, and is thus unaffected by the poison. Uryū questions her intentions, but she explains that he is already dying, and it is in gratitude for not shooting her father and creator in the head, which would have been fatal. Uryū says that he intended to kill him, claiming that he missed, and takes the antidote. Leaving Nemu, he finds his way up the stairs to the Shishinrō.

When Yammy tries to retaliate, a landmine Uryū uses explodes, heavily injuring him.[108]However, Yammy is not yet dead, and is barely hanging on to the crumbling floor. Uryū tells him it is too bad the Espada ran into him, as he could have fought a little longer. He then says ""Mala Suerte"" as he shoots an arrow into Yammy, making him fall through every floor of Las Noches since Uryū broke all the pillars on the way up.

He comments that the Reiatsu above the dome is so vast and dense it does not feel like normal Reiatsu at all, more like an ocean above the sky.[112]They arrive just in time to see Ulquiorra send a point blank Cero Oscuras through Ichigo's chest, seemingly killing him.[113]In order to buy Orihime time to heal Ichigo, Uryū faces off against Ulquiorra, using hisLicht Regentechnique, which has no effect. Ulquiorra remarks how he thought Uryū was the calmest of Ichigo's friends. Uryū states that he is fighting him because he is calm. During his fight with the Espada he suffers great injuries, losing his left hand in the process. However, Uryū had already applied anesthesia, and stops the bleeding from his injury. Telling Orihime to focus on Ichigo, Uryū draws out a Seele Schneider and continues to fight. Ulquiorra shoots him with a variation of Cero to knock him out, and Orihime panics.

A large explosion occurs over Ichigo's head, saving Uryū and restoring Ichigo to his normal state. When Ichigo comes to, he is horrified to see his sword lodged in Uryū's abdomen. Though Uryū is badly injured, he is clearly pleased to see his friend returned to normal, even smiling through his pain.[117]Ulquiorra was mortally wounded in the fight, and fades away into dust. With the battle against Ulquiorra over, Ichigo goes off to help their friends, while Uryū stays behind with Orihime so she can heal his injuries.[118] After returning home, Uryū is with Chad, Rukia, Renji, and Orihime in Karakura Town, his left hand having been restored, but still in bandages.

"How many months after the White Invasion did Ury take the position of being the main protector of Karakura Townagainst Hollowincursions, due to Zennosuke Kurumadani's unreliability?",17,The lost substitute shinigami arc,"Sometime after theWhite Invasion,Ichigo Kurosakiasks him why he was not at a more prestigious school, as he figured that the son of a doctor would want to become a doctor himself. Uryū asks Ichigo the same question and reveals that he had no desire of becoming one.[121] Uryū and Ichigo beatObuta. Seventeen months later, Uryū takes the position of being the main protector ofKarakura TownagainstHollowincursions, due toZennosuke Kurumadani's unreliability. One day in class, he runs out of the classroom. As a cover, he tells the teacher he is on the way to the nurse's office.[122]When a gang from Miyakou searching for Ichigo blocks the gate to Karakura High School, Uryū tells them to stop what they are doing and leave. When one of them asks if he is Kurosaki, Uryū punches that person in anger, asking how he resembles Ichigo at all. He then says he will not allow them to leave anymore, believing not a single one of them will be able to.[123]After the fight ceases, Ichigo is kidnapped. Uryū, trying to figure out what just happened, runs into Orihime. They talk about Ichigo, having felt strange energy around him. Uryū tells her not to worry as it is probably nothing, but in his mind he thinks Ichigo is emitting Reiatsu, something he has not done in almost a year and a half.[124] Uryū chasesan unknown stranger. Later on that day, Uryū goes to Ichigo's house, where he notes that Orihime has arrived first and is trying to find out if Ichigo knows anything about the strange feeling surrounding him, just as he had planned to do. He decides to check if anything strange is happening in the town, but senses a presence above. He looks up and seesa man walking on the roof. Before he can ascertain who this stranger is, he disappears quickly. Uryū chases after him, noting that the stranger is fast and is using speed beyond that of a Human. Uryū also notes that he cannot sense any spirit particles around the stranger, so he cannot determine what technique the stranger is using to speed himself up. The stranger disappears instantly due to a strange light. Before he can react, the stranger closes in on Uryū, and he is wounded severely.[125]Uryū is left lying on the street, with his right arm severely injured, bleeding profusely as the paramedics approach his location.[126] Uryū lies in his hospital bed. Uryū is taken toKarakura Hospital, where he is operated on by his father. After the surgery, Orihime arrives to see him. When Ichigo arrives sometime after her, very worried, Uryū scolds him rather harshly for coming, attempting to keep him from getting involved. Ryūken enters the room shortly after, commenting that Uryū talks too much. Uryū asks him if he is allowed to have visitors, as they might have a bad effect on his wounds. Ryūken reminds him that he himself did the surgery, and that his wounds will not worsen. He further comments that Uryū, who was cut down, should not be ordering around his doctor. Upon hearing Ryūken's words, Ichigo asks Uryū what had happened to him, and if he could not handle it himself, then he should have gotten help. Uryū says nothing in response, prompting Ryūken to state that sharing information is important, and he should not let his kindness go to waste. Uryū tells Ryūken to be quiet, and asks Orihime to go home. Orihime complies and leaves the room along with Ichigo and Ryūken.[127] Orihime heals Uryū. Later, Uryū is visited in the hospital by Orihime. He apologizes for the sudden call and thanks her for coming. She asks if it is alright for him to be up, and he says it is fine for this. She offers to heal his wounds, saying he will be up in no time if she does. He replies that he knows, and that he was out of sorts when he initially refused. He wanted to get away if he was the true target, but the situation has changed, and he now wants her to heal him. Orihime asks what he means, and Uryū responds that Ichigo has come into contact with his attacker, which shocks Orihime. He says that there has been a shift in his Reiatsu, but it is definitely Ichigo, and asks Orihime if she has felt it too. Orihime confirms this, saying that Ichigo has chosen not to tell her anything so far. She states that whoever attacked Uryū and Ichigo is the same person who attacked her, shocking Uryū.[128]Uryū tries to think about the nature of this, but comes up short. Orihime says that the attacker called his abilityFullbring, and asks Uryū if it was the same for him. Uryū says he did not have time to ask, and that he thought it was a Zanpakutō until she told him.[129]After Uryū is fully recovered, he leaves the hospital.[130] Tsukishima cuts down Uryū while Kūgo cuts down Ichigo. Uryū eventually finds Ichigo andKūgo Ginjōfighting againstShūkurō Tsukishima. He activates hisGinrei Kojakuand tells Ichigo to come over to him. Uryū tells him that he is on his side, but Ichigo is hesitant to trust him. Uryū tells him that the man that attacked him was the one standing behind him, Kūgo, surprising Ichigo. Uryū fires his arrows at Kūgo, but he blocks them and cuts Ichigo down. Uryū tries to assist him, but Tsukishima attacks Uryū from behind, wounding him.[131]As Uryū lays helplessly, he remembers the attack earlier.[132] As Tsukishima and Kūgo are about to leave, the Shinigami arrive and use a Reishi-enhanced katana to restore Ichigo's Shinigami powers. They explain that they restored Ichigo's powers, not only as thanks for his past services, but also to deal with the original Substitute Shinigami turned traitor; Kūgo himself.[133]As Ichigo prepares to face off against Kūgo, Uryū reveals himself, saying that Rukia healed him. He says he needs to apologize to Ichigo, saying that when they returned from Soul Society and Ichigo received his substitute badge, he had assumed there were others before Ichigo. He thought that if the previous one was alive, they would have told him, and if he was dead, they would say why. Having not said either, he assumed that Soul Society did not know either. He says he should have told this to Ichigo sooner, but Ichigo simply kicks him. Ichigo says it doesn't matter, there was nothing they could have done, and he would have forgotten in a few days anyway. The two friends insult each other, before Uryū begins to think that the worst case would be if none of the scenarios he thought of were applicable. Ichigo tells him to clean his glasses, as he thinks the possibility of it is unlikely, but it is not something Ichigo needs to know.[134] Uryū and Ichigo discussing their course of action. As Uryū and Ichigo fight Kūgo, they begin hiding from him, with Uryū observing Kūgo and his abilities. Uryū realizes that Kūgo took Ichigo's Reiatsu in addition to his Fullbring. Ichigo asks Uryū if he has a plan. Uryū replies that he was not planning anything, and tries to explain the situation to Ichigo. Growing impatient, Ichigo confronts Kūgo, despite Uryū's objections. Ichigo begins to attack Kūgo with aGetsuga Tenshō. Uryū tries to stop him, realizing that Kūgo is baiting him into using it, but Ichigo fires his Getsuga anyway. Kūgo cuts through Ichigo's attack, and attacks him with his ownGetsuga Tenshō. Uryū appears behind Kūgo and attacks him with his arrows, but Kūgo avoids the attack. Uryū concludes that in addition to taking Ichigo's Fullbring and Reiatsu, Kūgo copied Ichigo's abilities as well.[135] Uryū watches as Ichigo unleashes his Bankai. As Kūgo questions why Ichigo is fighting him,[136]Ichigo dismisses Kūgo's words as an attempt to shake his resolve. Uryū agrees that he is mentally pressuring them, asking if Kūgo hopes that Ichigo will join him. Kūgo dismisses this, instructing Uryū to fire an arrow at him, and begins talking about Ichigo's Substitute Shinigami Badge. He states that the story about Substitute Shinigami who are acknowledged being awarded the badge is a lie; something Uryū had suspected. Kūgo states that all Substitute Shinigami are given a badge regardless, which shocks Uryū. Kūgo goes on to say that the badge's true purpose is to observe and restrict Ichigo as a Shinigami. Kūgo says that this whole scheme was designed to control Substitute Shinigami, and thatJūshirō Ukitakeis responsible for it. As Kūgo goes on to say that everyone in Soul Society is in on this, Uryū begins to worry about how Ichigo will handle this news. An enraged Ichigo tells him to shut up and activates his Bankai.[137]Uryū listens as Ichigo tells him that he worries too much, and dismisses the notion that Ukitake was deceiving him.[138]"

While Ichigo is fighting the Hollows that attackedRyūnosuke YukiandShino, Uryū arrives with Orihime and Sado, and they help him in the fight. Uryū comments that Ichigo's attack was dangerous. Two days later, they arrive at Ichigo's house, Uryū remarking that Ichigo has no etiquette. When Ichigo asks how he got in, he replies thatYuzu Kurosakilet him in, and asks him to get plates for the bread Orihime brought. He and Ichigo bicker over him ordering Ichigo around. Later, they begin to eat the bread Orihime brought, and he leaves the bread that he doesn't want for Ryūnosuke.[139]Uryū questions ifAsguiaro Ebernis an Arrancar, since it looked like he had part of a Hollow mask on his face.[140]AfterAkoninforms Ryūnosuke ofChōjirō Sasakibe's death, he remarks that the Soul Society probably gave Ryūnosuke that information to let Ichigo know what's happening.[141] Orihime, Sado, and Uryū return to Ichigo's house at his request to hear from Nel Tu and Pesche about theWandenreich's conquest of Hueco Mundo and capture of various Arrancar, includingDondochakka. Uryū states that he cannot accompany them, prompting Ichigo to say that he knew that, but called him anyway to avoid him sulking.[142] Shortly after Ichigo and the others depart, Uryū goes to search through his family's archives. As he laments not finding the information he was seeking, he is discovered by Ryūken, who admonishes him for entering the archives without permission. Uryū questions his father over how the force invading Soul Society and Hueco Mundo could be Quincies, and is angered when Ryūken says it has nothing to do with him and tells him to leave. Uryū states that he has a right to know as the Last Quincy, though Ryūken tells him that the answers he was seeking were not here, before walking away. After searching through more of the archives and thinking about his grandfather, Uryū realizes what his father meant, and goes to his office. In his father's desk, he finds a journal with the Wandenreich insignia on it, which he recognizes as belonging to Sōken. While reading through the book, he is confronted once again by Ryūken. Uryū demands to know if the journal's contents are true, and whether Ryūken knows aboutYhwach, the Wandenreich, andhis mother. Ryūken repeats that it has nothing to do with Uryū, leading him to run out of the room in frustration.[143] Uryū settles by a riverbank, and continues to read Sōken's journal. He is surprised to learn of a Quincy extermination from 1,000 years prior, questioning how it might relate to the extermination from 200 years ago. Reading on, he learns that the Quincy empire of 1,000 years ago, known as theLichtreich, attacked Soul Society, who opposed their plans to eliminate all Hollows, and were summarily routed by the Gotei 13. Uryū further learns that 200 years ago, the Shinigami enacted their plan to eliminate the remaining Quincies, and concludes that the two factions will forever remain at odds. As he thinks back on his interactions with Ichigo, however, Uryū is left with conflicting emotions.[144]Continuing to read the further entries, Uryū read his grandfather's entry describing the event of theAuswählenthat took place 9 years ago, during which Yhwach took the powers and lives of their living Quincy brethren to heal his wounds and increase his own power; much to the former's dismay. Knowing of Yhwach's imminent return to end the world that forsook their race and of Sōken's vow to protect the Living World from the king as the last living Quincies, Uryū finished reading the latter's journal and stepped outside into the rain. He is then approached by a hoodedJugram Haschwalth.[145][146] Yhwach speaks with Uryū in his own private chambers. He brings Uryū to Yhwach, who welcomes him to his palace and proposes the two of them fight together.[147]He is later welcomed by Yhwach, in front of the otherSternritter, who express shock that he is even on the same podium as Yhwach himself. Uryū is then declared Yhwach's successor, to the uproar of the Sternritter. After the announcement he is taken to Yhwach's chambers, who declares Uryū will soon awaken his powers and bestows upon him aSchrift, the same letter as that of Yhwach himself,""A"".[148]Commenting on the discord caused by Yhwach's decision to name him his successor, Uryū asks why the Wandenreich leader has done so. Replying that he was glad to hear his followers weren't so dependent that they'd follow his decisions blindly, Yhwach goes on to explain that it is because there must be a reason Uryū was still alive despite hisAuswählenkilling all of the Gemischt Quincy nine years prior. Uryū states that ever since his mother died, he always wondered why he survived but she did not. He says he found the answer in his grandfather's journal, stating that he confirmed the words of Yhwach to be true, that Shinigami and Quincies could never get along and that he learned who he really was. He then declares that he severed all ties to join the Wandenreich and end the Shinigami.[149]Yhwach states that Uryū possesses something which surpasses his own power and that he shouldn't over-analyze things and instead just follow his lead.[150] Uryū appearing in Soul Society with Yhwach and Haschwalth. Shortly after theSeireiteivanishes, Uryū emerges on one of the new buildings beside Yhwach and Haschwalth. Yhwach then asks him if he is familiar with the song, ""Kaiser Gesang"", to which Uryū confirms by reciting it. The Wandenreich leader then reveals that the song has an additional verse, in which the king acquires the world after nine days.[151] Uryū and Yhwach, as they observeCang DuandBG9being defeated, discuss the turning of events. Uryū asks if Yhwach predicted the captains recovering their Bankai, which Yhwach confirms.[152]He and Yhwach later observeBambietta Basterbine's defeat at the hands ofSajin Komamura's altered Bankai,Kokujō Tengen Myō'ō: Dangai Jōe. Afterwards, Uryū uses theShadowsto collect the defeated Cang Du and BG9.[153] Later, as Yhwach is sleeping, Uryū tries to go to Yhwach's room. However, he is interrupted by Haschwalth before he can enter. Uryū, being questioned by Haschwalth regarding his intentions, states that he doesn't need to tell him about what he's going to ask Yhwach. Uryū then proceeds to note that Haschwalth is different from how he was during the day, prompting the Sternritter Grandmaster to state that he and Yhwach are different sides of the same scale, and that when Yhwach becomes the father of the Quincy, Haschwalth is given the mask of the ruler.[154] After Haschwalth tells him that all Quincy are connected to Yhwach and explains Yhwach's unique power and the way he can carve an initial directly into a person's soul, Uryū questions how this is possible, leading Haschwalth to say that Yhwach has already carved an initial into Uryū's soul through having him drink the cup filled with his blood. A shocked Uryū is pinned to the wall by Haschwalth who states that there is no way out of this for Uryū, and that even though he only joined the Wandenreich to avenge his mother, he hasn't had any way out since the beginning. Uryū then listens to Haschwalth as he explains Yhwach's need for battle and death and that all Sternritter live and die for their emperor.[155]Later, when Ichigo arrives in the Seireitei, Yhwach notes his appearance and informs Haschwalth and Uryū that they will begin.[156]As Uryū looks on as Haschwalth summons ""the key"", Yhwach says that they should be thankful to those who brought them to the light.[157] When Ichigo approaches the tower, Uryū steps forward and fires aHeilig Pfeilat him, prompting Ichigo to deflect it before realizing who fired it. As Ichigo expresses shock at his appearance, Uryū tells him to go home and states Ichigo cannot defeat Yhwach. When Ichigo demands to know why he is here, Uryū unleashesLicht Regenupon him, but the barrage is blocked bySanten Kesshunas Orihime and Sado emerge from aGarganta. Yhwach informs Uryū that this goodbye will be permanent, prompting Uryū to state he knows this as he, Yhwach, and Haschwalth ascend into the air before vanishing in a flash of light.[158]Soon afterward, Yhwach, Haschwalth, and Uryū arrive at the Soul King Palace.[159]After arriving, Uryū watches as Haschwalth summons severalSoldatto invade, and is later engulfed byTenjirō Kirinji's hot spring water.[160]As Haschwalth fights Kirinji, Uryū briefly scuffles withSenjumaru Shutarabefore being incapacitated.[161] Uryū partially manifests hisQuincy: Vollständig. Uryū later looks on in shock asŌetsu Nimaiya, Tenjirō Kirinji, andKirio Hikifuneslit their own throats to release theBlood Oath's Sealbinding them. As Senjumaru Shutara orders theSchutzstaffelto prepare themselves before activating her Bankai,Shatatsu Karagara Shigarami no Tsuji, Uryū finds himself sealed away in a tapestry alongside his fellow Quincy.[162]Shortly afterwards, Yhwach activatesThe Almightyand in the process Uryū manages to break free of Senjumaru's Bankai. After a short scuffle, Senjumaru once again binds Uryū with threads and prepares to kill him, only for Uryū to briefly activate hisQuincy: Vollständigand useAntithesisto seal Senjumaru inside her own Bankai and then kill her with aHeilig Pfeilthrough her heart.[163] Uryū arrives at the battle between Ichigo and Yhwach. Soon afterward, while Yhwach is fightingIchibē Hyōsube, Uryū listens as Haschwalth explainsThe Almightyto him.[164]Later, after Ichigo and his friends confront Yhwach, Uryū arrives and shoots Yoruichi in the shoulder, causing the barrier she had constructed to aid in the stabilization of theSoul Kingto shatter and sending the top half of the bifurcated Soul King flying toward Yhwach, who catches it. When Ichigo attempts to attack Yhwach, Uryū fires anotherHeilig Pfeilat him, distracting him long enough for Yhwach to ripMimihagioff of the Soul King. Uryū tells Ichigo to not interfere with Yhwach as Ichigo demands to know what he is doing.[165] Uryū fights Ichigo. As the palace begins to crumble, Uryū moves between Yhwach and his friends, whom he tells to not move if they do not want to be shot. When Uryū reveals that he knows why Ichigo and his friends are here and what will happen if Yhwach kills the Soul King, Ichigo demands to know why he is on Yhwach's side if he knows this, only for Uryū to claim that being a Quincy is his reason before promising that they can only stop Yhwach when he is dead. Uryū then proceeds to fight Ichigo, but is temporarily astonished to see Ichigo unconsciously shield himself against theHeilig PfeilwithBlut Vene. As Ichigo temporarily overpowers Uryū and demands that he stand down, only Uryū to berate Ichigo for wasting the perfect opportunity to kill him.[166] Uryū blasts a hole through Ichigo's side with a singleHeilig Pfeil. Uryū reiterates that the world does not need Shinigami and activates hisQuincy: Vollständig. Deciding to show Ichigo his resolve, Uryū continues their fight, eventually deciding to finish it and demonstrate his resolve by setting upSternenstaub. In response, a reluctant Ichigo lets his Reiatsu flow over his swords and fires aGetsuga Jūjishōjust as Uryū unleashesSternenstaub, causing the two projectiles to collide. Ultimately, theGetsuga Jūjishōoverwhelms theSternenstauband pushes it back toward Uryū, who calmly stands in place while theGetsuga Jūjishōnarrowly bypasses him. Calling Ichigo naïve, Uryū manifests hisHeilig Bogenand creates a normalHeilig Pfeilin his hand, which he draws back, as he refuses to let Ichigo kill Yhwach. Just as Ichigo prepares to attack him, Uryū fires theHeilig Pfeilthrough Ichigo's upper right side, leaving a large, jagged, and bloody hole while an aghast Ichigo falls out of the sky. Witnessing this, Gerard laughs heartily and accepts Uryū as one of theSchutzstaffelas Haschwalth stares down at him.[166] Later, the otherSchutzstaffelsit on couches in the palace as Uryū stands nearby. Noticing Uryū looks worried, Gerard assures him that Yhwach is going to completely absorb the Soul King without being harmed, which Uryū acknowledges.[167]After Yhwach completely absorbs the Soul King, Haschwalth informs Uryū and the others of this fact, to their surprise, before bringing them to the Soul King's chambers, where they find Yhwach oozing darkness. When Yhwach turns around to reveal that he has gained several more eyes, Uryū and the others are shocked. As the top of the palace shatters due to Yhwach's immense power, Uryū watches as Haschwalth asks Yhwach to lead them.[168] Afterwards, Uryū is present alongside Haschwalth and the other Sternritter when Yhwach explains the name of his new palace,Wahrwelt, and how it will be the cornerstone of their new world.[169]Later, a messenger informs Haschwalth that theSchutzstaffelhave each gone to a different part of the city, and that Uryū, who is among them, is heading towards the Second Junction of the city.[170] Haschwalth confronts Uryū. Uryū later returns to Yhwach's palace, and is greeted by Haschwalth, who says that he looks like he has a lot on his mind. Uryū reciprocates that, and Haschwalth reminds him that when Yhwach falls asleep, his powers switched with the emperor's. Haschwalth states that seeing Uryū's future worries him, and Uryū attempts to keep calm and convince him that nothing is happening, but Haschwalth will not say what he saw in the future. Haschwalth brings out little objects that Uryū scattered aroundWahrwelt, which Uryū denies knowing about. However, Haschwalth says they reminded him of theLeiden Hantthat was used by Sōken Ishida, and asks Uryū what he was doing by spreading these around. Uryū says that he has the wrong idea, and Haschwalth decides to prove whether Uryū is a traitor or not as he attacks the Quincy. Uryū dodges the strike and tells Haschwalth to wait, when he is suddenly face to face with Ichigo.[171] Ichigo attacks Uryū. Sado and Orihime also arrive as Uryū is told by Haschwalth to prove he is not a traitor by killing his three friends, though the Grandmaster already knows how he will respond. Uryū shoots two arrows at Ichigo, which the Shinigami dodges as he and Uryū clash head-on. Ichigo asks Uryū what he is trying to do as Uryū forces him flying back and shoots an arrow into the ground right in front of Ichigo, creating a large hole. Ichigo asks Uryū why he is siding with the Quincy, but Uryū says that telling him accomplishes nothing. Uryū tosses out hisSun Keyand reveals that by using it one could teleport to different Sun Gates inWahrwelt, as well as one Gate in the human world. Uryū tells Ichigo to take his friends into the human world as he will stay behind and take downWahrwelthimself, as once he activates the chips he had left throughout the citadel, the accumulated Reishi would be sure to destroy it. Ichigo shouts at Uryū that there was no need to do this and all they needed to do was destroy Yhwach, but Uryū replies that there is no way to defeat him and that this was something only he could do. The destruction chips were passed down to him from his master, meaning only his Reiatsu could activate them, and this would be their only way to win. Uryū tells Ichigo to move before Haschwalth notices, but Haschwalth steps forward, reminding Uryū that he knew what the Quincy was going to do.[172] Uryū begins fighting Haschwalth. As Haschwalth walks toward them, Uryū tells Ichigo to head for theSun Gate. However, Haschwalth reveals that he destroyed the one leading to the human world due to knowing what Uryū was planning. He then declares that he will deal with them before Yhwach wakes up, leading Uryū to realize that as long as Haschwalth possessesThe Almighty, Yhwach is no longer omniscient or omnipotent. He tells this to Ichigo, ordering him to go up to the top of the palace and confront Yhwach while he stays behind and deals with Haschwalth. Ichigo argues, but Uryū assures his friend that he will not die. As Ichigo, Orihime, and Sado run off, Uryū asks Haschwalth why he is not chasing them. Haschwalth replies that he knows they will perish, and Uryū says that fate could be changed. Haschwalth expresses his surprise at the change in Uryū's demeanor, and Uryū smugly remarks that Haschwalth failed to foresee this change and that he has yet to fully graspThe Almighty'spower. Haschwalth then attacks Uryū as the two begin to clash.[173] Uryū continues to engage Haschwalth despite his injuries. Uryū is heavily injured by Haschwalth during their battle, and attempts to fire aHeilig Pfeilat him, which the Grandmaster deflects. As morning breaks, Uryū states that Haschwalth missed his chance to take him down before the sun rose, but Haschwalth is incredulous about that, comparing Uryū to a tamed animal. Uryū takes the comparison as a compliment, but Haschwalth says that his powers are more suited to combat as he fires a blast of energy at a shocked Uryū.[174]Uryū later senses that Ichigo has confronted Yhwach up in the throne room.[175] Uryū is incapacitated by Haschwalth. Uryū is incapacitated by Haschwalth and lies bloodied on the floor as Haschwalth tells him about how his life is decided by scales, although he cannot tell what the scales have caused Uryū to become. Uryū gets to his knees and forms a newHeilig Bogenas he states that he himself will not know until all the Wandenreich has fallen.[176]Assuming a battle stance, Uryū asks Haschwalth why he is concerned about what kind of person Uryū is and points out that he should be trying to kill him instead of asking him so many questions. When Haschwalth reminds him that he has already seen a future where all of Uryū's allies die, Uryū states that this is subject to change as he proved earlier, prompting Haschwalth to admit that this is true before revealing thatThe Almightypossesses a far more terrifying ability than the power to see the future when used by Yhwach. As Uryū demands to know what he means, Haschwalth promises to tell him after they finish their battle before declaring that it is time for Uryū to place everything upon his broken scales as he attacks.[177] Haschwalth prepares to kill Uryū. Haschwalth further injures Uryū before revealing that hisSchriftisThe Balance, which allows him to distribute misfortune to the fortunate and redirect all misfortune that would occur to him into hisFreund Schild, a shield on his arm. As Haschwalth decides to finish Uryū off after observing that there is nothing left that he can do, Uryū asks Haschwalth if he wants to see hisSchrift. Haschwalth reasons that Uryū would have used hisSchriftby now if it were of any use in this battle, but Uryū names it asAntithesisas his wounds disappear and reappear on Haschwalth, who bleeds profusely while demanding to know what happened. Uryū explains thatAntithesisallows him to reverse something that has already happened between two targets, such as damage inflicted, leading Haschwalth to note that it may be the only power capable of stopping Yhwach. Shocked by this statement, Uryū demands to know if this has something to do with the true power ofThe Almighty, but Haschwalth merely claims that he was right to try and kill Uryū as soon as possible, prompting Uryū to attempt to leave the area. However, Haschwalth states that he will not let Uryū go so easily and usesThe Balanceto badly wound Uryū for having the good fortune of being able to injure Haschwalth himself. After explaining this, Haschwalth notes that the misfortune he suffers is absorbed into hisFreund Schildand redirected to Uryū, who is further injured. As Haschwalth declares that he has no way of winning, Uryū attempts to crawl away, prompting Haschwalth to note his tenacity before preparing to impale him as he states that Uryū is simply a human who desperately clings to his own beliefs.[178] Uryū manages to dodge Haschwalth's stab at the last minute before noting Haschwalth's comparison of him to his friends. Admitting that he has tried to remain calm and weigh his actions on scales up until this point, Uryū states that he cannot help but follow Ichigo's lead because he will help someone without question, which he notes is also true for Orihime, Sado, Renji, and Rukia. When Uryū claims that he would feel great joy if he began to resemble any one of them, Haschwalth dismisses his emotions before explaining that he was referring to Uryū's growth, as the single moment where Yhwach granted him power gave him far more growth than all the years he spent with his friends, and that it is more logical for him to side with Yhwach because of this. However, Uryū states that he chose to side with them not because it would benefit him, but because they were his friends. Angered by this, Haschwalth notes that Uryū never expected to give up anything in return for being taken in by Yhwach before declaring that Uryū will give Yhwach his life, only to be interrupted when anAuswählenbeam envelops him, surprising both him and Uryū.[179] Uryū receives an arrowhead made ofStill Silverfrom his father. Haschwalth collapses and, upon seeing a concerned Uryū looking at him, claims that he does not feel betrayed by Yhwach because the latter chose to take his power over Uryū's, which means only he can be an asset to Yhwach. When Uryū begins to walk away, Haschwalth asks him to come back so he can transfer Uryū's wounds to himself, shocking Uryū. Noting that he will die regardless of how wounded he is, Haschwalth reminds Uryū of how he puts everything on his scales because he might come to regret everything if he merely follows others without considering the consequences of his actions before telling him to save his friends.[180]As Uryū ascends to the Soul King Palace, he suddenly notices a presence, and aHeilig Pfeilis shot in front of him.Ryūken IshidaandIsshin Kurosakistand on a building above Uryū, who wonders what they are doing here. Ryūken tells Uryū to take the arrowhead that he shot in front of him, and Uryū notices something about the arrowhead. Ryūken reveals that this arrow is made from the silver that clots a Quincy's heart whenAuswählenis used on them, and tells Uryū that he is the one that should shoot this arrow.[181] Uryū then goes through Yhwach's portal from the Palace into the Seireitei and successfully shoots Yhwach from behind with the silver arrow. Uryū reflects on Ryūken telling him that he once heard Sōken say that the silver formed in a victim's heart by theAuswählencombined with the victim's blood will briefly stop Yhwach's powers. Uryū then tells Ichigo to go off and finish Yhwach, but gets crestfallen as Yhwach quickly recovers from the attack and regains his powers. However, Ichigo manages to cut Yhwach.[182] Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Uryū, now a doctor, takes a long lunch break on the roof of his workplace. He watches Sado's boxing match on his phone in order to make up for not being able to see it with his friends.[183]"

(Kuinsh Kurosu; Japanese for """,Equipment,"Uryū's new pentacle shaped cross. Quincy Cross: The Quincy cross is the source of a Quincy's power. As Uryū's power grows, so does his cross. Originally a simple cross,[185]it later became a pentacle after regaining his powers.[186] Seele Schneider. Seele Schneider: Uryū is highly capable of using the soul-cutting sword with great proficiency, easily defeating Cirucci Sanderwicci with it, despite his lack of practice beforehand .[95] Hollow Bait: Typically used by Quincy to aid in the extermination of low-level Hollows. It attracts them when the flat, round tablet is crushed and scattered. Uryū uses it to summon Hollows to Karakura Town during his duel with Ichigo Kurosaki.[187] Silber Draht:[188]A silver wire that Uryū conceals around his right arm after losing his powers to theQuincy: Letzt Stil. Uryū uses it to fight aMenos Grandethat attacks him.[189] Anti-Arrancar Mine: After rescuing Uryū from Szayelaporro,Mayuri Kurotsuchigives Uryū a landmine he created, which is designed for use againstArrancar. Once its sensors pick up an Arrancar's Reiatsu, it detonates violently. Uryū subsequently uses it on the EspadaYammy Llargo, critically injuring the Arrancar in his sealed state; the explosion was very powerful.[190][191] Leiden Hant: In order to match more powerful opponents he would face in Soul Society, Uryū trained using his grandfather's gift: the Sanrei Glove. Upon completing the necessary week of endurance training wearing the glove, his power drastically increased.[192]He manifested a different bow and increased all of his attributes, easily overpowering a Shinigami captain. The glove dissipated upon removal.[193] Hakumen Kudashi:[194]Putting theAnti-Arrancar Minedeveloped by Mayuri to practical use, Uryū detonates the landmine in a such a manner that it not only inflicts significant injury to an opponent, but also destroys the ground beneath them.[190]When used againstYammy Llargo, in order to maximize the damage and protract the Espada's subsequent fall, Uryū weakened the lower levels of the structure that they were in.[191] Still Silver Arrowhead: Uryū's father,Ryūken Ishida, has managed to collect the silver blood clot fromhis wife'sheart that was formed from theAuswählenand forged an arrowhead out of it. During the final stages of the Blood War, Ryūken delivered this arrowhead to Uryū, telling him that he is the one who should shootYhwachwith it.[195]"
What weapon does Ury use to block Senjumaru's blows?,Blut Veneto,Powers & abilities,"AuswählenImmunity: According to Yhwach, Uryū is the onlyGemischt Quincyto have survived the effects of his Auswählen nine years ago.[196]Uryū not only survived, but he also retained all of his powers, unlike some Sternritter who lost powers due to the Auswählen.[197] Reishi Manipulation: As a Quincy, he primarily absorbs spiritual energy from the atmosphere, and combines it with his own spiritual energy to form weapons.[198]He has an easier time collecting this energy in environments with higher concentrations of Reishi such as inSoul SocietyorHueco Mundo.[199]He can manipulate spiritual energy for offensive purposes. Uryū commonly reshapes spiritual particles into various types of bow and arrows, but can also concentrate spiritual energy into the form of swords or Gintō. Uryū usingBlut Veneto block Senjumaru's blows. Gintō Expert: He is able to use the spiritual energy stored in the silver tubes to create similar effects toKidō; Uryū can even use his own energy, rather than the energy stored in the silver tube. Gintō was his primary weapon of choice, albeit only, against an incomplete Arrancar during the Arrancar Invasion. He was only able to injure it before his father saved him, but this feat alone was great, as he could not use any of his Quincy abilities at the time.[80] Master Archer: When a Quincy becomes more skilled using their Bow andHeilig Pfeil, they gain more power and precision with their arrows. This is similar to how a marksman gains skill and hits the target more frequently. Uryū Ishida has greatly increased his power and skill throughout his association withIchigo Kurosaki, and is a prime example of this growth. He has great accuracy, able to instantly kill Hollows with one arrow. During theRyoka Invasion, he fightsJirōbō Ikkanzaka, another projectile-type user, and easily defeats him. After defeating him, Uryū effortlessly fires two arrows through hisSaketsuandHakusui,[204]and does the same toCirucci Sanderwicciat the end of their fight.[205] Expert Swordsman: During his fight with Cirucci Sanderwicci, Uryū uses Seele Schneider as a sword expertly, and easily defeats her with it. Even though it is really an arrow, and his main prowess lies in archery and Quincy techniques, it is clear that Uryū has some ability with the sword.[95] Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant: While preferring to fight at mid to long-range to make full use of his Quincy powers, Uryū is also a highly capable close-range and bare-handed fighter. When a street gang came to Karakura High School to cause trouble, Uryū calmly approached them, and showed his skill by easily subduing them . Likewise he managed to defend from Senjumaru's Zanpakutō using hand-to-hand moves. Like his weapon style, Uryū's bare-handed style is more about precise strikes than brute force.[208] Spiritual Awareness: As a Quincy, Uryū can sense Hollows at a significant distance. He sensed a new Hollow in an area before eitherRukia KuchikiandIchigo Kurosakisensed its arrival. He also knew which direction it was in.[209] Great Spiritual Power: Even before Uryū joined Yhwach's army as aSternritterandSchutzstaffelmember, he displayed a high amount of spiritual energy.[210]He has mastered the Quincy ability of Reiryoku absorption, taking in spirit particles and spirit energy alike. This, on top of his ownenergyreserves, lends him plenty of strength in combat. When his father restored his powers, Uryū's spiritual force proves so great that it took them a week or so to finish, and his father still needed todrawout a stronger arrow to restore his powers and exhaust him completely.[82]Even before joining Yhwach's army, the Wandenreich, who had thoroughly compiled the data of numerous Shinigami and living Quincy in theirDaten, believed that Uryū's power was at least on par with a Sternritter.[211]After joining Yhwach's army, Uryū's spiritual power becomes comparable to that of a captain-level Shinigami, proven when he is designated as Yhwach's successor,[7]defends Yhwach from Ichigo and his friends,[212]and battlesJugram Haschwalth, the Sternritter Grandmaster, for a significant amount of time.[213]Uryū's powers were bolstered further when Yhwach usedAuswählento redistribute power from the abandoned Sternritter to revive and strengthen theSchutzstaffel.[214][215]His Reiatsu is light-blue.[216] Shadow: A Quincy technique that allows the user to move between dimensions using shadows. Uryū used this ability to collect the defeatedCang DuandBG9.[153] Excellent Intellect: Aside from his Quincy powers, Uryū has an equally well-trained mind, having a genius intellect. He uses his intelligence to find weak points in his opponents, even overcoming disadvantages he has through thinking on his feet.[217]He is able to deduce Ichigo's spiritual level, that Ichigo acquired his Shinigami powers in mid-May, and Rukia Kuchiki's real identity.[218]"
What is the name of Ury's new bow? A: Kojaku. B: Sanrei Glove. C: Sanrei Kojaku. D: Sanrei Kojaku.,Kojaku,Former powers & abilities,"Uryū firing arrows from his bow Kojaku. Kojaku: Uryū's first bow, Kojaku's size is dependent on the amount of energy flowing through it. With this bow, Uryū is able to kill most Hollows in a single strike.[229]HisHeilig Pfeilcan also split apart mid-flight and strike multiple targets.[230]As preparation for his travel to Soul Society, Uryū later masters theSanrei Glove, greatly increasing his abilities. In this state, his Kojaku is solid, and is covered in an intricate pattern. It is attached to his glove by a series of thin struts. This new bow allows Uryū to fire several shots simultaneously. By removing the glove, Uryū attains the Quincy: Letzt Stil. This gives him a vast increase in power, enough to defeat a captain class Shinigami with Bankai in only one shot. All the extra energy collects on his right shoulder, much like how a quiver is worn. As a result of removing the glove, however, the Quincy: Letzt Stil uses too much power for Uryū's body to handle, causing his body to block his Quincy powers completely after it wears off. Uryū's new bow,Ginrei Kojaku. Ginrei Kojaku: After Uryū regains his powers with the aid of his father; he uses this new Quincy cross, this one resembling a pentacle, and a variant of his original bow. This bow is first used during his battle with theArrancarAisslinger Wernarr[231], and several of its special abilities were later used in his fight againstCirucci Sanderwicci. Unlike his original bow, this bow is shaped like a spider's web. Uryū displaying his new bow after firing at Kūgo. Heilig Bogen: 17 months after the defeat of Aizen, Uryū has a new bow. It is smaller in size, resembling his father's. An arrow forms down the middle of each side of the bow, with a line that crosses it near the center.[236] Uryū using Quincy: Letzt Stil. Uryū used this transformation once at the cost of his powers. It greatly enhances his power, to the point where he easily overwhelms Mayuri Kurotsuchi, nearly killing him before his escape. Currently, hecannot use this techniqueagain.[69]In this form, his standard uniform completely changes. He now wears a white vest which is parted in the middle. Armor appears on his left shoulder, sporting a cross-like design, which spreads across his chest. He gains a white cloth, covered in several line designs, which covers his lower half. From his right shoulder, a wing made of Reiryoku forms.[238]Uryū can gather Reishi for bow formation from this wing.[239]"

Orihime is independent, friendly, humorous, optimistic, sensitive, caring and kind. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which contradicts her exceptionally high marks as third highest in her grade.[11]She studies hard because when her grades drop, she receives less financial support from her relatives.[12]She is a member of the Handicrafts Club[13]and likes to invent very ridiculous sports to play withTatsuki.[14]She tends to zone out with her mouth open and loses track of what she was thinking or dreaming about.

How old was Orihime when Sora died?,three years old,History,"A young Orihime. Orihime and her brother,Sora Inoue, were raised by a drunken father and a prostitute mother, who always argued and beat their children. Fearing that their parents would kill Orihime, in the March that Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her on his own from then on.[20][12][21]For nine years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her unusual hair color. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. That day, Sora died, and Orihime began wearing the hairpins every day since.

After Ichigo denies this, Orihime says that her intuition was wrong and that she allowed it to get her worried.[177] At her apartment, Orihime notes that her face is still red and expresses her surprise that Ichigo had invited her inside, idealizing what actually happened. She says that Ichigo is so nice for telling her to pick out the bread she liked to bring it home. Spinning around, she becomes dizzy and falls, knocking over her picture of Sora. She picks up the picture and apologizes before affirming that Ichigo is hiding something. Her phone rings, startling her. She answers, finding that it is Uryū.[178]Ichigo arrives at Karakura Hospital to find Orihime already there. He asks after Sado, but Orihime tells him that he did not answer his phone. Seeing that she called Ichigo, Uryū says that she is taking things too far. After they and Ryūken talk about his injuries, Uryū tells them that he cannot tell them anything and asks them to go home. When Ichigo offers to walk Orihime home, Ryūken tells him that he will drive her home. Ryūken tells Orihime that Ichigo does not seem to able to help and informs her that he examined the Reiatsu left in Uryū by the attacker. He reveals that the attacker was not a Hollow or Shinigami, but rather was something that he had not encountered before. He theorizes that the assailant was a Human with powers, similar to Orihime and Sado. Noting that Quincy broadly fall into this category, he warns her that she or Sado might be in danger.[179] Tsukishimaappears behind Orihime. At school the following day, Orihime asks Ichigo if he knows anything about Sado's condition. Ichigo inquires if he is sick. Orihime tells him that she went to his class to inform him about what had happened to Uryū, but it seems that Sado has not been in school lately. She tells him that she was planning to take a get well present to him after school and invites Ichigo, who declines. She tells him that it is too short notice and that she will let him know about Sado condition. Ichigo thanks her and walks off. At Sado's home, Orihime finds that Sado is not in. She remembers Ryūken's warning, but quickly dismisses such negative thoughts and leaves some bread and prays for him.[180]Orihime remarks that Ichigo and Chad still haven't returned to school before being challenged byMoe Shishigawara, who tells her to die.[181] Orihime comes betweenShishigawaraand Tsukishima when he produces hisFullbring. Moe moves in for the kill, but flings himself away when he sees how beautiful she is. Believing him to be Uryū's attacker, she becomes angry; Moe notes that he can fight her when she acts as such. However,Shūkurō Tsukishimaappears behind her and orders Shishigawara to stop.[182]Demanding to know who Tsukishima is, she decides to get in between him and Shishigawara when it appears he might hurt him, even though he has brought out his sword. She asks him if it is a Zanpakutō, but is told that it is hisFullbring. Orihime tells him that if he was the one who attacked Uryū, then she cannot let him get away.[183]Orihime attempts to use her powers when Tsukishima turns away, however, he appears behind her and seemingly cuts her from her left shoulder down through her chest.[184]However, when Sado and Ichigo arrive, she is unharmed despite being sure she had felt the cut from the sword. Concerned for Ichigo, whom she thinks is powerless, she brushes off his concern while deciding to text Sado with the information later. For a moment, she believes that Tsukishima is her friend, making her wonder what she was slashed by.[185] Talking with Sado on her phone, Orihime tells him that she is certain she was cut, but by the time she came to, Tsukishima and Shishigawara were gone and there was no wound. She reveals that when Sado and Ichigo arrived on the scene she thought for a second that Tsukishima was her friend. She says that she does not understand it and rather than mistaking him for a friend, it felt like an old memory, leaving Sado shocked. Orihime tells him to be careful as she believes that Tsukishima's power is scary. She then gives him her attackers' names, though she mistakenly says Shishigawara's name asSushigawara.[186] Orihime visits Uryū in the hospital to heal him. Orihime goes to the hospital to visit Uryū on his request. When she arrives he apologizes for his brash attitude last time they spoke and asks that she heal his injuries because he senses the change in Ichigo's Reiatsu. Orihime confirms that she senses it as well, but has decided to let Ichigo tell her when he's ready before informing Uryū that she was attacked by the same person who attacked him.[187]They discuss the differing abilities they were attacked with and she is able to inform him that Tsukishima's abilities were called""Fullbring""as Uryū had mistaken them for Zanpakutō. On the way home, she meets with Sado, who asks that she tell him all about Uryū as they walk home. She confirms that while the Reiatsu surrounding his injuries was different from anything she'd seen, she was able to heal him.[188] Orihime is confronted by Riruka Dokugamine. Chad brings Orihime to Xcution's temporary hideout andRiruka Dokugaminejumps down, asking questions about her healing abilities and if she's here for Ichigo's training. She then tells Orihime that if she heals Ichigo he'll just get injured again and allow him to endure endless pain. Orihime then asks Riruka if she's worried about Ichigo as well, which she denies angrily. Orihime says she understands Riruka, but has left those worries behind a long time ago. She further says if Ichigo needs her help, she will use her powers to help him, no matter what. Riruka then asks Orihime what she'd do if he is hurt beyond her abilities to heal, and Orihime says she'll never allow that and will heal it all, no matter how hopelessly injured he gets. Orihime then enters Yukio's Fullbring, prompting Kūgo to call her thehealing item.[189] Orihime usesShiten Kōshunagainst Kūgo. As Orihime introduces herself, she is directed towards a heavily injured Ichigo. She rushes towards him and begins to heal him.[190]After some time, Orihime has almost fully restored Ichigo's health. Kūgo, however, states that she is taking too long. She pleads with him to wait, but he declines, asking Ichigo if he's ready. When Ichigo says yes, Kūgo rushes him. Orihime steps in front of Ichigo, erecting a barrier. Ichigo calls out, asking her to stop, while Kūgo mocks her attempt to stop his Cross of the Scaffold Fullbring with Santen Kesshun. Orihime simply tells him that he's wrong - Kūgo questions her meaning as he strikes the barrier, and is instantly cut by a blast of energy. He falls back, grunting in pain, as Orihime explains that she usedShiten Kōshunto block his attack. Ichigo begins to question Orihime on her new ability. She tells him that over the seventeen months he was without his spiritual abilities, both she and Chad had been constantly improving. She claims that they knew Ichigo would eventually regain his powers, and that neither of them would let themselves fall behind again. Ichigo says he understands, thanks Orihime and moves to combat Kūgo.[191] Orihime and Riruka talk over doughnuts. Riruka enters Yukio's Fullbring with a box of doughnuts. Seeing Orihime crouched on the floor watching Ichigo and Kūgo fighting, she asks why she is sitting on the floor. Orihime replies that there are no walls or pillars to lean on. Riruka demands that Yukio quickly create a table and chairs for her and Orihime. He refuses, but when Orihime politely asks for a chair for herself, he accedes to the request. As she is eating her doughnuts, Riruka notices Orihime staring longingly at them. Initially refusing to give her any, she soon relents. Orihime wolfs down the whole thing, leading to Riruka criticizing her and wondering how her parents cope with her. Orihime reveals that Sora took her away when she was a baby because he feared they would kill her. Riruka asks if he supports her, but she tells him that he died and that a distant relative supports her financially. Riruka says that she is no fun to talk with and starts to leave. She tells Orihime that there must be something wrong with her to be able to talk so nonchalantly about it. However, Orihime replies that she has already been saved and that she can talk as she had been doing because of Ichigo. When Orihime points out there are still some doughnuts left, Riruka tells her that she can have them instead. Orihime thanks her and tells her that she is really nice.[192] Orihime is trapped by Yukio. When Kūgo slashes Ichigo's eyes, Orihime tries to help him, but Kūgo stops her. He tells her to watch and notes that when Ichigo lost his powers he also lost his resolve. He tells Ichigo that he will bring that back to him.[193]Yukio traps her inside a cage at Kūgo's behest. He tells Orihime that her voice cannot be heard from outside the cage and that it cannot be broken due to the game's rules. He then notices that he cannot hear her either.[194]After Ichigo completes his Fullbring, Orihime awakens in a house inside of Yukio's Fullbring. She gets up and brushes her teeth before looking out the window at Ichigo's training. Riruka comes in and brings her breakfast without knocking first and Orihime tells her that she came in before she said alright. Riruka tells her to shut up and gives her her breakfast. Orihime excitedly asks Riruka to join her, but Riruka says she just had doughnuts. Orihime grabs her hot dog and says that Riruka eats a lot of doughnuts before taking a bite.[195]She later leaves Yukio's Fullbring along with Ichigo and Sado.[196] Orihime'sSanten Kesshunprotects Tsukishima.

Later, Orihime runs to Ichigo, who she had heard crying. She wonders why Ichigo and Tsukishima are fighting when they are ""best friends.""

She spots Ichigo and is relieved to see that he is not crying. She also notices Rukia, Renji and Hitsugaya and assumes that they are there to stop Ichigo. However, Sado notes that they look as if they intend to help Ichigo and kill Kūgo. Tsukishima abruptly appears behind the two, sensing their uncertainty, and attempts to alter their memories further. As a result, she is nearly pushed to the brink of mental breakdown before she is knocked out and rendered unconscious by Urahara.[202]She and Sado are brought to Urahara's shop and after Tsukishima is defeated, they become stable. They are left in the care of Tessai and Isshin.[203] At Urahara's Shop, Orihime greets Riruka as she wakes up, expressing her happiness over her well-being. She tells her that they couldn't find any of the other Fullbringers, but that at least she is alright. Riruka asks about Tsukishima, but Orihime says she doesn't know who that is - an unwitting confirmation that Tsukishima was killed. In the revelation, Riruka starts tearing up.

Where was Sado born?,"Okinawa, Japan",History,"Sado was born inOkinawa, Japan, but was taken to Mexico by his parents at a young age. After their deaths, Sado was adopted at the age of eight byOscar Joaquín de la Rosa, a man believed to be his grandfather since Sado calls himAbuelo.[9] During his early years, Sado was extremely violent; exploiting his advantage in size, he intimidated and hit any other children who annoyed him. Oscar Joaquín tried to teach Sado to be gentle, but was initially unsuccessful.[9]One day, the fathers of the children Sado fought, seeking to punish him, attacked Sado. Oscar Joaquín stepped in between them, taking Sado's punishment without retaliation. Sado was inspired by this example to become a decent person. To commemorate this event, Oscar Joaquín gave Sado an old Mexican coin; years later, when Oscar Joaquín had died, Sado made a vow that he would never fight unless it was to protect others, as instructed — even if his own life was in danger.[10]The coin would come to symbolize this vow, which Sado now claims to hold more value than his own life.[9] Ichigo risking his life to protect Sado's coin.

When the gang was defeated, Chad and Ichigo made a pact to fight for each other and protect one another.[12] Because they were constantly involved with fights and brawls with thugs and delinquents, both Ichigo and Chad gained the reputation of hardened thugs themselves. Their reputation far exceeded that of violent youths as they were made up to be juvenile gangsters of sorts. On their first day of high school, Chad and Ichigo were forced into pushing back a gang of thugs led byReiichi Ōshima, who was hell-bent on proving his bravado by beating up such a menacing duo.

Sado, hearing the noise, asks if she is okay. She tells him that she is and apologizes.

Orihime reveals that when Sado and Ichigo arrived on the scene she thought for a second that Tsukishima was her friend. She says that she does not understand it and rather than mistaking him for a friend, it felt like an old memory, leaving Sado shocked. Orihime tells him to be careful as she believes that Tsukishima's power is scary. Sado agrees and then asks for the two attackers' names and he tells him their names, though she mistakenly says Shishigawara's name asSushigawara.[122] After speaking with Orihime, Sado meets with Ginjō at the Xcution headquarters. Ginjō tells him that Ichigo had already started his next training phase. Sado asks what Tsukishima's abilities are.[123]Sado explains what Orihime told him and suspects that Tsukishima's Fullbring can alter the memories of those it cuts.[124]Ginjō, however, says that he already told Sado everything he knew about Tsukishima's Fullbring, and if he already knew about it, then he would have told Sado already. He tells him that Tsukishima's Fullbring is calledBook of the End, and that it has an attack power so high that it can literally cut through anything, but it is the only thing that it can do. Sado asks if his Fullbring could have evolved since they last met, and Ginjō says that they cannot; Fullbring abilities cannot and will not change through growth. Sado argues that his Fullbring changed many times. Ginjō, however, explains that means that Sado simply could not access his Fullbring to its fullest ability until he reached a level that he could, and that the rest of the members of Xcution had surpassed that stage a long time ago. Ginjō also explains that Orihime's explanation worries him, because to the best of his knowledge, Tsukishima's Fullbring didn't cause Orihime's memory distortion. Ginjō then asks about Uryū's condition, surprising Sado. Ginjō reminds Sado that Uryū was attacked and asks if he has the same memory problems. Sado tells him that Uryū apparently did not suffer the same memory distortion as Orihime did. Ginjō tells Sado that they had better be sure, because if Uryū is suffering from the same memory distortion, then they need to be worried about Tsukishima's abilities. However, if Uryū is not suffering from the conditions as Orihime, then whoever attacked Orihime may not have been Tsukishima at all.[125] Sado attacksTsukishima.

Ichigo attacks Tsukishima and asks who he is. Sado realizes the dangers of not knowing who Tsukishima is and attacks him after he identifies himself to Ichigo. Sado lands on the roof and Ginjō scolds him, remarking that they can now tell Ichigo about Tsukishima. Sado remarks that it would be a risk, as they do not know how powerful Ichigo's Fullbring is yet, nor do they know how much control he has over it. He further explains that if they explain what he did to Orihime, then his performance might suffer. Ichigo, however, overhears this and realizes that they only avoided telling Ichigo anything because they were trying to protect him, which he did not realize. Tsukishima lands on the rooftop as well, causing Ichigo to attack him. As Ichigo fights, Sado notes that Ichigo progressed immensely on his Fullbring training. However, Tsukishima gains the upper hand in their fight, causing Ginjō to stop his attack with his own Fullbring.[127] Sado later stops Ichigo from trying to interfere with Ginjō and Tsukishima's fight.

He responds that it is Orihime and Riruka grins a little. Riruka talks to Orihime and says that Sado told them about her. Sado tries to get her to stop antagonizing Orihime, but she continues before Orihime points out Riruka's feelings for Ichigo and then says that she will heal Ichigo no matter what and they all continue on up to Yukio.[130] Sado enters the training room that Yukio made for him. After Orihime enters Yukio's game, Ichigo says that Sado must have brought her there. Sado enters and says that he did and that he knows Ichigo did not want to get her involved, but he will need her. Ginjō begins saying something to Sado but he interrupts saying that he did not come there to back up Ichigo. He says he had Yukio make him his own room where he can train, saying he cannot afford to sit around if he wants to fight Tsukishima again. Ginjō acknowledges this and tells him to do as he will. He enters the room and reflects on the encounter with Tsukishima and remembers that he was attacked by Tsukishima, but no one noticed he was stabbed. He says that everything is how Orihime described it and that Tsukishima's powers are a mystery and that he needs to gain more power if he is going to fight back.[131]Once Ichigo finishes his training, Sado leaves Yukio's Fullbring along with Ichigo and Orihime.[132] Sado attacks Ichigo.

He asks Ichigo why he's attacking Tsukishima, and both him and Orihime tell him that he only saved Rukia and defeated Aizen because Tsukishima helped him. Tsukishima appears behind Ichigo and asks him if he understands, but Ichigo lashes out at him[134]Ichigo continues to attack Tsukishima, but Orihime stops his attack with herSanten Kesshun.

Tsukishima then comes behind Sado and Orihime and asks them if they doubt their memories. Tsukishima asks Orihime who protected her from her parents and raised her, and he asks Sado who gave him his coin. He answers that he did both. Ginjō tries to stop Tsukishima from saying anything else, but then Sado and Orihime both feel strange.

How did Sado feel when he entered Hueco Mundo?,the power inside him rustling,Fullbring,"Brazo Derecha de Gigante .[203]Originally it was thought that by encountering the spiritual form ofIchigo Kurosakiconstantly, Sado's natural spiritual powers were pulled from the depths of his soul.[204]This power is actually a product ofFullbring.[205]Upon entering Hueco Mundo, Sado felt the power inside him rustling, something he never felt while in Soul Society. The rustling increased the deeper he went into Hueco Mundo, and it was the beating he received from Gantenbainne that caused the rustling to settle down. Upon coming to Hueco Mundo, his power had been happily crying out like it had come home, and through the violent welcome of its brethren had reclaimed its sanity. Sado acknowledges that his power is less like a Shinigami's or Quincy's and more like that of a Hollow.[206]This allowed him to fully tap into his powers, which manifest as armor on both arms, instead of just his right. Sado states that when he first used his power, it awoke because of the pride that had been instilled in his heart byOscar Joaquín de la Rosa, and that the object that acted as the source of his Fullbring was the skin on his arms.[207]Originally, he could only activate this power from his need to protect.[208]Later, during his training under Yoruichi Shihōin, Sado learns to activate his powers at will.

What is the name of Goku's adoptive full name?,Sn Wùkng,Concept and creation,"The original incarnation of Goku in theDragon BallprototypeDragon BoywasTangtong. The original inspirations for that story wereHong Kong martial arts films, includingBruce Leefilms such asEnter the Dragon andJackie Chanfilms such asDrunken Master;[24][25]Toriyamalater said he had a young Jackie Chan in mind for a live-action Goku, stating that ""nobody could play Goku but him.""[26] TheDragon Balluniverse began as a loose adaptation of the classic Chinese novelJourney to the West, with Goku himself as an alternate take onSun Wukong. Similarities between the two include their mischievous nature and possession of thePower PoleandFlying Nimbus.[27] Akira Toriyama's original design of Goku When Toriyama started his first draft ofDragon Ball, he originally planned on making Goku a fullmonkeyto make the series more faithful toJourney to the West. During Toriyama's second draft, Goku was instead a full human dressed in sailor clothes that rode a flight mecha instead of the Flying Nimbus.[27]Toriyama's third draft became the final design. Goku's adoptive full name is also based on the traditional Mandarin Chinese full name 孫悟空 . The name孫悟空 is simply the Japanese on'yomi rendering of 孫悟空 , as Chinese and Japanese share the same characters but with different pronunciations. 孫 /孫 is a common Chinese/Japanese surname that normally means ""grandchild"", while 悟空 /悟空 is a common Buddhist name that means ""perceiving air/awakened to emptiness"". Reading ""孫悟空"" via the first and final characters only through the Japanese kun'yomi rendering system makes it read out as ""Mago Gosora"", used at some point as a gag in the original manga's run by theWorld Tournament Announcer. Goku was revealed a month before theDragon Ballmanga started, in postcards sent to members of the Akira Toriyama Preservation Society.[28] Goku's first appearance was on the last page of ""Grand Finale"", the last chapter of theDr. Slumpmanga, advertisingDragon Ball'supcoming debut. Goku's Saiyan birth name, Kakarot,is a pun on ""carrot"".Goku's family, like most Saiyans, are all named after root vegetables or even the word ""vegetable"" itself. While Goku is an overall good person, Akira Toriyama designed him as one who fights mostly for personal joy of challenging strong opponents. To which, Toriyama notes that the anime tends to go overboard in making Goku look heroic, and that his original depiction of Goku in the manga has certain ""poisonous"" traits.[29][30] The primary reason why Akira Toriyama created hisSuper Saiyanstate with blond hair was so that his assistant would no longer have to spend so much time coloring Goku's hair black. Due to also having the effect of making Goku appear stronger, it killed two birds with one stone.[4] Goku's Super Saiyan form was heavily influenced by the martial artist Bruce Lee. According to Toriyama, Goku's piercing eyes were based on Lee's paralyzing glare.[31]Dragon Ball Zanime character designerTadayoshi Yamamuroalso used Lee as a reference for Goku's Super Saiyan form, stating that, when he ""first becomes a Super Saiyan, his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee.""[32]"
How old was Goku when he had a significant growth spurt?,"By age 15, he began showing noticeable increases in height. By age 18, Goku began showing noticeable increases in height.",Appearance,"Goku as a child, an adult, Super Saiyan, and Super Saiyan 3 Goku looks almost exactly likehis father, possessing the same spiky black hairstyle, dark-colored eyes, and facial features. However, he has softer eyes, a kind demeanor, and a lighter-pale skin complexion fromhis mother. Goku's most distinguishing physical characteristic is his hair. He has three bangs hanging to the right of his forehead and two bangs hanging to the left. His hair also stands up in the front with four spikes and three bangs in the back . Goku was born with the signaturetailof theUniverse 7Saiyans, which was long and prehensile with brown fur. It was removed and regrown multiple times in his early childhood, but in his late teens, Goku's tail was permanently removed byKamiin order to prevent hisGreat Apetransformation. At age 12, Goku was rather short and appeared even younger than he was, being considered less than 10 years old . His somewhat simple-minded personality also gave people the impression that he was as young as he looked. During the next few years, Goku did not go through any physical changes, other than his muscles becoming more pronounced. By age 15, he began showing noticeable increases in height. By age 18, he had a considerable growth spurt, growing taller than some of his friends and developing a well-built physique. He is also considered very handsome, as noted by various women includingBulmaandHeles. His physical changes made him almost indistinguishable from before and was only recognized by his signature naïve personality and ""trademark"" hairstyle. By age 25, Goku had another growth spurt, and became about similar in height to his taller human allies and much more muscular. Due to his love of training, he is most commonly seen wearing aGi. Originally, Goku wore a blue gi secured with a white bow-tied obi over his waist, red wristbands, and dark blue kung fu shoes. He later wore a white tank top while training underMaster Roshi. Following this, Goku wore the basicTurtle School Uniform, consisting of a red gi secured by a black knot-tied obi over his waist, blue wristbands, and blue kung fu shoes. On the left breast and back there is a yellow patch with Roshi'skanji. After training withKamiandMr. Popo, Goku wore a black short-sleeved undershirt with this gi and replaced his shoes with dark blue boots with a yellow border and red laces. InDragon Ball Z, the patches containing the Turtle School kanji became white. After training underKing Kai, Goku wore King Kai's kanji on the back of his top. During theFrieza Saga, Goku wore his own kanji on both sides of his top. During theCellandBuu Sagas, Goku wore a plainer version of this gi that lacked any kanji and featured a blue sash-style obi over his waist, as well as the same dark blue undershirt, same wristbands and the same boots from his previous gi, but with a red border and yellow/tan laces. He later retains this outfit throughout most ofDragon Ball Super, while also regaining his own kanji on both sides of his gi shirt. During his early training underWhis, Goku wore anorange traditional and loose gi with Whis' kanjiover the left breast, secured by a blue obi tied in a knot at the left of his waist. He also wore blue wristbands that cover nearly his entire forearms and blue boots with a black toe cap and heel that clasp together on the front of his shins. He returned to his original Gi with the ""Go"" symbol after the Universe 6 Saga. InDragon Ball Super: Broly, Goku returns to wearing a knot-style obi with his regular uniform with the kanji ""Go"" on the chest, essentially regaining hisFrieza Sagaappearance. His shoes were also rounder at the bottom and had gray soles. In addition, to compensate for the wintery climate he is on, he also wears a long blue snow jacket with a high turtleneck, white stripes down his shoulders and arms and bold purple letters of ""SAB"" over the front-left side of it. It also has black gloves. In theGalactic Patrol Prisoner Saga, Goku is given the emblem of theGalactic Patrolin place of his own on the front of his uniform and also switches back to wearing a sash-style obi. In theGranolah the Survivor Saga, Goku regains Whis' kanji on his standard gi when theangeltrains him in honingUltra Instinct. When he appears in thePrison Planet Saga, Goku wears an outfit identical to the one Whis gave him, but instead with aCapsule Corplogo. He also wears a blue t-shirt underneath his gi. In theUniversal Conflict Saga, he wears an outfit identical to the Grand Minister's. The attire consists of a dark blue long-sleeved shirt with an orange circle over the chest, with baggy shoulder pads that runs beneath his red-colored belt with his kanji on the round belt-buckle. The shirt is complimented by a matching color pair of jodhpur-like pants, and white boots that run beneath his shins. In theUniverse Creation Saga, Goku's attire is the same from the previous arc but this time, it has a lighter tone of orange, and his t-shirt, belt, wristbands, and the blue parts of his boots become black. Later on, in theNew Space-Time War Saga, after being released from the Demon'sHyperbolic Time Chamber, Goku returns withVegetawith theDark Empire's logo imprinted on his gi. By the28th World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku wears a light blue tunic with a white knot-style obi, dark green pants, orange wristbands, orange leg wraps, and black kung fu shoes. In the cover of the ""Goodbye, Dragon World"" volume of the manga, this outfit's color is different. The gi is lime green, his wristbands are purple, his pants are cyan, and he wears the boots from his previous outfit, albeit purple. Despite his fighting gi being his preferred look, Goku is not without other types of wardrobes, such as a suit and tie,[33]casual clothes like blue pants with a button-down red shirt, or an orange and black jacket with a white sleeveless undershirt, light green pants and brown shoes. When returning home to prepare for the androids, Goku wore an outfit similar to one from his youth, a white tank top with periwinkle Chinese pants with a white sash and purplish brown toe shoes and white socks. His farmer attire consists of light beige collared denim jacket with a white scarf around his neck and a charcoal gray short sleeved undershirt, light beige pants with a black belt around his waist and black boots. The sleeves on his jacket have been folded into white cuffs. InDragon Ball GT, Goku's skin tone got a noticeable tan. His general outfit is very similar to his outfit at the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament, being a blue tunic with a white knot-style obi, yellow pants, pink wristbands, white leg wraps, and black kung fu shoes. Due to the carelessness ofEmperor Pilaf, Goku was wished back into a 12-year-old. While essentially looking the same as he did back then, Goku showed considerably more defined muscle. Later, with the aid ofOld Kai, Goku regenerates his tail, which would poke out from his pants. 100 years later at the64th World Martial Arts Tournament, despite growing back to his physical prime without transforming, he was not still seen with his tail. However, in one ending, he is seen with a tail in adult form. During which, he wears the outfit from the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament. He also wears hisPower Poleagain. When re-grown up,GTGoku appears inthe Adventure Mode ofExtreme Butōden, he wears his classic outfit fromDragon Ball Super. InDragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child, an infant Goku was seen wearing a standardBattle Armorof theFrieza Forcewhen being sent toEarth. It is the standard model of armor worn by Saiyans at the time, consisting of a black chest piece with white accents and beige panels on the stomach and lower back, plus beige shoulder and hip guards. In addition, he had bright blue shorts, black arm and leg bracers with white edges and white boots with a striped, beige toe cap and a gray sole."
What is Goku's mother's name?,Gine,Personality,"""Despite all my heinous provocations onNamek, Goku couldn't will himself to destroy me. He's a noble man of great moral clarity. So pure, he makes me want to vomit!""—Frieza's description of Goku's nature inDragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ Originally as an infantSaiyan, Goku was very timid, constantly crying for attention. Goku was then programmed with intense hostility to carry out his mission of eradicating all sentient life on Earth. When found byGrandpa Gohan, he was unruly, savage, and aggressive, wanting nothing to do with the elder. However, after the head injury that caused him to lose his instinctual aggression, Goku became well-known for the energetic, kindhearted, pure heart and caring personality traits he inherited from his motherGine. He was taught to be compassionate and respectful to others by Grandpa Gohan. He takes most situations in stride; he rarely lets things get him worked up; he quickly got over losing his tail each time. He is however not without fear. Goku is shown to be submissive to overbearing women likeBulmaandChi-Chi, even to the point ofMaster Roshijokingly declaring that for all his immense power, he is terrified of his wife. In theanime, he also has acrippling fear of needles. He is not beyond feeling sorrow, most noticeably seen from the loss of his grandfather. In theDragon Ball Supermanga, he is not above feeling shame, as he regrets his lack of maturity as a person despite all the teachers who have helped him and likewise wants to make his loved-ones proud of him. He also shows genuine concern for the well-being of those close to him. When Master Roshi seemingly died againstGanos, Goku frantically rushed to his aid, desperate to save his mentor and shed tears of joy when he managed to revive him. He is well-noted for his love of any food, having a sizeable appetite even by Saiyan standards,[4]which can be comical at times. When hypnotized while facing ""Jackie Chun"", Bulma told Goku dinner was ready, instantly waking him up.[34]Like most Saiyans, Goku loves combat and to challenge strong opponents. As such, Goku rarely shows nervousness or fear when fighting. While not arrogant in his abilities , Goku has a tendency to be too relaxed and recklessly challenge anyone he views as strong to a fight. Despite his fighting spirit, he is, at heart, a pacifist, as he often spares his enemies, trying to avoid hurting or even killing people if possible and never using more strength than necessary.[35][36]He also strongly believes that people can change for the better, as he sparedPiccolo, as well as Vegeta, in their respective fights, despite the former wanting to kill him and the latter killing most of Goku's allies. This, combined with his naturally gentle nature, can lead to him letting his guard down. Goku ispure of heart, possessing no negative feelings or thoughts. He is highly loyal to his friends and family and is extremely protective of them as a result. He loves them very much that he is willing to sacrifice himself to save others as he did againstRaditzandCell. He strongly believes in repaying debts, as he gave the then-evil Vegeta aSenzu Beanfor technically savingGohanandKrillinfrom theGinyu Force. He is a man of his word, committed to keeping his promise no matter what; two prime examples being the resurrection ofBoraand giving theOmni-Kinga friendeven more fun than himself. He has a very practical and carefree view of life, and his goals are very simple; he only seeks new adventures and challenges like testing his limits as a warrior. He has no interest in luxury or high-ranking positions, as he rejectedKami's offer to becomeGuardianofEarthand, likewise,Whis' offer to become the nextUniverse 7th'sGod of Destruction, though the latter was mainly due to his morality making him unsuitable for it. At the same time, he shows such unwavering will and tenacity to succeed, always determined to never give up against any adversity.[36] Goku has been noted several times to have a special effect on people. His genuine compassion for others and love of life in its most simple nature is capable of inspiring them to change somewhat for the better, even causing several of his enemies to become his allies. He convinced the amoral and self-absorbed God of DestructionBeerusthat Earth was worth keeping around. He made the reserved assassinHitsmile in genuine happiness, viewing Goku as an equal. He piqued the interest and became a friend of Grand Zeno, the most powerful being in themultiverse, due to his similar childlike, innocent personality. He made the immensely independentJirenacknowledge Goku's view of companionship and sought to learn from Goku's example. He even made the spiteful and sadistically greedyFriezacome to truly respect Goku, despite his long-standing hatred of the Saiyan after their brief alliance. His mindful generosity and helpfulness earnedBroly'strust, as Goku knows that the latter was forced to become his enemy, which Broly genuinely accepted as not only as a fellow Saiyan, but also his mentor for controlling his power. His passion to help people even inspiredMerus, aGuide Angel, to willingly violate Angel Law and directly engage against evil with his true divine powers, knowing the penalty of it. He has shown such innocence since childhood, mainly because of spending most of his childhood onMount Paozuin isolation, apart from the first few years of his life with his grandfather and spending his adolescence traveling the world to sharpen his combat skills. This lack of social experience and proper education growing up left him rather ignorant in many things outside of battle and had little development in emotional maturity. During his childhood, he originally had difficulty telling the difference between a male and a female without physically touching them, which often got him in trouble.[37] His lack of emotional maturity has also left him somewhat naïve, which often makes many incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid. His direct and carefree approach, combined with often taking things to face-value, can lead to Goku being rather blunt as he expresses himself. Despite this, Goku is remarkably effective at applying himself once properly motivated, able to quickly comprehend the situation and likewise learn the basics of anything presented to him, if not master it. When taking a firsthand experience, Goku is shown to be incredibly perceptive and intuitive, quickly able to analyze the situation and formulate an effective countermeasure. Very methodical and tactical in his approach, he immediately saw through the limits ofhighergradesofSuper Saiyaneven without having tested them in battle and chose to insteadrefinehis normal Super Saiyan form, impressing even his rival Vegeta at the crafty and innovative idea. He has a remarkable intuition to see the good in others in spite of their actions, though his compassion and willingness to forgive can have often been criticized as excessive even to a fault and has led to harm and death to those he cares about in extreme occasions. At the same time, for all his morally driven nature, Goku can show animosity towards those he believes have earned it, such asMercenary Taoand Frieza for killing Bora and Krillin respectively, a trait he seemed to inherit from his fatherBardock. Overall, Goku only kills his enemies when he feels it is necessary or if they are beyond redemption. While viewed by many as a very honorable man of heroic nature, he openly never actually considers himself a savior, but rather simply refuses to let innocent people or animals get hurt, as his adoptive grandfather taught him. He openly prefers to reform enemies on the grounds that it will be more exciting to clash with them in the future that way. Ultimately, this is one of his greatest drives in life, constantly pushing him beyond his limits. Whenever his friends are threatened or harmed, Goku abandons nearly all mercy for the foe, as the mortal-wound to Piccolo and the loss of his best friend Krillin against Frieza allowed Goku to unleash Super Saiyan on the tyrant. This is also seen when Jiren tried to kill all of Goku's friends, Gokufiercely attackedhim with rage. However, his philosophy of turning enemies into allies has sometimes clouded Goku's discernment in recognizing that certain opponents of his are unable to change or have any change in his way of thinking, best exemplified by his final confrontation withMoro, where his attempts to try to make the warlock repent for his atrocities after dominating him not only allowed him to strengthen himself further and put the entiregalaxyat risk after the latter merged with Earth, which made Goku visibly desperate for realizing that his complacency ended up putting everything to lose. Another problem stemming from his lack of proper education, Goku had little understanding of adult responsibilities. As a result, he spent most of his marriage without a job, instead of being supported by his prize-winnings from theWorld Martial Arts Tournamentsand theOx-King's wealth. This limited education also was seen from his struggle in the written test for theTournament of Destroyers. Overall, both his children have shown a better understanding of general matters as Chi-Chi ensured that Gohan andGotenhad a well-educated background. While Chi-Chi later made Goku take up a job as a farmer, Goku is regularly shown with little interest in it, often looking for excuses to get out of work to train instead. This mostly stems from his Saiyan nature, instinctively desiring combative challenges. Goku has little modesty and is not at all concerned about public nudity . His simple nature rarely exhibits lustful feelings and thus little interest in women . As a result, seduction tactics have no effect on him. While he is not normally reckless, he occasionally makes decisions without properly thinking them through, such as when he went to discuss theTournament of Powerwith the Omni-Kings despite Beerus warning him of the potential consequences of meeting with the amoral supreme rulers. While technically considerate in nature and never intentionally rude, Goku tends to not show proper respect to people of high authority; the most notable example being his casual interactions with the Omni-Kings and theGrand Minister, much to the shock and disgust of numerous Gods and Kais. Goku can be insensitive at times, as shown by his willingness to promiseOld Kainaked photos of Bulma, without consideration for either Bulma or her husband Vegeta . He enjoys meeting new people and learning about/from them. Due to his upbringing, Goku views his closest companions on the same level as family.[38]He is rarely seen romantic or intimate with Chi-Chi and mainly married her because he promised, although once learning marriage means living with someone forever, openly liked the idea with Chi-Chi. He has openly stated that he loves Chi-Chi and even cited her feistiness and passion as traits endearing to him. He will often leave his family for long periods, and though normally for noble reasons, such as maintaining his strength for their safety and the protection of the world, Goku does not realize its negative effect on his family and friends. Despite this, he consistently expresses his appreciation for his family, as after completing his training in theHyperbolic Time Chamberto faceCell, he chose to spend the remaining time with his family rather than training more. Goku desires for his children to follow in his footsteps as a fighter, but he is generally accepting of their choices in lifestyle so long as they are happy and healthy. Overall, his love for his family has been a constant boost to his performance in battle. Also, Goku was very happy to learn he was going to be a grandfather, to which he later enjoyed taking care of his baby granddaughterPanand grew very concerned when she disappeared. AgainstGoku Black, when learning that the rogue god murdered his family in spite of their initial encounter, despite it only happening in the original timeline, Goku'srighteous ragelet him pummel Black andFuture Zamasusimultaneously. Goku's love for his adoptive grandfather has constantly been the most emotional and influential aspect of his life, even long after the old man's death, and as shown by Goku's reaction to each time they met again in Gohan's afterlife. Even after learning, they were not blood-related or even the same race, Goku still considers the old man his family, as shown by his great sorrow and shame when realizing that he killed the kind man as aGreat Ape, apologizing deeply to him and hoping for forgiveness when next they meet. Goku's bond towards his grandfather made him cherish thePower Poleand the4-Star Dragon Ballthat he left his grandson behind as the only material objects of real worth to him. As a child, he even came to believe that the Dragon Ball housed the old man's spirit as he would speak it often, possibly as a coping mechanism to deal with his loss of his only known family. Goku was happy to meet all who were close to his grandfather and even delighted when his firstborn son reacted positively to being named after the elder. Contrary to popular belief, Goku loves his family, supporting their goals as well as sacrificing himself twice to save Gohan and fighting off Future Zamasu when he found outChi-ChiandGotenhad been killed by Goku Black. While considering himself an Earthling more than Saiyan, in battle, he tends to think more like a typical Universe 7 Saiyan. Once a fight begins, he desires to see it through to the end to truly determine who is the winner. Even while battling Frieza on the self-destructingPlanet Namek, he chose to finish his fight with Frieza even when offered the chance to escape through theNamekian Dragon Balls, believing that Frieza had to be defeated by his hand rather than random chance. He is also dissatisfied when foes do not use their full might. While valuing his friends' loyalty and willingness to accept help when the need comes, he prefers to face his challenges solo, determined to prove his might against the given foe. He openly showed dislike at originally acquiringSuper Saiyan Godthrough the aid of others rather than by his own merit. At the same time, he admits that the true growth of his being came from the support and connection he gained from others. His warrior mentality can be reckless at times. Against Cell, Goku chose to focus the majority of his efforts training Gohan in the goal of unlocking his son's dormant capacities to defeat Cell, forgetting that Gohan was even gentler than him. Likewise, for an unrestricted fight against Hit, Goku willingly risked his life by hiring Hit to kill him to fight him at his best. Goku is also willing to recruit help from his greatest of enemies like Frieza as he needed a strong tenth ally for the Tournament of Power though he himself acknowledged that it was a risky move and Vegeta noted that Goku wouldn't have done it under normal circumstances as the universes were at stake. At the same time, however, this ambition for the new generations stems from his humble concern that his friends and family have become too dependent on his might. He rationalizes his willingness to put the children in the spotlight of battle due to the fact that he will not always be around to help. He believes that the new generation needs to become stronger in order to protect the Earth from future threats. However, he is not without a personal goal behind it. Realizing the potential might of people like Gohan andUub, he is excited by the idea of facing such might once realized. At the same time, Goku tries to keep people away from the battlefield if he feels it will be too dangerous for them as he during the battle against the resurrected Frieza, Goku ordering Goten andTrunksto leave the battlefield to avoid the tyrant's brutality with Vegeta and Bulma agreeing. Grandpa Gohan and the pre-head injury Kakarot/Goku inDragon Ball Minus InDragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child, the three-year-old Kakarot is sent to Earth by his parents due to Bardock's keen intuition, suspecting that Frieza is planning to destroy the Saiyans due to his recent orders to return to Planet Vegeta and his men asking about legends regarding the Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan God. Upon reaching Earth, Kakarot encounters the Elder Gohan who after fighting with the child off panel brings him home where the Elder Gohan is able to placate the boy with food. The young Kakarot can be seen standing upon the table in Grandpa Gohan's House eating food with Grandpa Gohan commenting on his lack of manners as he refuses to sit in a nearby chair as he eats, before deciding to name the boy Son Goku . During theGranolah the Survivor Saga, Goku finally learns about his father Bardock thanks toMonaitorevealing how the low class Saiyan savedGranolahand Monaito during theCerealiangenocide and attempted to save Granolah's motherMuezlithough she was unfortunately murdered by theHeeterElec. Vegeta confirms Bardock is the name of Goku's biological father and after hearing the story notes that from his perspective, Goku seemed to have inherited his soft heartedness from his parents, given it was Bardock's love for his wife and youngest son that caused him to rescue Granolah and his mother instead of exterminating them like he was supposed to as aSaiyan Armysoldier. It is also revealed that Bardock fought and defeated the HeeterGasin hisInner Nature Unleashedwhich he managed to defeat. Gas himself also lamented that Goku lacks his father's grit and determination which Gas apparently respected. ""Mydad?! M-My dad is training you? What's he like? Is he nice? Is he...is he mean? I've never met my dad before, so I was really surprised when you told me he's training you! Maybe I should go meet him... Ooh, I should bringGohan!""— Goku toFuture WarriorinDragon Ball Xenoverse 2 Goku had very little knowledge of his biological family since he was too young to remember his parents and have never learned the good traits of them. His opinion on his Saiyan heritage kept varying through the course ofDragon Ball Z. Furthermore, when Goku first discovered his Saiyan heritage, he rejected it out of horror and disgust at being from a race of vicious killers, though he started to embrace his heritage after Vegeta's speech against Frieza on Namek had inspired him to avenge the loss of all those killed by Frieza, including his Saiyan race. After his first time transforming into a Super Saiyan, Goku seemed to have ultimately embraced his Saiyan heritage, while proclaiming himself to be the ""Super Saiyan of legend"" from the ancient Saiyan myths in order to frighten Frieza. Despite this, Goku has preferred to go by hisEarthlingname, although he has made Vegeta an exception because he knew that Vegeta will never change his mind on that, and also because the two are Saiyans like him. ByBroly, Goku has embraced his Saiyan heritage enough that he was willing to tellBrolyhis Saiyan name and requested that Broly refer to him as it. During the Granolah the Survivor Saga, upon learning about the noble side of his father, Goku became noticeably more intrigued to hear about him. Upon hearing a recording of Bardock's voice, Goku began to remember more about his parents and how they loved him so much to risk their lives to save him. InXenoverse 2, despite his extreme hatred for his evil brother, he showed an interest in learning more about his parents. When learning that theFuture Warrioris training under his father, Goku showed an interest in meeting him, even bringing his family. Goku's most unique relationship is with the Saiyan prince Vegeta. Their rivalry is mostly one-sided as Goku is generally friendly towards Vegeta and recognizes his abilities as a fighter, although Goku does get competitive with Vegeta as seen from learning that Vegeta left without him to train under Whis. While Goku and Vegeta have trouble working together, due to their conflicting personalities and Vegeta's continued desire to best Goku, they both respect and motivate each other to grow stronger, ultimately becoming close and loyal friends outside their competitive nature. Also, Goku is not above teasing him and tends to admonish Vegeta's brutality towards enemies, as shown when he criticizes Vegeta for killing the Ginyu Force while they're incapacitated and defenseless. InDragon Ball Z: Kakarot, during the wait for theCell Gamesafter finding out Gohan is staying over atCapsule Corporationafter helping the repairedAndroid 16, Chi-Chi notes that since Bulma is loaded, she bets he is enjoying quite the spread of food and asks Goku if he's jealous. Goku's response is that while he loves good grub, to him nothing tastes as good as her home cooked meals, causing Chi-Chi to feel both flattered and slightly embarrassed. This shows that he does indeed appreciate all the work she puts in cooking his meals."

Who is the eldest son of King Vegeta?,Trunksand Bulla,Students,"Vegeta, more specificallyVegeta IV,[1]recognized asPrince Vegeta, is the prince of thefallenSaiyanrace and the husband ofBulma, the father ofTrunksandBulla, the eldest son ofKing Vegeta, as well as one of the main characters of theDragon Ballseries. Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer,[12]but later abandoned his position in theFrieza Forcefor a peaceful life onEarth. He would repeatedly fight alongsideUniverse 7'smost powerful warriorsin order to protect Earth and his family, as well as to surpassGokuin power.[13] Vegeta's strong character development has received high praise and is regarded as the biggest in the series. He initially debuted as the main antagonist of theVegeta Sagabut progressed into a more anti-heroic tritagonist role for the rest ofDragon Ball Z. Since theMajin Buu Sagaand going intoDragon Ball Super, Vegeta has been the main deuteragonist/secondary protagonist behind Goku."
What color is Vegeta's hair?,black,Appearance,"Goku and Vegeta's height difference. Vegeta is a well-built man of below-average stature, standing at 164 centimeters tall. His hair is black and spikes upwards with a prominentwidow's peak. Like mostSaiyans, he possesses defined eyes with a consistently stern look to them. Like otherUniverse 7Saiyans, he was born with a prehensile, brown-furredtail, until it was permanently cut off byYajirobe. Over the course of the series, Vegeta's physical appearance changes. While originally appearing very short and lean, especially compared to his massive partner,Nappa, he later seems to be somewhat taller and noticeably more muscular. His hair and forehead appear to be shorter and his facial features, which are perpetually in a scowl , also look more distinct and sharply defined as the series progresses, making him look much older in later sagas compared to what he looked like in his debut. A major characteristic of Vegeta's is the fact that he is one of the only Saiyans who have continued to don the traditionalSaiyan armorin combat. This armor became more and more minimalistic over the years, mirroring Vegeta's development from a cold-blooded conqueror to a defender of Earth. During most of Vegeta's adult life working under theFrieza Force, as well as his appearance in theSaiyan Saga, he wore white armor with yellow plates that has thin black lines over the stomach and lower back, plus rounded shoulder, hip, and crotch guards, that also possessed yellow plates with thin black lines. Underneath his armor, he also wore a blue jumpsuit, white gloves, and white boots. He would often wrap histailaround his armor in a belt-like fashion, and usually wore a redscouter over his left eye. After the Saiyan Saga and during theNamek Saga, he wore a similar outfit to what he wore previously, but without hip or crotch guards. While wearing this outfit, he also no longer possessed his Saiyan tail, due to having it permanently cut byYajirobeduring his battle against theDragon TeamonEarthin the Saiyan Saga. He briefly wore another scouter, until deeming it unnecessary and destroying it. When his armor and bodysuit were damaged in his battle againstRecoome, he replaced his outfit with an older model design, where he wears a navy-blue crew neck bodysuit underneath a white armor with thin lined brown stomach and lower back plates, but with simple white shoulder straps instead of full shoulder guards. He also wore a new pair of his white gloves and boots from his previous ones, after also being damaged. He collectively wore this outfit during theCaptain GinyuandFrieza Sagasrespectively. In theTrunks Saga, he wore a loose-fitting pink short sleeved button-up shirt with the sign ""Bad Man"" at the back, a white tank top, yellow pants and green shoes with a brown trim. During theAndroids/Cell Saga, he wore a similar outfit to what he wore in the Namek Saga, but wore an updated version of his armor and bodysuit, where his armor now has yellow shoulder straps instead of shoulder guards, and the armor plates taking on rectangular like shapes instead of semi-ovular ones, meanwhile, his bodysuit now extends to cover the lower half of his neck. From thePerfect Cell Sagaand onwards, Vegeta now regularly wears an updated version of his white boots, where it has yellow striped tips. During theBuu Saga, to be allowed to fight in theWorld Martial Arts Tournament, Vegeta sported a sleeveless dark blue tank top tucked into matching sweatpants along with white gloves and boots. He later wore a similar outfit inDragon Ball Super: BrolyandSuper Herobut with the color being more of a dark teal blue, and his boots being rounder and having gray soles at the bottom. During his early cameo, debut, and filler appearances in theDragon Ball Zanime, Vegeta originally appeared with a totally different color scheme from his usual one, being depicted with reddish-brown hair, a light green and orange armor with guard plates, a navy blue jumpsuit, orange gloves and dark brown boots with orange uppers. This occurred only in the anime, as at the time Vegeta was introduced in the anime, theDragon Ballmanga had not yet officially released a full colored Vegeta for the animators to take reference on when adapting Vegeta into the anime, soToei Animationguessed his colors. It's not until the anime's depiction of Vegeta in his first arrival on Earth, that his color scheme completely changes to become more consistent to his traditional look, once the manga eventually revealed his actual color scheme. This color scheme also appears as an alternate color for his Battle Armor in various video games. In his initial design as a child inBardock - The Father of Goku, Vegeta was depicted with bangs, but still maintained his traditional spiky hairstyle. He wore white and yellow RIT modeled Battle Armor with a red cape and the Saiyan Royal family crest over the left breast, while also wearing a dark blue sleeveless tanktop and matching sweatpants underneath the armor, and also wearing white gloves and white boots. During flashbacks of him as a child inDragon Ball ZandDragon Ball Super, Vegeta was constantly shown in this design. However, in his depiction as a child in theDragon Ball Minusmanga chapter, as well asBroly, which adapted parts of theDragon Ball Minusmanga chapter, Vegeta in his childhood is instead seen with his traditional hairstyle that has a widow's peak, instead of bangs. This is to keep it consistent with his prior statement in the Perfect Cell Saga that ""a pure-blooded Saiyans hair does not change from the day they are born"", as Toriyama had established this concept after the release of theBardock - The Father of Gokuspecial, which depicted Vegeta as a child with spiky hair and bangs, rather than his usual spiky hairstyle with a widow's peak. Also in this design, he wears a similar armor to the one he wore in his original design as a child, but with the armor being black instead of white which lacks the Saiyan Royal family crest, having a full-sleeved blue jumpsuit, and his boots appearing rounder, with yellow lined tips and gray soles. In a flashback of him as a child inBattle of Gods, Vegeta is shown with his widow's peak, but wears the same outfit he wore in his original design as a child inBardock - The Father of Goku, although in this depiction of him, his undersuit now extends to cover the lower half of his neck, unlike in the original design. In all designs of Vegeta as a child, Vegeta would often let his tail hang loose, instead of wrapping it, like he did in his adulthood. InDragon Ball GT, Vegeta swaps out his outfit in favor of clothing more characteristic to an Earthling, wearing a dark blue collared leather vest, a dark red tank top, dark blue leather pants, a lavender belt with a gold buckle, lavender fingerless gloves, and lavender boots with a yellow toe cap and heel and a gold ring around the ankle. He also cropped his hair, which still spikes upward, and grew a mustache . InDragon Ball Super, Vegeta returns to wearing the same outfit he wore in the Androids/Cell Sagas, during theGod of Destruction Beerus Saga. This becomes his most regularly worn outfit throughout most ofSuper. During the early part of his training underWhis, Vegeta wore a new outfit made by Bulma, which changes to have a grey jumpsuit with lines down the middle of the top half that split off at the waist, a sleeker version of his usual white and yellow armor with flatter shoulder straps, along with white gloves and boots with a few outlines. Whis also placed his insignia on the left side of the armor's chest without Vegeta noticing when they were training. Vegeta also donned this outfit during theGolden FriezaandUniverse 6 Sagas. After the Universe 6 Saga, Vegeta again returns to wearing the same outfit he wore in the Androids/Cell Saga. InBroly, Vegeta switches to a slight variation of his regular outfit, with a darker blue jumpsuit, light gray panels on his armor instead of white, and more rounded boots with gray soles. To compensate for theIce Continent's cold weather, Vegeta wears a light green winter jacket, on top of his outfit, that has a high turtleneck, a long white line on each sleeve of the jacket, and a bold violet ""SAB"" sign in the left chest of the jacket. In the briefDragon Ball Supermanga recap version of theBrolyevents, Vegeta wears his regular outfit. In theGalactic Patrol Prisoner Saga, while working as a temporary member of theGalactic Patrol, Vegeta receives the Galactic Patrol emblem in the left chest plate of his armor, while donning his regularly worn outfit. He also wears the traditionalYardratoutfit while training onPlanet Yardrat. Under Beerus' tutelage andEnergy of Destructiontraining in theGranolah the Survivor Saga, Vegeta returns to his familiar look and wears a golden earpiece on his left ear, just like the Destroyer, as a symbol that he can use Energy of Destruction. InSuper Dragon Ball Heroes, when he appears in thePrison Planet Saga, Vegeta is back to wearing the outfit he wore duringResurrection ‘F’and theUniverse 6 Saga, but with the armor having a Capsule Corp logo in place of Whis' symbol. The armor also has small white hip guards and no lines going across the stomach plate. In the Big Bang Mission, his bodysuit changes to bright blue."
How does Vegeta feel about Frieza?,his race to be the most powerful in theuniverse,Personality,"""There's no planet to protect. No people to save. Just me, immersed in battle. My happy place.Just the thing to get a battle-crazedSaiyan's blood pumping.""— Vegeta in ""Vegeta Vs. Granolah"" Vegeta is arrogant throughout the series and becomes bitter due to the abuse hisracesuffered at the hands ofFrieza, as well as his injured pride due to repeatedly falling short compared to another Saiyan. Following the destruction of his homeworldPlanet Vegeta, his hatred toward Frieza grows. His royalty seems to have bestowed upon him an inflated sense of superiority, holding himself above nearly everyone he encounters. He is immensely proud of his Saiyan heritage and believes his race to be the most powerful in theuniverse. Despite this, even as an antagonist, he did not act as an ordinary Saiyan, being even crueler and prideful thanks to Frieza's influence. His determination to be the strongest remained ever-present even after his change of heart, remaining obsessed with the goal of surpassing Goku, as well as proving that he is stronger than any mortal, such as when he began to pit himself againstJiren,Universe 11's strongest warrior, in order to prove this point, becoming more determined each time Jiren left him in the dust, even telling him that his arrogance was what defined him. As the prince of a demolished Planet Vegeta, Vegeta is initially introduced as an unrepentant villain. Judging from his evil intentions before joining theZ Fighters, Vegeta has been consistently characterized as extremely arrogant, vengeful, and at times, sadistic. Many of Vegeta's early heroic acts are because of self-interest or revenge, although he later settles down and mellows out, adjusting to Earth as his home, raisinga familywithBulma. Having been born into the upper tier of Saiyan society, Vegeta was fixated on achieving the legendary status ofSuper Saiyanand becoming the most powerful warrior in the universe. Vegeta is more of a tactical fighter who often rushes in the brawl without hesitation. However, his rage or arrogance often causes him to underestimate his opponent and usually leads to his eventual defeat and sometimes death. His royal blood and intense fighting style have both benefited and harmed him in many battles. Vegeta has also been shown to be one of the more intelligent characters of the series, as well as one of the most serious, rarely exhibiting humor. When he does so, his humor is often very dry and far darker than his fellow Z Fighters. However, he does delight in mocking his enemies, as demonstrated when he offers to reconstructAndroid 18into a ""toaster"" or a ""washing machine"" . He also shows his bleak sense of humor towards Goku when he was about to battle him in theWorld Martial Arts Tournament. Aside from his bleaker sense of humor, he has also at times engaged in more sarcastic humor when gloating. A notable example of this was when fightingSemi-Perfect Cell. When Cell demanded to know how Vegeta was as strong as he was, Vegeta flippantly stated that he got that strong by ""doing lots of push-ups and sit-ups, and [drinking] plenty of juice"", as well as callingKid Buua ""gifted speaker"" when the latter barely responded at all just before the latter destroyed the Earth. Normally, his massive ego and arrogance overshadow his positive qualities. Despite his personality flaws, Vegeta is capable of respecting individuals, although he never outright states it often showing his respect nonverbally. By theMajin Buu Saga, it is heavily implied that he andPiccolowere on civil terms and seemed to have mutual respect for one another. He also expressed some grief overGohan's fate at the hands ofBuuhimself. Outside of these two instances, his relationship with the rest of the Dragon Team seemed cool at best. Initially, Vegeta was extremely aggressive and cold-blooded. Since his childhood, Vegeta had proven himself to be a ruthless killer, merciless like most Saiyans. During theNamek Saga, however, he began to exhibit changes; rather than killingKrillinor Gohan as he promised in theprevious saga, he instead forges an alliance with them. Throughout the first half of theFrieza Saga, whomever he defeated, he killed without mercy. His first sign of mercy was sparing Krillin and Bulma's lives in exchange for theNamekian Dragon Ballthey were carrying when he could have easily killed them and taken it. Another sign of mercy came when he encounters Gohan a short time later and knees him in the stomach instead of killing him, and again when he letNamekian FrogCaptain Ginyulive, taking delight at the notion of Ginyu's being stuck in the frog's body as punishment enough and not wanting to get frog guts all over his boots. After his defeat at the hands of Frieza, Vegeta tearfully explains to Goku that Frieza forced him to be ruthless and that he never had the chance to be anything else . He used to have egocentric, condescending views towards races of what he believed inferior or not of a warrior class or whatever he had little use for, considered physical and emotional attachments to be meaningless, and admittedly had little care or use for children, though he would at times acknowledge Gohan's impressive power during the boy's childhood. However, all these changes when he falls in love with Bulma and she bears him two half-Saiyan children. After settling onEarth, Vegeta softened up and began to exhibit compassion for his family. As a result of his love for Bulma and the birth of his children, Vegeta started to feel content settling down with a loving family while being a competitive warrior. However, Vegeta secretly felt ashamed for sacrificing his goal of becoming the strongest warrior in the universe for the sake of his family and came to believe it was his attachment to them and the planet that rendered him weak compared to Goku, though he kept those thoughts hidden for a time. On a similar note, largely because of his more cold-blooded and aggression, he initially had very little interest in avenging his race even after being made aware of rumors of Frieza havingblown up their planet, even going as far as to say they deserved it due to being too weak, which notably shockedNappaandRaditzwhen he admitted it. Even after receiving confirmation viaDodoriaabout Frieza's involvement in the genocide, his main motivation in avenging himself against Frieza afterward was less the Saiyan genocide itself and more being placed under forced servitude by Frieza for most of his life as a result. He seemed to have changed his tune later in life, as when confronting a revived Frieza, he makes clear that Frieza's genocide against his race is a major factor in why he refuses to rejoin him, and notably proceeded to attackBeerusin a rage after the latter admitted his role in causing the genocide to happen in the first place. It was not until the Majin Buu Saga that Vegeta began to act upon his concealed feelings, first sparked by hearing of Goku's temporary return to the living world. His obsession with overtaking and defeating Goku was once again ignited, but the repeated setbacks during the World Tournament byShinandBabidi's conflict made him irritated that his fight was being unceremoniously postponed. In addition, upon witnessing Goku'sSuper Saiyan 2during his fight againstYakon, Vegeta's hopes were further dashed as he realized how useless his own tireless training was. Desperation eventually consumes him to the point where he willingly allows Babidi totransformhim into aMajin, claiming it is a return of his old ""evil"" self, though this was a desperate, failed ploy to restore his former wickedness, believing it to have been the source of his true power. Goku believes Vegeta is bluffing, and correctly so; Vegeta demonstrates his prevailing softness in huggingTrunksfor the first time and telling him that he is proud to be his father, before performing a sacrificialFinal Explosionagainst Majin Buu. It is when his family falls victim to Majin Buu that Vegeta finally understands the pain of losing a loved one and fully grasps the harm he has caused to so many people, and he comes to regret his many transgressions. Since then, he has refrained from killing his opponents unless necessary and tries to be cautious of situations. ""But that's the thrill... don't you wanna see this powerhekeeps talking about?""— Vegeta tohis sonabout not lettingCellachieve his perfect form in ""The Last Defense"". Majin Vegeta From the beginning of the series to near the end, Vegeta is shown to be exceptionally vain and egotistical. A prime example of this is in his fight with Semi-Perfect Cell. Though he could have easily destroyed this weaker form of Cell, his arrogance bested him, and he purposely let CellabsorbAndroid 18 just to have a challenge in Cell through which to test his power. However, it should be noted that Cell used trickery and had knowledge of Saiyans due to their cells composing his structure. While fightingSuper Buu, as well as while fightingJanembaon a different occasion,[14]Vegeta vehemently opposedfusionwith Goku due to his pride, but Goku managed to persuade him. Later, Vegeta becomes more willing to fuse, going so far as to propose it himself in the battle againstOmega ShenroninDragon Ball GT. On several occasions, Vegeta conceitedly underestimates his opponents; in the cases of Perfect Cell and Kid Buu, Vegeta was fooled by their diminutive appearances, believing that they had only ""shrunk"", which is somewhat ironic, given his own short stature, yet large power. While Vegeta lives for battling powerful foes, in some instances he has been seen too afraid of opponents for their tremendous power; such as theLegendary Super SaiyanBroly,[15]theGod of DestructionBeerus ,[16]and Frieza. However, against Broly and Beerus he visibly had a change of heart, displayed his pride, and took to the fight. Despite his lust for fighting against powerful foes, Vegeta's arrogance has a flipside too. It's debatable that stronger the foe, the more aggressive Vegeta's fighting style becomes and vice versa. He often recklessly throws himself into the fray against foes that are drastically more powerful than he is, while he barely bothers to touch significantly weaker enemies likePui Puifor example. It could be argued that this attitude is a Saiyan trait instead of a personal quirk of his since there have been occasions when Goku shares this mentality, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent. Where Goku might see a potential learning experience in sparring with a weaker foe while keeping his own power level down to make it fair, it's likely that Vegeta refuses to dirty his hands with such menial tasks altogether. ""The boy doesn't mean any harm,Zarbon. He just hasn't learned how to control his passion. Give him the hardest assignment that you have, and Vegeta... do come back alive.""—Friezawhen responding the young Vegeta's plea for another combat assignment inDragon Ball Z: Bardock - The Father of Goku. Vegeta along with Raditz and Nappa, after conquering Planet Shikk Arguably, his most defining trait is his rivalry with Goku and his obsession to surpass him in power. InDragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn, he goes so far as to break down in tears over his inability to surpass Goku. However, this obsession has led him to save Goku's life on several occasions, insisting that only he will defeat Goku. When Goku sacrifices himself to save the Earth from being destroyed by Cell, Vegeta is devastated to the point that he vows never to fight again. Indeed, it would seem that Vegeta's most unique relationship is with his fellow Saiyan. Since their first battle, his opinion of Goku always being one step ahead of him, even though Goku is a lower class Saiyan, runs the gamut from contempt to rivalry, and later to respect and friendship. After the defeat of Kid Buu, he has a change of heart and his angry grudge against Goku becomes a friendly rivalry, though he will always get annoyed and even infuriated when someone openly refers to him as second-best to Goku, such asWhisandTop. Vegeta also maintains a hint of envy and fury whenever Goku reaches a new height, such asKaiō-Ken X10orUltra Instinct. He'll even jump at the chance to see Goku beaten by his hand even if the circumstances are technical, such as when he rooted for his copy-version to defeat Goku and opted to fightGoku Blackjust because he looked like Goku himself. Even so, Vegeta expressed his disdain for Black's shameless theft of his Saiyan brother's vessel, pummeling him as he reveals that Goku worked hard his whole life to achieve his strength and that regardless of his resemblance, he will never compare to the original. Despite his respect and friendship with Goku, he still gets highly annoyed with his immature tendencies and is shocked and even a bit disgusted by the fact that despite having a wife , Goku has no concept of romance and therefore finds it hard to believe that he is still married. Naturally, Goku almost always takes an optimistic opinion about Vegeta and openly admits to liking him but does occasionally criticize him for his brutality and not informing him when he is about to train. Possibly as a means of reminding him of his heritage despite his upbringing on Earth, Vegeta will nearly always refer to Goku by his birth name Kakarot, scarcely referring to him by his Earth name otherwise. In addition, particularly later on in the series, Vegeta will consistently agree with Goku during moments where he is mature, decisive, and perceptive, such as when he demanded that Trunks obey Goku's order to help resurrect Piccolo, when Goku pointed out the dangers ofFuture Zamasustill being around despite Whis' efforts, and especially when Goku expressed disdain at the idea of avoiding single combat during theTournament of Power, which Vegeta translates as meaning their blood won't allow them to act primarily as a unit. As a perhaps ultimate symbol of his friendship and trust in Goku, Vegeta gave him the rest of his energy and an impassioned speech that proved instrumental in allowing him tocomplete Ultra Instinctduring his battle with Jiren, earlier even mockingBelmodfor his stance concerning Goku's potential. In the manga,Pancalls him ""Uncle Vegeta"", even though they are not blood-related, signifying a meaningful bond between Vegeta's family and Goku's. Because of his arrogance, attitude and past wrongdoing, Vegeta gains much disdain from those around him, particularly Piccolo, Krillin, andTien, who continually admonished him for his brutality. However, after his plan to defeat Kid Buu and save the Earth is a success, Vegeta is recognized as one of the most reliable and strongest warriors known, and this allows him to not only reconcile with all the Z Fighters but to accept them as genuine comrades. Though they grew up apart, Vegeta does care about his younger brotherTarble, though he is highly disappointed with Tarble's extreme lack of fighting power despite the fact he comes from the powerful royal bloodline. After the Kid Buu Saga, Vegeta is much more relaxed. He is often seen smiling and cracking jokes, such as when he forced Trunks to enter the28th World Martial Arts Tournament, threatening to ""cut his allowance"" if he did not enter the competition. Often being more caring and kinder to his family, especially his daughter, Bulla, Vegeta admittedly has a kinder side, per his adjustment to Earthling life. His attitude towards fighting also changed; instead of training to surpass Goku, he is simply training because he is curious about what his own limits are. He does still retain his rivalry with Goku but following his revelation at the end of the Buu Saga, Vegeta only wants to beat Goku purely to test himself rather than prove superiority. Vegeta later developed a strong age crisis, such as ignoring a group of teenagers flirting with his daughter until they called him a ""geezer"" and whenDr. Myuucriticized Vegeta for continuing to voice his pride as a Saiyan prince despite how much he had aged. DuringDragon Ball Super, however, Vegeta has been shown to retain his arrogance and competitive mood, but he is more open to teamwork with the Z Fighters and is willing to help others in need. He has grown protective of the planet as he refers to it as his home and doesn't want to bear the burden of losing another home planet as he did with Planet Vegeta. He also develops strong morals, as he rejected Whis' offer to become the next Universe 7 God of Destruction and refused to rejoin forces with Frieza. Due to his initial lack of sentiment, Vegeta regarded familial bonds as inferior. Vegeta showed little to no interest in fatherhood when Trunks was born and viewed him as only Bulma's child because Vegeta never wanted to have children. But Vegeta gradually came to understand the gratitude of having a family and home to return to. He even cited being able to teach Trunks everything he knows as a priority to be a father. He will often decline to participate in family activities in favor of training, which he justifies on the grounds of enhancing his strength to protect the world. Vegeta is aware this affects his family, but he nevertheless strongly hints his appreciation for his family, as the Tournament of Power was being arranged, Vegeta initially turned down participating to witness the birth of his daughter. Vegeta also desires for Trunks to follow in his footsteps as a warrior but not so with Bulla, whom he dotes on, and gradually accepts if his children choose different paths as long as they are happy and safe. He is shown to be protective of his family, as it is shown Vegeta is unable to see his wife and children in pain or danger, which later serves as motivation for him to boost his capabilities in battle. Also, despite being nervous upon learning Bulma's second pregnancy, Vegeta was happy to learn he was having a daughter and enjoyed taking care of Bulla. However, he raised Trunks with a combination of respect and discipline, to where Trunks avoids misbehaving in his father's presence. Even more, he is willing to go to extreme methods to protect his family, including humiliation on his part for the sake of their well-being, and he is offended when he learns Goku would prefer training rather than spend time with his children. He is also proud of Future Trunks giving everything he had to protect his world fromZamasuand even protected Future Trunks from one of Fused Zamasu's attacks. His care for Future Trunks was further established inSuper Dragon Ball Heroeswhere seeing Future Trunks' life was in danger by the hand ofCumber, he chose to willingly put on thePotaraearring to fuse with Goku, something he was not willing to do before. InBojack Unbound, he also willingly went to confrontBojackafter seeing his son in danger from his men on TV and even made sure to bringFuture Trunks' swordalong to supply it to him, when earlier he was unwilling to participate in or ever watch theIntergalactic Tournamentdue to losing the will to fight as a result of Goku's death. On a similar note, after Piccolo accidentally reveals that the boy who defeated Frieza earlier was actually a future version of his then-newborn son, Vegeta privately expresses pride that his son would grow to become that strong, a stark contrast to the period between Frieza's death and the Androids' ambush, where he felt threatened by the boy's ability to become Super Saiyan. In theanime, Vegeta is shown to have a fear of worms, as when the smallroundwormsappear behind a larger one wheninside Buu, Vegeta bolts behind Goku.[17]On a similar note, he apparently wasn't fond of vulgar elements, which was best evidenced after the events of the Majin Buu Saga where he didn't join in laughter over Chi-Chi chasingGotenksafter Goku forced him out of an outdoor bath and coldly stated it was vulgar .[18]He apparently was also not fond of wearing apparently feminine clothing, as evidenced by his shocked and horrified reaction when he realized Bulma provided him with a pink shirt after he showered upon his return to Earth. In addition to his wife and children, it is implied that on some level Vegeta cared and looked up to hisfather, despite his claims to the contrary. His father was one of the greatest influences on young Vegeta, instilling in him his strong Saiyan pride as well as his early elitist views. Vegeta also tried to defend his father from Beerus showing that he indeed cared for him which is also supported by his assertion that he followed Frieza when he was younger cause Frieza had threatened his father. While Vegeta coldly seemed to care little for his father when Frieza mentioned killing him, it is likely he kept his true feelings towards his father to himself as such emotions were considered a sign of weakness among the Saiyans. In addition to his father, Vegeta has a positive relationship with his younger brother which is ironically in contrast to Goku and Raditz's relationship. Though Vegeta is ashamed of his brother's weakness like his father as he gets along well with him despite this though this may be due to Tarble looking up to Vegeta and even letting his brother believe he was responsible for defeating Frieza. It is unknown how they got along when they were younger as Vegeta had mellowed when it came to his family by the time, they inDragon Ball: The Return of Son Goku and Friends!though he apparently chose not to reveal he had a brother even to his own wife and children until Tarble appeared on Earth. It is also implied that his comrades were unaware of Tarble as Raditz never mentioned Tarble or any other Saiyan survivors indicating that he was unaware that Vegeta had a younger brother. However, it is possible that Vegeta may have secretly wished to protect the gentle Tarble from Frieza in addition to protecting the reputation of the Saiyan royal family. Vegeta tends to be hotheaded and quick-tempered during battles, especially ones not in his favor. According to Whis, the Saiyan Prince is too tense during fights and thinks too much before acting, putting a limit on his speed. Whis recommended that Vegeta needs to relax once in a while and not be so focused on training constantly since it is too intense for him to concentrate. During the beginning of theTournament of Destroyers, Vegeta shows a great interest in the Saiyans fromUniverse 6, askingCabbawhat the name of their homeworld is, and asking Cabba if he could learn more about the Saiyans of Universe 6, which is very uncanny of Vegeta as he rarely questions about the affairs of other people or planets. This shows that he has a deep-seeded passion and even curiosity about his race. Vegeta takes an instant interest in Cabba similar to a teacher-student relationship, going as far as to teach Cabba how to transform into Super Saiyan, expressing sadness when Cabba and Universe 6 are erased by the Zenos, and vowing to resurrect Cabba and his universe with theSuper Dragon Balls. Vegeta has often been shown to have a deep dislike for fighters who use unfair methods for a fight, which shows that he is someone who prefers to fight with dignity. An example of this was during the Tournament of Power, whenUniverse 2warriorPrumacted as a sniper and tried to eliminate Vegeta , the Saiyan Prince furiously insulted him, calling him a dishonorable coward and a shameless worm. He also shows contempt for those who abandon their own values and code as Top, who in Vegeta's eyes was only a loser who cannot even protect his own pride. He also viewsMorowith disgust, stating how he takes the power of others and does not give a fair fight and the reason he does this is because his true power is extremely weak. During theGalactic Patrol Prisoner Saga, Vegeta reflected on his last visit toPlanet Namek, expressed guilt over what he had done to theNamekians, and vowed to protect them andNew NamekfromMoroas a form of atonement.[19][20]Piccolo also notes on this sense of atonement from Vegeta, amazed by how much Vegeta has grown as a person and how he is now fighting for the planet in an attempt to make up for his past and wipe the slate clean by defeating Moro. Vegeta has also come to accept the sins of his past, stating that when he dies, he will surely go to Hell because he is a villain and has come to accept the consequences for his actions, but still fights for the planet in his attempt to make up for those actions, demonstrating his significant change of character. This change of character is also shown after Moro's invasion: while conversing with Beerus on his world, Vegeta shows deep shame in the Saiyans' past of bloodshed and domination, fully accepting their crimes while also admitting Frieza wasn't responsible for their crimes.[21]During theGranolah the Survivor Saga, after acquiring Ultra Ego and his training with Beerus, Vegeta noted that unlike the past, he could not throw away his morality to utilize the form to its full potential. This shows that Vegeta's morality, despite being more ruthless than Goku's, has developed to the point where he cannot return fully to the brutal and cold warrior he once was."

What does Gohan do when he is forced to fight?,protecthis familyand friends,Personality,"As a child, Gohan was a shy, studious, intellectual child who lacked a Saiyan's raw fighting spirit, so he had to utilize his incredible half-breed Saiyan potential and emotional reserves to protect those he loves. As an adult, he achieves his dream career of becoming a great scholar. Being only half-Saiyan, Gohan is unusual in his values and personality compared to most full-blooded Saiyans in regards to the fact that he does not derive much pleasure from combat. However, when he is forced to fight, he shows special interest in protectinghis familyand friends. Like his father, Gohan has a pure and gentle heart, as well as possessing the typical Saiyan appetite that will compel to eat anything.[2] While he claims he does not share the love of fighting Goku has, Gohan does indeed lovemartial artsand adventures. It is also clearly obvious that he enjoys his superhuman powers, especially when utilizing them as a superhero. However, he dislikes receiving the fame and attention that comes with it and prefers to keep a low profile, which is why he created the Great Saiyaman persona, in order to keep his identity a secret. This is even more evident when he didn't acknowledge Cell's defeat at his hands to the public after Mr. Satan falsely took credibility for it. During theZeno Expo, he admitted that his Saiyan half was getting excited from the challenge shown byTopof Universe 11, demonstrating that even though he despises senseless violence, he actually does enjoy fighting as a sport. It is possible that he prefers not to fight due to the many gruesome and painful battles he experienced in the past as a child, which may have led Gohan to have negative emotions associated with fighting. However, even though he is naturally smart, humble and kind, Gohan himself has been a victim of his own power in the past. Whenever Gohan gets a gigantic power boost, he becomes arrogant and cocky, essentially becoming drunk in his power, often acknowledging and even enjoying his superiority over his opponents, as he did when he first became a Super Saiyan 2 against Cell, and later in his life when he achieved his Ultimate form and fought Super Buu. This fatal flaw of his warrior-personality might be an actual side-effect of his Saiyan-heritage, since Saiyans such as Vegeta, or Nappa, have been known to act similarly when drunk in their own power while fighting. This has led him to the brink of defeat on several occasions and has later had to deal with the consequences of his actions, such as the death of his father at the hands of Cell, or Super Buu absorbing him and endangering the entire universe in the process. However, thanks to Piccolo, Gohan works on overcoming this flaw of his, to not let his own superior power blind him on the battlefield ever again. By the time of the battle with the resurgent Red Ribbon Army and Cell Max, Gohan was shown to have overcome this flaw to a degree: upon assuming his Beast form, despite the level of power it brought him, he showed no hesitation in taking down Cell Max. Besides concerning himself with his family , Gohan has a strong attachment with his mentor: his father's former arch-rival Piccolo. After the death of Goku, Piccolo chose to train Gohan as he sensed the boy's massive in-born potential, which would be harnessed to help defend the Earth from the attack of the Saiyans. At first, the relationship with Piccolo is a frightening one, but after just one year, Piccolo admits his change because of the friendship he develops with Gohan and even sacrifices himself to save the boy from Nappa. Gohan has even openly come to think of Piccolo as a surrogate uncle to him.Krillinalso has an influence on Gohan, as almost an uncle/nephew relationship, mainly because Krillin is Goku's closest friend. While Gohan does care about his mother, he is like his father in the way that they both have a fear of her temper to the point inDragon Ball Superhe informs his mother that Goku planned to leave to train under Whis, stating that he had to tell her for his own safety, though fortunately Chi-Chi surprisingly calmed down after Goku left with Whis. However, Gohan will defy his mother if it is important as he tells his mother off after she refuses to let him go to Namek to revive Piccolo using the Namekian Dragon Balls, due to feeling responsible for Piccolo's death at the hands of Nappa. After the battle with Cell, Gohan gives up martial arts to focus on his studies and only resumed his training at the behest of his little brother Goten. Although he acknowledged he had fallen out of practice and lacked the fighting expertise of his father and Vegeta, Gohan gave all that he had as he fought Majin Buu and was eager to kill Buu for murdering his family and friends. In the years to come, he continued to train on-and-off while having a career and being a family man. He marries Videl, with whom he fell in love despite her being Mr. Satan's daughter, and has a daughter named Pan. Gohan proves to be a loving husband and doting father who takes delight in lavishing his daughter with attention and affection. Unlike his father, Gohan demonstrates interest in girls such as Videl though he is generally shy when it comes to girls around his own age and is respectful more towards girls and women due to his mother's influence . However he can be at times just as oblivious as his father when it comes to romance as he is good natured personality as shown when he suggested Videl cut her hair for practical reasons though she assumed it was because he preferred girls with short hair and angrily told him off when she learned his true reasons as she herself was slowly developing a crush on him at the time and mistook his obliviousness as a sign that he wasn't interested, though she later followed his advice much to his utter confusion. However, he too slowly developed feelings for Videl after spending time with her and was deeply angered when she was brutalized by Spopovich to the point he rages caused him to involuntarily transform into aSuper Saiyancausing him to lose his bandana, while doing everything he could to restrain himself from interrupting the match. He was even determined to avenge her by defeating Spopovich in the tournament though this ultimately did not occur and Spopovich was killed by Babidi. He also hid his role in Cell's defeat from her out of respect for her and her father, though later came clean during the conflict with Majin Buu though she herself was actually relieved as she had always secretly questioned the validity of her father's claims and only made her feelings for Gohan stronger as she recognized he was truly an awesome guy as he was humble about his achievement and never sought to profit from his defeat of Cell as he could have easily refuted Mr. Satan's claims had he wanted to by simply defeating him in a show of power. Gohan angrily yelling at his father for suggesting Videl when trying to bribe Elder Kai to unlock Gohan's potential Gohan's feelings for her were so strong that during theFusion Sagahe angrily opposed his father suggestion of using her to bribe the perverted Old Kai to unlock his potential. In fact, his angry reaction to his father's questionable yet well-meaning suggestion is not unlike Chi-Chi's temper, indicating that he inherited his temper from her which due to his Saiyan genetics likely contributed to his berserker-like rage as a child. However, he is somewhat bashful about his feelings for Videl due to his shyness. InXenoverse 2, while working as an Instructor with Videl his oblivious personality is still present despite his feelings for her as he obliviously asks the Future Warrior to join them when Videl suggests they go to the movies unaware that she was subtly asking Gohan out on a date causing her to angrily uninvite him stating she and the warrior would go to the movies without him out of frustration . However he and Videl managed to bond and grow closer even fighting crime together as theSaiya Squadwith Videl even donning her own alter-ego Great Saiyawoman and developing a fondness for heroic posing despite finding it ridiculous at first, though inXenoverse 2it is implied that she reluctantly agreed to pose at Great Saiyaman's insistence and found that she actually enjoyed it which apparently increased their bond with one another. After his marriage to Videl, he became a devoted husband. He felt terrible when Videl was injured during Bulma's birthday due to his drunken overconfidence causing him to recklessly defect a bullet shot byMai, though fortunately neither Videl or the unborn Pan were seriously hurt and Dende was on hand to heal the injury. Videl later revealed she was pregnant much to Gohan and their family's joy, with Gohan excited at becoming a father. An equally devoted father, though due to his job and family life he neglected his training which left him unprepared for Frieza's revenge. In the anime, after witnessing the death of Piccolo, Videl and Pan at the hands of Frieza before it was undone by Whis'Temporal Do-Over, Gohan realizes that he must get much stronger in order to protect them. Because of this, he asks Piccolo to train him once again.[7]His devotion to protecting his new family helped him regain his strength and he even returned to fighting crime as Great Saiyaman. However while working as a stunt double forBarry Kahnfor the Great Saiyaman film after Mr. Satan got him the job , his identity as Great Saiyaman was discovered by pop idolCocoa Amaguri, after she overheard Gohan talking about it to Bulma, who blackmailed him to fly her around town and do a rehearsal with her though the rehearsal was something that Barry Kahn forced her to do as he planned to blackmail Gohan though Cocoa tried her best to avoid the planned set up by changing the location of the rehearsal as she had developed a crush on Gohan after recognizing how devoted he was to his wife and daughter, though she innocently kissed him on the lips to thank him for his kindness and words of encouragement, unaware that Barry Kahn had secretly followed them and took a picture though Barry's plan was thwarted by Videl seeing through his show of concern in an attempt to woo her after providing her with the photo as evidence that Gohan was unfaithful . After Barry was possessed byWatagash, he kidnapped Pan causing Gohan as Great Saiyaman to become Super Great Saiyaman and defeat the possessed Barry to protect his family from the possessed actor, managing to separate Barry from Watagash. During this confrontation, both Videl and Pan both had the faith Gohan would protect them showing they both know Gohan would do everything in his power to ensure their safety. By the time of theTournament of Power, Gohan has become considerably more powerful than before, however, despite reawakening his power, Piccolo points out his tendency to become arrogant and let his guard down could prove disastrous for Team Universe 7 during the tournament so he tries to discipline Gohan in order to break this dangerous habit. In the anime, after witnessing his son's newfound power, fighting instincts and keeping in mind his keen intellect, Goku makes the decision to step aside from the role of Team Captain and appoints Gohan as the Captain of Team Universe 7 after their fight, stating Gohan's power is similar to his own and his intelligence makes him ideal for the role. Ultimately, Gohan’s goal to grow stronger has taken a unique path compared to other Saiyans. While desiring to surpass his father, he wishes to do so by his own terms and methods, choosing to focus on empowering his natural and unamplified power rather than depend on any Super Saiyan transformations; in the manga, he views this as relying more on his individual nature than just his Saiyan aspect.[8]During the anime version of the tournament, Gohan proved to be a very capable leader coming up with numerous strategies on the spot to defeat troublesome opponents. Even Frieza, who detests all Saiyans, actually compliments Gohan's leadership skills, calling him a worthy leader. Gohan's work on insect studies InDragon Ball Super: Super Hero, it is revealed that Gohan has become extremely devoted to his scholarly work, spending multiple days alone in his room working on a project on ""Sai-ants"", much to the chagrin of Piccolo, who believes he should be acting more as a family man and keeping up with his training. InDragon Ball Online, it is shown that as a scholar Gohan became devoted to studying and researching the nature ofkiand begins researching the martial arts of the past, organizing them in his bookGroundbreaking ScienceinAge 804. The book became extremely popular and introduced the concept ofkito the general population of Earth sparking a renewed interest in the martial arts and fighting. One of the articles, ""Katchin Can Be Cut!"", had an immense influence on his brother and Trunks leading them to study swordsmanship which allowed them to develop their natural potential via intense training and as adults Goten and Trunks founded theKikoukenjutsu Sword School. The renewed interest in the martial arts also had to lead to the founding of theNew Turtle SchoolbyKrillinandNew Crane SchoolbyTien Shinhan. As Goku and Vegeta had left Earth to settle their rivalry inAge 801after Goku realized his death was imminent, it was left to the remaining Z Fighters Gohan, Goten, Pan, Trunks, Krillin, and Tien to defend the Earth after the remnants of the Frieza Force invaded Earth following the death of Gohan's father-in-law Mr. Satan whom theGuard Troopsthat lead the army assumed had defeated Frieza. Like he had in the past, Gohan resorted to using his old alter-ego Great Saiyaman to defend the Earth and managed to convince Pan, Goten, Trunks, Krillin, and Tien to disguise themselves with Saiyaman-like suits as well to hide their identities while combating the Frieza Force, however theirki-based fighting style became a hot topic and global interest inkiescalated. As a result, Gohan in his role as a scholar and Z Fighter ended up sparking a martial arts revolution on Earth and secretly continued to defend Earth with his family and friends as he had done for most of his life."

"Who was the main antagonist in the final saga of Dragon Ball, the Piccolo Jr. Saga?",Piccolo Jr.,Students,"Piccolo Jr., usually just calledPiccoloand also known asMa Junior, is aNamekianand also the final child andreincarnationofKing Piccolo, later becoming the reunification of theNameless Namekianafter fusing withKami, at which point he was once referred to asKamiccolobyGoku. According toGrand Elder Guru, Piccolo, along with Kami and King Piccolo, are part of theDragon Clan, who were the original creators of theDragon Balls. A wise and cunning warrior, he was the main antagonist in the final saga ofDragon Ball, thePiccolo Jr. Saga, and was thus a ruthless enemy of Goku. However, starting with the first saga ofDragon Ball Z, theRaditz Saga, he began to lose all villainous traits, and when he started training Goku's sonGohanduring theVegeta Sagawhich led to the two developing a strong bond, he became a permanent member of theDragon Teamand eventually one ofEarth's greatest heroes."
How many fingers does Piccolo have in the Dragon Ballmanga?,four,Appearance,"Piccolo with his manga colors Piccolo is a very tall and muscularNamekian. While greatly resembling hisfather/incarnation, he is noticeably shorter and somewhat thinner, though his father's extreme height appears to have been a personal choice on his part to give himself a further intimidating appearance as opposed to naturally occuring. He also has a more solid facial structure with less pronounced cheekbones, a rounder chin, and a straight nose. Piccolo only has four fingers with black nails in theDragon Ballmanga, but five fingers with white nails in the anime series and theDragon Ball Supermanga. He has several colored patches of skin with red borders and thin black lines going across them on his arms, legs, and stomach, which are pink in the anime and yellow in the manga . Piccolo Jr.'s outfit when he was a kid is very similar to the one King Piccolo is first seen wearing, with the same color scheme shown on theKanzenbanmanga covers. From the time he is a young adult onward, Piccolo wears a dark purplish-blue gi, pointy orange shoes and sky-blue obi . When not fighting seriously, Piccolo also wears a white turban with a dark purple blue top and a white cape along with it. The turban was initially depicted with two pointy dangling ends for his debut in in the manga plus in the next episode preview ofDragon BallEpisode 134, only to disappear from his design shortly thereafter. Like Goku, Piccolo generally wears and trains withWeighted clothing. The cape itself is not weighted, but there is weighted padding underneath; this is seen twice in the series: when his cape is damaged while fightingFriezain his second form, and when it is damaged byLord Slug's henchmen. As the series went on, Piccolo Jr.'s outfit became more his own and by the time he faced theAndroids. The outfit's neckline becomes more lowcut likeGoku's outfit, minus Goku's own undershirt. In the manga, many of the movies, and certainvideo games, Piccolo wears a red obi rather than a sky blue one. Even though Piccolo Jr. discards his old symbol, he uses it once in the series when he made his pupil Gohan a uniform after his previous outfit was torn in aGreat Apetransformation. In theanime, when both of them are forced by Goku's wifeChi-Chito go to driving school, Piccolo wears an old outfit of Goku's, which he despised wearing.[12] Piccolo's Red Ribbon Army soldier disguise inSuper Hero InSuper Hero, Piccolo's outfit is changed slightly. His gi is a slightly brighter shade of purple, the neckline is cut even lower than before, and he has a red obi, like the manga and other films. His shoes are olive brown, rounder at the tips, and have grays soles at the bottom. In order to infiltrate the Red Ribbon Army base, Piccolo dons the uniform of a Red Ribbon Army soldier that features the number 94 on the chest ."
What is the name of Piccolo's father?,Goku,Personality,"Throughout the franchise, regardless of Piccolo's allegiance, his general demeanor has always been stern, if not grumpy, with an indifferent attitude towards others. Piccolo rarely smiles and enjoys solitude. Piccolo is frequently seen meditating in quiet places and drinking thawed ice water in the north area.[5]However, he shows a noticeable cockiness when fighting. He can also be very confrontational toward people, showing very direct and honest opinions about a situation or an individual. Piccolo is known for his very precise and efficient methods in battle and likewise is shown to be very analytical and tactical in battle, able to see through his opponent's skills and weaknesses to devise effective strategies for victory. In theBaby Saga,Babyopenly acknowledged Piccolo as one of the most brilliant fighters in the galaxy. Originally, Piccolo inherited hisfather'sdesire for world domination and destroyingGoku. He was determined to prove his superiority and possessed many of the villainous properties of his father, such as a violent and destructive nature and a total disregard for anything besides victory. This was shown during his battle with Goku in the23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, where he shows almost no mercy for his opponent, breaking all of Goku's limbs while laughing sadistically, believing it was necessary after what Goku had done to his father. Despite all this, Piccolo was not without a measure of restraint and honor, as he for no reason saved a mother and daughter from debris during a storm.[13]He also letKrillinwalk away after submitting in the tournament. Piccolo has also shown traits of pragmatism, teaming up with his archrival Goku and later the rest of the Z Fighters when the threat of theSaiyansproves to be too much for him alone, citing the aliens' defeat as a shared goal. According to Goku, his overall evil nature became more of a stubborn and angry attitude than flat-out villainous. After his battle against Goku, Piccolo gradually began to develop for the better as the evil nature only dwelled through his desire to destroy Goku inherited from his father. Later, when he and Goku team up to battleRaditz, Piccolo began to show more respect during the battle, even commemorating Goku on his noble sacrifice despite still considering him an enemy and, during the battle againstNappa, praised the other Z Fighters' bravery and tactics. While training Goku's young son,Gohan, while originally only for to prepare for the coming Saiyans, Piccolo's heart and motives quickly begin to change as the boy takes his time to talk with Piccolo and have normal discussions that do not result in a violent outbreak, this stemming from Gohan agreeing on Goku's views of Piccolo now being more grumpy than truly evil. During the time he was training Gohan, bothMr. PopoandKaminoted the change in Piccolo's personality with Mr. Popo noting he was no longer the Demon King of old referencing his loss of Demon Clan status and Kami himself surmised that he had the same premonition of death that Kami himself had and that Piccolo wanted to leave behind some kind of legacy even if it was in the son of his sworn enemy. Around the start of Gohan's training Piccolo told Gohan that if he feels resentment towards him, then he should curse his own fate like Piccolo did, indicating Kami was right about Piccolo's motivation. During the battle with Nappa, Piccolo goes as far as tosacrifice his life to save Gohan, stating how his friendship and love had changed him forever. Piccolo has stated that Gohan was the first person to see him not as a monster and was proud to call him his friend. From then on, Piccolo became very protective of Gohan, proud in his growth as a man and seeing Gohan almost like a little brother, to which Gohan himself came to care for Piccolo as a dear uncle. This also truly cemented his change from evil to good and a true friend and team-mate for the Z Fighters. He also came to view Goku in a similar light as a dear friend and ally as after being teleported from the self-destructingPlanet Namekand learning of Goku's intentions, Piccolo noted he would have preferred to fight alongside the noble warrior to the end, showing his respect for the Earth's savior. Piccolo and the two Namekians who inhabit his body Despite having spent most of his life unaware of his origins as an alien rather than a demon and shocked to learn such, Piccolo came to appreciate learning this truth. To which, upon learning ofFrieza's genocidal attack on theNamekians, Piccolo was determined to fight Frieza and avenge his people, even whenKing Kaiwarned him of the danger Frieza's might possesses. AfterfusingwithNailand acquiring all his knowledge of Namekian culture, Piccolo felt whole as a person, now able to understand his roots. The greatest change in his character was when he made the choice to remerge with Kami so he could battle theandroids. Kami's willingness to do this showed how little evil was left in Piccolo, trusting that Piccolo would use the extra strength along with Kami's divine powers and centuries-worth of experience for good. Once reunited, all remaining traces of evil disappeared from Piccolo. Furthermore, after remerging with Kami, Piccolo also gained tremendous levels of care forthe Lookout, becoming extremely distraught upon seeing it destroyed duringGotenks' battle withSuper Buu, to the point of leaving him completely distracted from the ongoing battle and unaware of incoming attacks that could potentially kill him. While still having a stern demeanor for the most part, Piccolo showed genuine compassion for all living being beyond those he deemed a friend, as he tried to getCellto spare the man in Ginger Town. Furthermore, during theFusion Saga, when Super Buuexterminates the human race with a single attack, Piccolo drops to his knees, both in shame for suggesting Buu to kill more humans and horror, with Piccolo desperately hoping for redemption and vowing to bring them all back to life. Although he still has little to say unless it involves battle and does not seem to understand the concept of romance, referring to it as ""mushy stuff"", although this is understandable since Namekians lack romantic relations. Piccolo, both stressed and angry As Piccolo carries on in life, he becomes slightly more relaxed and joyful, which simultaneously made it easier to stress and annoy him. He would partake and enjoy various parties and social events, includingBulma's birthday and Gohan's wedding. Even more, inDragon Ball Super, Piccolo's kindness continued to show, displaying a gentler and nurturing side, helping in the raising ofPan, showing a very efficient job of it as he had a whole list set up on what to do for the baby and genuinely enjoyed it. His raising of Pan also shows his more joyful and silly side, playing Peek-a-Boo with Pan when no one was looking and revealing that he actually sings to Pan whenever she cried at night, though he takes pains to hide this. He has since taken it upon himself to teach her martial arts with the promise ofkiusage training once she proves herself ready. InDragon Ball GT, his compassion and selflessness were even willing to sacrifice his life permanently to make sure theBlack Star Dragon Ballsremained unusable. While encouraging Gohan to find his own path in life, he still firmly believes that Gohan must keep up his training to better protect that which he loves. To which, he proudly accepted Gohan's request to retraining him after the second battle against Frieza cost Piccolo his life again to save Gohan. During which, Piccolo retains his harsh and merciless training methods, all in the goal of restoring Gohan's fighting instinct and true power. Unlike most Namekians, Piccolo has a history of consuming solid food in addition to the Namekians normally liquid diet of water. As a child, he is seen catching and eating a fish. Even after it is revealed Namekians only require water to survive, Piccolo occasionally eats solid food. InDragon Ball Superhe can be seen occasionally with a plate of food during various social gathers implying Piccolo eats socially. However, his favorite food is water from theNorthern Mountainsindicating he still retains a normal Namekian diet in addition to eating solid food. InDragon Ball Super: Super Hero, whenVideloffers to bring him food as reward for picking upPanfrom kindergarten, Piccolo reminds her that he doesn't need to eat food to survive and can merely live off of water, suggesting that Piccolo ceased eating solid food entirely. InXenoverse, Piccolo is shown to have learned from his father's mistakes even usingMaster Mutaito's defeat of King Piccolo with theElectric Rice CookerandEvil Containment Waveas an analogy of why one must use whatever items or abilities one has at their disposal to win. This is further shown in the original manga/anime by Piccolo's development of theEvil Containment Wave Reflectiontechnique which he used to counter Kami's use of the Evil Containment Wave essentially removing the one threat his father had feared the most."

What is the Japanese version of Bulma's sex appeal?,tomboyish and girly,Personality,"Bulma's tantrums when stranded in the wild Bulma has a temperamental personality while being very tomboyish and girly at the same time. While known for her extreme intellect, Bulma is quite spoiled and vain, using her beauty as an excuse for doing and getting whatever she wants; this sort of behavior seemingly prevented her from being able to ride theFlying Nimbus. While in stressful conditions, she becomes frightened easily and gets angry toward everyone, including her allies. Bulma tends to have a great deal of concern over her hygiene, complaining when circumstances prevent her from taking abathor replenishing her beauty supplies, even when it is the least of her worries, such as when stranded in the wilderness. At times, her wanton outbursts have landed her and her friends in deeper trouble. Despite her temper, Bulma frequently displays friendliness and helpfulness towards others. She also tends to seek out excitement and adventure despite her haughtiness and sheltered upbringing. When calm, she tends to approach major situations rationally, often making crucial decisions on her own, and is very persistent in achieving her goals. As she gets more mature, Bulma focuses on becoming a great scientist and helps out by creating and fixing inventions that help theDragon Teamandher family. She is shown to be very witty, usually teasing her friends, a part of being chipper and easygoing. In the Japanese version, she even refers toGokuandKrillinby the Japanese suffix ""-kun,"" indicating she feels very close to them. An example of Bulma's attempts at using her sex appeal Bulma enjoys strawberries,[9]attractive boys and bubble baths. Though she shows a strong dislike towards perverted men, she would not hesitate from taking advantage of them; she has been known to use her sex appeal for self-gain on occasion and would herself become infatuated with men she'd just met based entirely on their looks. This happened even during times when she was datingYamcha, whom she claimed to intend to marry. Hypocritically, her infatuation would also sometimes cause her to flirt in a very crass manner, as demonstrated withGeneral Blue, having grabbed his arm and licked it while meowing like a cat. She also had zero tolerance towards Yamcha being approached by other women when she was still dating him; she broke up with him when she thought he was cheating on her withHasky, and again when she sawMaronattempting to flirt with him. She later lost interest in Yamcha due to his lack of commitment and showed greater commitment and maturity herself in her relationship withVegeta. Despite their rocky start and quarrelsome natures, Bulma has a unanimous relationship with Vegeta, which further improves after their marriage. Bulma tends to boss Vegeta around and often berates him for his rudeness, goading him into further argument, though they both seem to glean some bizarre fulfillment in their rapport, and she in particular takes pleasure in teasing him. Although they argue often and despite him being a former enemy, Bulma is very devoted to Vegeta and truly loves him, taking great pride in being his wife. After becoming a mother, Bulma is a loving one towards her children, though she doesn't hesitate to lay down the law whenTrunksmisbehaves. Bitter breakup and marriage to Vegeta notwithstanding, Bulma and Yamcha still care for each other as longtime friends, enough so that the former openly wept in the latter's arms at the news of Vegeta's death battlingBuu. By the time ofSuper, Bulma clearly still considers him an important part of her life, enough to have him at every one of their frequent parties and happily lets him hold babyBulla. One of Bulma's most interesting relationships is her friendship with Goku, having known him for the majority of his life and becoming his first and among closest friends. Initially, she expressed frustration and annoyance towards his lack of hygiene, manners, and knowledge of the world, and sought only to use him as protection whenever they encountered trouble while looking for theDragon Balls. Soon after however, Bulma came to warm up and care for Goku, their relationship being akin to that of an older sister and younger brother. As they grew up together into adulthood, Bulma showed great concern for him whenever he was in serious danger and would assist him whenever he needed it, despite never-abating irritation at his unrelenting immaturity. Bulma's faith and trust in Goku's abilities has shown to be absolute to the point where she often displays more confidence in him than Vegeta, such as in the battles with Majin Buu as well asGoku BlackandFuture Zamasu. Bulma's companionship with Goku also extends tohis family, being a good friend ofChi-Chi's and showing a great deal of warmth to their sonsGohanandGoten. Though she isn't a fighter, Bulma can be violent when angered and defend herself if need be. Several characters such as Krillin, Goku, Vegeta, and evenBeerushave shown fear at her violent temper. When it seemedFriezahad been destroyed by theLarge Spirit Bomb, Krillin freaked when he remembered they had left Bulma alone onNamekand even suggested that an angry Bulma is more terrifying than Frieza. Much later, Goku panicked when he realized he had forgotten it was Bulma's birthday and even suggested she might be more terrifying than Beerus. Also, Vegeta adamantly refused to go training with Goku during Bulma's pregnancy because he feared she would never forgive him, although it's more likely that he simply wanted to be there for her in this unsure time. On a related note, when facing down an enemy, Bulma is known to be even more vicious. When she comes face-to-face with Frieza for the first time after his revival, confronting him alongsideher friendsandJaco, Bulma bravely confronts him, addressing the tyrant outright and rudely, though this was due to believing that Gohan and the others utterly outmatched him, and she quickly began backpedaling once Gohan andPiccolopointed out that Frieza was far stronger than before. This turned back around however when she insisted Frieza to wait for Goku; when Frieza agreed to wait only for ten seconds, she began raging and violently cussing him out. She was also shown to use rude and politically incorrect terms regarding specific people during her youth , best demonstrated in her first meeting with General Blue in thefull color manga. After the latter refused her advances in a manner indicating he wasn't into girls, she called him a f--; this was toned down in theVIZtranslation to simply have her say ""phooey, must be gay."" Bulma was shown to have some irritation towards her friends for constantly relying on the Dragon Balls to revive people when dealing with a threat. This eventually came to a head when Piccolo, Goten and Trunks were sealed inside theHyperbolic Time Chamberwhen fightingSuper Buu, where she called them and Krillin out for insisting, they'd revive Goten and Trunks with the Dragon Balls if they died, disapproving of taking the lives of children so lightly. This is comedically contrasted later when, as she grew older, she became so paranoid about losing her good looks that she collected the Dragon Balls to make herself look only 5 years younger and other cosmetic treatments.

Who is Izuku's close pupil in the My Hero Academiamanga and anime series?,Hero All Might,English va,"Lara Woodhull Izuku Midoriya, also known as theOne For All Hero: Deku[4], is the main protagonist of theMy Hero Academiamangaandanimeseries. Even though Izuku was bornQuirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the legendaryHeroAll Might, due to his innate heroism and a strong sense of justice, and has since become his close pupil, as well as a student inClass 1-AatU.A. High School. All Might passed on his transferableQuirkto Izuku, making him the ninth and final wielder ofOne For All. Following theParanormal Liberation War, withTomura ShigarakiandAll For Oneactively targeting Izuku for his Quirk, he decided to leave U.A. before finishing his first year to keep his classmates out of harm's way.[5]After encouragement and support from his friends, he later returns to the school and leads the heroes against the villains in one final battle to save the world. After theFinal War, Izuku managed to defeat Tomura and All For One, but at the cost of rendering himself Quirkless once more. After graduation, Izuku loses the embers of One For All and becomes a teacher at U.A., teaching History. After eight years, advancements in technology allows him to return to active Hero duty, alongside his fellow Class A members, later becoming the No. 4 Pro Hero.[6][4]"
How did Izuku overcome the drawbacks of One For All?,his drive allowed him to withstand the drawbacks of One For All for the most part,Abilities,"Izuku possesses moderate combat skills and fundamental fighting knowledge from his years of hero studies. Overall Abilities: Izuku's greatest asset prior to receiving his Quirk was his vast knowledge of fundamental hero skills and tactics. Izuku studied Pro Heroes for years and is able to apply that knowledge during crisis situations in a practical manner. His immense bravery and desire to become a hero were also important factors in giving him the mentality to protect others. Before gaining his Quirk from All Might, he took on theSludge Villainand rescued Katsuki because of his boldness and application of heroic skills, something that deeply impressed the No. 1 Hero. Upon training with All Might, Izuku inherited One For All from him and was granted the ability to harness a stockpile of powerful energy. He can move faster than the eye can see and take down an enormousVillain Botin a single punch, but the physical backlash at the time prevented Izuku from being able to fight properly or compete with his peers on an even playing field, as throwing a punch or kick with anything beyond moderate force will shatter the bones in his arms and legs. Even so, he still possessed impressive physical durability, and his drive allowed him to withstand the drawbacks of One For All for the most part. Izuku's combat abilities allow him to clash with stronger villains, notably Gentle Criminal. Despite the intense drawbacks of One For All, Izuku's wits provide him with ways to use One For All that is still effective in battle. He also retains his ability to act instinctively based on his notes and possesses basic hand-to-hand combat knowledge. By applying those correctly, Izuku is able to fight toe-to-toe with even the strongest students of Class 1-A, such as Katsuki and Shoto. Under the tutelage of Gran Torino, Izuku acquired more control over One For All, leading to the creation ofFull Cowl, a technique that would eventually become a key component of his fighting style. With Izuku gaining greatly enhanced maneuverability, strength, and a significant reduction in the physical backlash created when using his Quirk uncontrollably, he was able to drastically improve his overall fighting capabilities; his newly attained abilities garnered praise from Gran Torino, who noted that Izuku was on a higher level than he was compared to the Sports Festival.[13]This specific improvement enabled Izuku to compete more closely with his classmates in the physical aspects of the Hero Course and even allows him to fight properly against top villains like theHero Killer: Stain, who had single-handedly bested various Pro Heroes. At 100% power, Izuku was able to hold his own against Tomura. As Izuku's mastery over his Quirk improves, so do his practical skills. Also, when his skills and experience increase, so does his confidence, which is said to be a source of inspiration to his classmates as well.[7]His body, however, still remains relatively vulnerable to One For All's drawbacks, which gives Izuku a disadvantage against enemies like Muscular or Overhaul, whose Quirks were proven to be too powerful against One For All's weaker outputs, forcing scenarios where Izuku had to sacrifice his body in order to go all out. In order to protect his own body, particularly his arms, Izuku eventually develops his own unique fighting style, diverging himself further from All Might's. Currently, Izuku is acknowledged by his classmates as a strong, reliable, leading figure, with both his strength and intelligence being respected equally. However, Izuku's Quirk is still an enigma for them , which makes him an unpredictable ally for better or worse. As Izuku keeps growing, so does One For All, and with the prospect of having new abilities unlocked in the future, Izuku has to work even harder in order to fully dominate the Quirk that was passed to him. By the time of theParanormal Liberation War, Izuku's skills have grown exponentially to the point that he is able to fight alongside exceptional Pro Heroes such asEraser Head, Gran Torino, and even the current number one Pro Hero,Endeavor. But his biggest feat thus far is holding his own against the Grand Commander of the Liberation Front, Tomura Shigaraki, who has inherited All For One and has a modified body with strength comparable to All Might, and forcing the all-powerful villain on the defensive despite the latter easily overpowering the top Pro Heroes. Following the aftermath of the Paranormal Liberation War, Izuku has displayed even greater mastery over his Quirks and showcased the ability to easily outmaneuver his enemies withBlackwhipand 45% of One For All,detect dangerwithout gaining sensory overload, proveEnwrong by creating a newUltimate MoveusingSmokescreen, and easily alternate between his arsenal of Quirks in his fights with Muscular and Lady Nagant. In hisfightagainst Class 1-A, Izuku displayed himself to be easily capable of fighting on even terms with some of U.A. High School's most powerful students and was shown capable of completely dominating them even when severely outnumbered before succumbing to exhaustion and stress. During the course of theFinal War, Izuku has improved over the span of a month, where he is the only one who has a chance at defeating the fully powered Tomura, and in their final encounter, he has achieved equal standing with Tomura in terms of strength and speed despite the latter changing into his final form. Later in the fight, Izuku demonstrates a level of immense power that he is capable of annihilating Tomura's fingers and arm, with Tomura even acknowledging Izuku could finish him off with a single full powered blow, but since he refuses to kill him, is forced on the defensive instead. Trained Muscles: Usage of One For All requires the user to have strong muscles, as One For All is a lot to handle and could cause the user's body to be blown apart if they don't possess the necessary bodily strength. Having been trained by All Might for 10 months in order to get his body physically ready to inherit One For All, Izuku gained a muscular physique that lets him perform at parameters higher than that of an average student outside U.A.'s hero course. During theQuirk Apprehension Test, he demonstrated a grip strength of 56 kilograms and the ability to run the 50-meter dash in 7.02 seconds . Even after these events, Deku diligently trains his muscles every day and becomes physically stronger throughout the series. He is often seen running laps and using dumbbells or grippers to train during his free time. Deku can also be observed doing the air chair exercise during the breaks between classes. Izuku continues fighting even with broken fingers. Immense Stamina: Izuku has shown on many occasions that he is capable of handling large amounts of pain. Such times were mostly side-effects of overusing his Quirk and frequently led to various broken bones. Izuku is able to avoid those repercussions by staying in a safe range of One For All power output . Should he be forced to output more power, Izuku is still capable of fighting decently even with broken limbs thanks to the effects of adrenaline, but will succumb to exhaustion a while later. Izuku also has to be wary of his arms, which have grown damaged due to his repeated injuries and could eventually stop working altogether if he doesn't restrain himself. After multiple months of hard work and training with the No. 1 Pro Hero Endeavor, Izuku has become much sturdier and resilient when it comes to the drawbacks of his Quirk, allowing him to withstand the recoil from 100% attacks without being instantly incapacitated. He has also shown an even greater pain threshold, when he managed to endure multiple smash attacks at 100% and attacks from Tomura while still standing. Izuku has shown to even be capable of operating for days on-end without eating or sleeping, going across Japan and fighting multiple villains. Even when severe sleep deprivation and physical exhaustion accumulated, Izuku still fought against powerful villains for nearly a month and made it very difficult for his former classmates to restrain him for a lengthy period of time before finally collapsing. Izuku was also able to withstand overusingGearshiftafter its five minute limit was up, though had to wait several minutes to cool down or face complete loss of breath. Later in his final battle with Tomura, Izuku showed to be capable of battling the villain even when experiencing near paralyzing pain and being unable to breathe properly due to the recoil of Gearshift. After All for One regains control over Tomura’s body, Izuku proves able to continue fighting the villain even with all the damage accumulated earlier in the battle and only using the remaining embers of One for All. Immense Strength: Even without his Quirk, Izuku has shown high levels of physical strength for a person his age. During his training with All Might , he was shown to be able to lift him on his back while walking. During the sports festival, he could lift a slab of metal roughly the size of his body and wield it as an effective weapon to cleave a one-point bot in two. Demonstrably, using One For All at steadily higher percentages ends up enhancing his body to superhuman levels in order to be capable of doing so. When using One For All, his strength further increases to a variety of boundless levels: at 5%, he can shatter metal pillars with a single punch, at 8%, he can lift a steel I beam one-handed. At 15%, he could lift several vehicles in the air with the aid of Blackwhip. At 30%, he can lift a bus full of people one-handed and run fast enough to evade Tomura's decay and restrain the enhanced Tomura with aid from Blackwhip and his anger. During theDark Hero Arc, Izuku's strength increases even further and he can now use 45% as his regular output with no backlash. Using 45%, he could defeat a weakened Muscular with a single punch when he was unsuccessful before, casually collapse a building when fighting his classmates, and even managed to break out ofFumikage Tokoyami'sRagnarök, shocking his friends.[14][15] At 100%, Izuku's strength surpasses even the level of All Might, this allows him to commit astonishing feats. He could easily destroy a massive Villain Bot with a single punch, annihilate a twelve story building, create torrents of wind pressure with a flick of his fingers, and create a massive explosion with a single punch. With the Second User's Quirk, Gearshift, and the Third User's Fa Jin combined, he can make his punches even faster and build immense kinetic energy feedback, inflicting catastrophic damage to ""Tomura"" during the Final War, as each punch breaks the sound barrier, to the point Mirio notices the delayed sound of the punches before it can be heard. This combination increases his strength from his 100% limit to what is described as 120% in power. Tomura admits that if Izuku landed a direct attack without holding anything back, even his body wouldn't be able to regenerate. In the final battle against All For One, despite only possessing the remaining embers of One For All, he was still the only one capable of harming the villain. With his final strike, he made his greatest feat of strength yet when he not only destroyed Tomura's crumbling body and reduced it to ashes, but also blew away the massive storm created by Shoto, Endeavor, and Dabi, clearing the weather of not only all of Japan, but also across America. This final attack was also so powerful that America was still experiencing strong winds days after it happened. Afterwards, Izuku is also shown to be capable of easily lifting debris and rubble despite not using his remaining One For All embers. Even compared to the pros, Izuku demonstrates a high degree of bodily strength and keen insight into how to leverage it best that isn't tied to any Quirk. Immense Speed and Reflexes: Izuku possesses great speed and reflexes with and without Full Cowl. He can react in time to defend from Shoto's ice which has been shown to occur in the literal blink of an eye and can keep up with Katsuki's movements in their first fight. When using Full Cowl, his reflexes and movement speed elevates to higher levels; at 5%, he can keep up with Tenya'sRecipro Burstwhich can move faster than the eye can see, at 8%, he proved to surpass Katsuki's own speed and quickly and easily overwhelmed Hitoshi in combat in spite of Hitoshi's improvements, at 20%, he could outpace Overhaul and at 30%, he can keep up with the enhanced Tomura's speed. At 45%, he was capable of keeping up with Lady Nagant's bullet and was even capable of dodging several of her shots, as well as keeping up with Muscular's movements which he previously could not follow. Izuku's Faux 100% speed makes him faster than a sniper bullet. At 100%, his speed rises to levels rivaling or even surpassing that of All Might, which allows him to casually blitz capable villains and move several times faster than the eye can see. During his fight with Overhaul, he could completely outspeed the villain and move fast enough to create afterimages, and later completely overwhelm him with an instantaneous rush of punches. When fighting against Tomura Shigaraki, he could effortlessly blitz the villain and severely damage his weakened body, despite him possessing speed rivaling that of All Might and outclassing that of Gran Torino. With his Faux 100%, Izuku's speed is on par with All Might's in his prime. Izuku overtook a already fired and moving sniper bullet from Lady Nagant. This allowed him to reach and push Overhaul aside, even before the bullet was able to finish the last small part of the entire distance. With this technique, his speed is so great that, even in an exhausted state, it took the combined effort of Class-A just to catch up with him. After Izuku unlocked and mastered the Second User of One For All's Quirk, Gearshift, his speed is incredibly enhanced, enabling him to leave the sound of his attacks far behind his movements. His speed has increased so drastically that every punch he makes delayed a sound before it can be heard. ""Tomura"" stated that even his eyes are completely incapable of keeping up with him at this speed. More impressively, Izuku is shown to be able to react to Tomura in a millisecond and cut his fingers off the instant they touched his face before hisDecaycould activate. However, after his Danger Sense was stolen, Izuku's reflexes have taken a sharp downward spiral, but was still able to react to Tomura's onslaught of attacks that blasts him all the way to Mt. Fuji. Immense Durability: Izuku has shown the ability to withstand explosions from Katsuki without One For All and with 5% he's taken building-sized explosions from Katsuki and attacks from Muscular. At 30% of his power, he's withstood blows from the enhanced Tomura, who is said to have power rivalling All Might himself. At 45%, he withstood being shot by Lady Nagant and even managed to survive a massive explosion triggered by All For One. Upon facing his classmates, Izuku was capable of withstanding several powerful attacks such as Fumikage's Ragnarök, ramming full-speed into Shoto's Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall, and even withstanding a collapsing building with little to no injuries. During Izuku's fight with Flect Turn, he showed to be capable of withstanding many of his own smash attacks being reflected against him and sending him crashing through the surrounding area multiple times. Later in the fight, he survived being shot by multiple lasers and lost a significant amount of blood, yet he continued to battle the villain fiercely despite his injuries. At 100%, Izuku's durability and endurance rise to extreme levels, making him appear virtually invulnerable to physical trauma. In his fight against Tomura Shigaraki, he could withstand several attacks from the PLF leader and his own Quirk's backlash. In his fight against Nine, Izuku proved easily capable of completely nullifying several of the villain's attacks. However, Izuku's durability has shown to depend on the amount of injuries he has sustained, with minimal injuries providing the greatest results. In his final battle with Tomura, Izuku showed to be capable of receiving a powerful punch from the villain with no injuries when the villain’s quirks were erased. His durability and endurance increase further when he uses blackwhip to shield himself from Tomura’s attacks after he regained his quirks, using it internally and externally to withstand the major damage and avoid lethal wounds. Izuku studying while strengthening his hands. Keen Intellect: Izuku has proven to be exceptionally intelligent on many occasions, displaying both keen observational and analytical skills as well as sharp intuition and resourcefulness. His grades are among the highest of his class, showing that his One For All training rarely interferes with his studying. Izuku's intelligence has probably been a more useful asset to him than One For All so far. Izuku is a quick learner, which has helped him figure out most of One For All's mechanisms in a short span of time and work around its limitations. While some of his moves have been directly inspired by All Might , the majority of Izuku's moves and techniques were all conceived by him during sudden sparks of inspiration, proof of his creativity. Izuku also has extensive knowledge of Pro Heroes, his classmates, and their Quirks, taking notes of them in great detail in hisHero Analysis for the Future.[8]This is fruit of excellent observational skills coupled with his own desires in becoming a hero by learning from the best, meaning that Izuku always has a natural interest in expanding his knowledge further and further. Izuku is an exceptional strategist and tactician. By combining his aforementioned quick learning and knowledge about Quirks, Izuku is able to devise plans that take advantage of his friends' abilities to the fullest. Izuku's calculations have been crucial at several moments of his school life, allowing him to earn victories, such as in theBattle Trial; escape dangerous situations, such as theU.S.J. Incident; and save lives, such as in theVanguard Action Squad InvasionandKamino Incident. Indeed, inhis battle with his classmates, he used his knowledge of their powers to his advantage and easily overcame a majority of them, shocking a few of them with his skill.[15][16] His intelligence is greatly respected by everyone in Class 1-A as many of his peers look up to him for planning and follow his strategies to the bottom line. EvenMomo Yaoyorozu, the smartest student in the class, has looked up to Izuku as a reference.[17] Adaptability: Thanks to his analytical abilities, Izuku is able to replicate the techniques of others. For example, after training with Gran Torino and gaining minor mastery of One For All, Izuku was able to duplicate Katsuki's moves during a training exercise. After training and drawing inspiration from his classmate,Tsuyu Asui, Izuku has become proficient enough with Blackwhip to generate a dark tendril from his tongue, allowing him to replicate her ""Froppy Style"" combat. After unlocking more assimilated Quirks from One For All, Izuku can craft and combine some of the Quirks to make custom Ultimate Moves such asBlackchain,Faux 100 Percent, andFaux 100 Percent: Manchester Smash. Furthermore, during his final battle with Tomura Shigaraki, upon becoming immobilized from the use of Gearshift, he used Blackwhip to flex and extend his muscles manually from within, allowing him to build up Fa Jin and swing his arm. Izuku at the forefront of Class 1-A. Leadership Skills: As a natural consequence of his bravery and strategic mindset, Izuku has displayed incredible leadership skills on various occasions. By the start of his U.A. life, Izuku had already earned the trust ofOchaco Urarakaand Tenya thanks to his actions in theU.A. Entrance Exam, which was enough to allow him to be voted class representative early on, although he relinquished the position to Tenya shortly after. Tsuyu andMinoru Minetaalso placed their faith on Izuku during the U.S.J. Incident, following his instructions with little hesitation. By the time of theFirst Term Final Exam, he had already fought alongside Katsuki and Shoto, who were previously antagonistic to him. Izuku might not be aware of this, but he is one of the main motivators within his class alongside Katsuki, thanks to a combination of his heroic drive and practical intellect.[7] Indomitable Will: Throughout the series, and as one of his greatest traits, Izuku displayed an extraordinary level of willpower. Following his dream to become the greatest hero, Izuku develops great determination and willpower. While feeble and doubtful at the beginning, Izuku steadily developed and proved his strong willpower against far menacing adversaries, people doubting and believing in him, and proven to be stronger than many of his classmates. He was the first one to move his body after All For One induced great fear onto him and his classmates. Even when Sir Nighteye foresaw Izuku's death and Eri's failed rescue, he refused to give up and promised to change fate. He has constantly displayed the ability to never give up no matter how severe the injury. When fighting Overhaul, Izuku continuously steeled his resolve to save and protect Eri. Even after being severely injured and feeling the drawbacks of using One For All at 20%, he still kept on fighting against the villain until going all-out with 100%. During the Paranormal Liberation War, Izuku displayed his resistance against Tomura's terrifying aura. While he did hallucinate his death for a moment, he quickly recovered from it and showed no fear when confronting the villain. When all hope seemed lost, Izuku decided to do everything in his disposal to stop Tomura, no matter what would happen to himself afterwards and knowingly going for the risk of forever losing his arms or worse. Even after shattering his arms and legs and horrifically injuring himself, he developed theFroppy Stylewith Blackwhip after being inspired by Tsuyu Asui and desperately attempted to capture Tomura. Izuku refusing to give up on the child within Tomura. After the Paranormal Liberation War,Yo Shindonotices the change and development of Izuku's willpower, stating that he gives off a totally different vibe. Even when Izuku went to confront All For One in the Haibori Woods mansion, he only showed his anger-filled eyes and determination of defeating him. During theDark Hero Arc, Izuku's will takes a large toll as he begins to succumb to the stress and trauma of the war, as well as leaving U.A. He began to over-exert himself, under-eat, and constantly fend off villains, while showing extremely worrying behavior. He eventually decides to leave behind All Might in order to track down the PLF himself. In reality, Izuku chose to commit these actions to protect his friends from anymore harm, not wanting more people to get hurt or killed due to his actions. This behavior is further enforced after the horrific disfigurement of Lady Nagant right in front of his eyes, which further increased his rage and hatred towards All For One. Eventually, after being rescued by his friends, having Katsuki Bakugo apologize to him for his actions, and Ochaco Uraraka publicly defend him, he finally leaves behind this depressive state and steels his resolve to fight against the villains. By the time of the Final War, even though Izuku becomes outmatched by Tomura's power, with One For All vulnerable to be stolen and the villain on the verge of destroying Mt. Fuji, Izuku still won't give up and stands against Tomura with no sign of fear. This trait is why Kudo was strongly opposing Izuku as the successor of One For All at first, not because he's a peace-seeking or his desire to save one's archenemy to be a delusional madness, but because of his strong driven notion to save anyone, whether the most vile among them or the Quirkless, as each one of them as an innately human heart. His willpower was so motivated that even with his muscles being torn and suffering through Gearshift's recoil backlash, Izuku still keeps on fighting through. Even within the realm of One For All, and All For One, Izuku's extraordinary willpower was so strong that he was able to withstand against Tomura's immense hatred inside of his core, and make Tomura bend to his will in the final battle. Even after losing his arms, and All For One taking back control of Tomura, Izuku refused to give up fighting. Despite losing his Quirk with only the last embers of One For All, he still manages to turn the spark into a raging inferno similar to All Might's, as he was able to push himself to the brink and dealt the finishing blow to destroy All For One's vestige once and for all, at the cost of ending Tomura's life, with the villain conceding in defeat before succumbing to his injuries and dies as his body disintegrates into ashes."
How was Izuku able to handle 45% of his full power without breaking his bones?,his body has become more accustomed to bracing for the strain,Former quirks,"Izuku utilizing 20% of One For All. One For All: Transferred to him from Toshinori Yagi, Izuku's Quirk allowed him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to various boundless levels. This resulted in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability. When Izuku activated One For All, red, vein-like lines course throughout the empowered part of his body. Izuku could focus the stockpiled power into a single body part, or spread it across his entire body evenly, though, focusing the power in a single part puts a greater strain on that part of his body. He was also able to control what percentage of his full power that he uses. Since he was not born with this power, his body was not naturally suited to handle it, however, over time and with continued training with it, his body has become more accustomed to bracing for the strain. He was able to handle 45% of his full power without breaking his bones, with 30% being his normal output.[18] The vestige world of One For All. In addition to the stockpiling power, Izuku also had access to a subconscious realm where vestiges of the consciousnesses of the previous One For All holders dwell. These vestiges could trigger Izuku to activate One For All without any conscious input from himself, as seen when he was under the control of Hitoshi'sBrainwashingQuirk and illusionary shadows of these echoes appeared in his vision. Izuku had little to no control over this aspect of One For All, being unable to freely enter or exit, his body not being fully materialized, which limited his movement within the realm, and only being able to talk through muffled sounds since his mouth has not fully manifested yet. However, Izuku had reached the point where he can freely communicate with the vestiges of the previous users while still conscious. Izuku is the first holder of One For All known to have gained access to this realm while still alive.[19][20] Izuku was granted access to the Quirks of the previous owners of One For All, but he has since transferred all of them to Tomura in an effort to defeat him.[21]In addition to transferring the Quirks of One For All, Izuku also transferred One For All itself to Tomura, leaving him with only the ""leftover embers"".[22]"

What color is Katsuki's uniform?,black,Appearance,"Katsuki is a young man of above-average height, with a slim, muscular build, and a fair skin tone. He has short, spiky, sandy blond hair with choppy bangs that hang over his eyebrows. His eyes are sharp and bright red in color. During his time inAlderaJunior High School, similar toIzuku, he wore a plain blackgakuranuniform with yellow buttons, accompanied by brown loafers. While at home, he wears a greenjinbeiover a white shirt and gray sweatpants. At U.A., he wears the standard U.A. uniform without the customary red tie, a few buttons undone at the top of his white collared shirt, and his pants are worn loosely, sagging at his ankles, despite him wearing a belt with them. After theParanormal Liberation War, Katsuki's school uniform is worn in a much neater fashion and includes the red tie he previously forwent. His herocostumeconsists of a tight, black, sleeveless tank top featuring an orange ""X"" across the middle, creating a V-neck design. There are two black dots along the left side of the collar, which is the trademark of his costume's designer,Sasori Nimaru[9][10]The outfit includes a metallic neck brace with rectangular ends, each having three holes on either side. He wears black sleeves that extend from large, grenade-like gauntlets up to his biceps, finishing with thin orange tips. A green and orange belt, equipped with grenades, secures his baggy pants that have green straps and knee guards. On his feet, he sports black, knee-high combat boots with orange soles, eight eyelets, and straps at the top. His mask is jagged and black, with a large, orange-rimmed flare shape protruding from each side around the eyes. While interning underBest Jeanist, the Fiber Hero attempted to teach Katsuki the importance of maintaining a positive appearance. To that end, he took the liberty of making some changes to Katsuki's outward appearance to make him look less intimidating. During this tenure, his wild spiky hair was combed into a neat side part. Best Jeanist also made changes to Katsuki's Hero costume; he got rid of Katsuki's mask and grenade gauntlets and had him wear a pair of smart blue denim jeans in place of his usual baggy pants. In the winter months, he wears a large jacket with a high collar and four orange eyelets on the collar and two on each shoulder, rather than the usual tank top, although it does maintain the same orange ""X"" design, the purpose of which he can still sweat a sufficient amount in the cold weather, given how hisQuirkworks. ForMission: Humarise, Katsuki and his fellow internees at theEndeavor Agencyare given special advanced stealth costumes by theWorld Heroes Associationfor their mission toOtheon. Based on the winter variant of his costume, Katsuki designed his stealth costume to be all neoprene black with the exception of orange ""X"", the soles of his boots, and his gloves while retaining the metal kneepads and his metallic neck brace has two holes on each side instead of three. The Grenadier Bracers were redesigned to be shaped like flashbang grenades rather than frag grenades. He also has two silver plates on his shoulders with the letters ""WHA"" and two straps coming down from his neck brace with a red button on the left. Due to the injuries he sustained during theParanormal Liberation War, Katsuki has two scars on his body: an impacted one near the base of his left shoulder that stretches to his clavicle, and one on his lower stomach area. By the time of theFinal War, Katsuki now wears his Winter Costume to maximize his sweat production, increasing his need for condensed explosions from his nitroglycerin. During his final battle againstTomura Shigaraki, he utilizes a support gear called theStrafe Panzer, which consists of six barreled heavy cannons and two shoulder-pad smaller cannons as aim sights; the cannons are loaded with a belt feed containing nitroglycerin stored in each capsule, giving Katsuki more sweat ammunition or for bigger explosions. In the fight, the Strafe Panzer is destroyed and his right arm is badly crushed by the villain, while the right side of his face is heavily scarred. After a near death experience due to his heart being ruptured by an attack from Tomura, said hole now has a suture scar thanks to being resuscitated back to life byEdgeshot. To mend his broken right arm, All Might gives him his remaining equipment from hisArmored All Mightsuit, the ""Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight"", acting as a splint. In the aftermath of the battle, Katsuki's right arm became heavily scarred much like Izuku's, and despite the surgery is unable to move it again, with a prominent impact scar stretching from his elbow to his clavicle. Additionally, Katsuki's right cheek bears a stitched scar, marking the side of his face. He reverts to his standard hero costume, now modified with a long black sleeve that envelops his entire right arm and shoulder. He even wears the black sleeve in order to support the heavy damage in his civilian attire and uniform. During his remaining school years, Katsuki was able to rehabilitate his right arm until he was able to move it again, restoring its normal functions. Eight years after the end of the Final War, Katsuki has grown taller, more muscular, and leaner. His hero costume still retains the same design as he wore from U.A., but the Grenadier Bracers have been redesigned to be more streamlined, giving them the shape of smoke grenades instead of the usual grenade design, featuring silver sights fastened to every knuckle. In addition, he wears two braids at the back of his head, designed to look like lit fuses."
What is Katsuki's usual fighting expression?,overconfidence,Personality,"Katsuki showcasing his overconfidence. Katsuki is a crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and aggressive person, especially at the beginning of the series. Katsuki tends to come off as unheroic; this problematic behavior going all the way back to his early childhood days when he was known to bully a young,Quirkless,Izuku Midoriya. He showed to be extremely arrogant and condescending to those around him, often bragging of hisExplosionQuirk's power, and even boasting that he would take on his entire middle school class. He showed open hostility towards Izuku, mainly because of his former Quirkless status, and would frequently put down his dream of becoming a Hero, despite lacking a Quirk, and also gave him the insulting nickname ""Deku"" . He even threatened Izuku not to apply to U.A. High School and became angry upon both of them passing the Entrance Exam, wanting to be the only person from his middle school to make it there. However, after being accepted into U.A. and experiencing several personal defeats, one of them even coming from Izuku, Katsuki has gradually changed into a less antagonistic person, albeit still retaining a lot of his unpleasant traits. While often portrayed negatively, Katsuki's fierce character and competitive drive have actually granted him an important role among Class 1-A, as a sort of inspirational mood-maker.[11] Katsuki's usual fighting expression. Determined and thirsty for victory, Katsuki smiles eerily when in the middle of a battle. He is incredibly focused on achieving his own authentic victories and has learned to never underestimate his opponents. Katsuki is not only very athletic and talented at fighting, but also very intelligent and extremely perceptive, capable of strategic planning and improvisation. Moreover, Katsuki's grades are among the highest of his class and he already knew how to read perfectly by the age of four, evidence that he treats studying seriously.[12][5]Katsuki also possesses surprising talent in other areas, such as cooking and music, even though he doesn't show a particular interest in them.[13][14]Overall, Katsuki is considered a natural-born genius with the potential to be one of the best Pro Heroes around. Eijiro's first impression of Katsuki. While a rather volatile hero-in-training who reacts and snaps more than thinking, Katsuki is smart enough to discern who his enemies and allies are. He is not particularly nice or open with people who are on his side, or anyone else for that matter, but will act less unfriendly and sometimes even kind to those that manage to earn his respect. Because of his attitude and vulgar language, Katsuki's U.A. classmates often react negatively to him, although they have come to appreciate his skills and warm up to his personality.[15]Katsuki matures slowly through his time at U.A., coming to befriend some of his classmates and willingly engaging in social interaction with them, though remaining solitary for the most part. Like he does with Izuku, Katsuki has a habit of bestowing insulting nicknames upon others, such as callingTenya Ida""Four Eyes"" because of his glasses,Denki Kaminari""Dunce-Face"" because of how hisElectrificationQuirk dulls his thinking,Shoto Todoroki""Half and Half"" or ""Icy-Hot"" because of his dualQuirkand appearance, and so on. He also refers to people he doesn't know as ""extras"", treating them as little more than fodder or stepping stones to his victory until he faces them head-on. Despite this, he can address others properly when it matters, such as when he's serious or in the heat of battle. Katsuki trying to intimidate Shoto with Explosion. Katsuki tends to disregard the notion that Quirks shouldn't be used in public and will activate his Quirk for a number of reasons, such as to intimidate someone, to punctuate a point, out of frustration, or even if he just feels like showing off. Overall, Katsuki doesn't seem to care very much about what others think of him, barely containing himself from violent behavior .[16]Katsuki values honesty highly and never lies to the point his brash candor is seen by some as rude and insensitive. He is never afraid of speaking his mind and will notice when people are not being truthful to him. This shows that, despite his anti-social habits, Katsuki is an excellent judge of character, making it hard to deceive him. Katsuki unhappy with his first place at the Sports Festival. Due to the constant praise of his abilities and powerful Quirk, Katsuki has developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything. As pointed out by many people, Katsuki loves to win above all else and cannot stand it when he doesn't, leading him to lose his already short temper or, less often, sulk. He is fiercely competitive and will never settle for less than the number one spot, having a compulsive need to always strive for victory and also prove people who doubt him wrong. However, Katsuki also values hard work and fair play, to the point of refusing to acknowledge a winning result if he feels that his victory was not earned by actual merit. Along with that, he detests being pitied or looked down on by others, and will hold contempt towards those that don't take him seriously, while recognizing the effort of those that manage to put up a challenge against him, like, for example,Ochaco UrarakaandEijiro Kirishima. Because of his Quirk and talents, Katsuki is very confident and brave to where he is willing to go against anyone who challenges him. He never backs down from a fight and will go out when facing such a powerful opponent. From taking on several villains at theUnforeseen Simulation Joint, Katsuki knows when dealing with someone that is out of his league, as he letAll Mightface off againstNomu. During theFirst Term Final Exam, Katsuki wasn't afraid to go up against All Might, even though he knew he had a low chance of taking him down head on. Katsuki saving his allies from danger. Katsuki is immensely prideful and prefers to act alone, as he hates the idea of being protected or having to rely on other people to assist him unless, in the latter's case, he is recognized as the unquestionable leading figure within a team. At the beginning of the series, Katsuki's cooperativeness was nothing short of atrocious, often ignoring his partners' ideas and suggestions for his own very direct approaches. His teamwork skills gradually improve as the series progresses, even if Katsuki keeps coming off as condescending through his usual tone. However, it's clear he now acknowledges their importance, protecting them from harm while expecting them to do the same for him in return. As a leader, Katsuki is a merciless perfectionist, and will only become satisfied with complete, indisputable victories. Katsuki refusing Izuku's help once more, reflecting their childhood. Katsuki often has difficulty accepting his mistakes and learning from his shortcomings, and will fiercely deny them whenever they are pointed out by others, regardless of who does it. That doesn't mean, however, that Katsuki doesn't listen to advice, having come to realize his faults and how to somewhat improve on them thanks to the words and actions of other people like All Might and Best Jeanist, but he will never outright admit due to his pride. He prefers to self-reflect in silence and solitude, becoming a bit more brooding during those periods. Katsuki's unchecked pride and aggression has cost him victories on numerous occasions, like theBattle Trialor theProvisional Hero License Exam, and it tends to worsen whenever Izuku is involved. Both characters share a sensitive history with each other, with Katsuki, in particular, being unable to completely overcome his issues with Izuku, although this has not stopped them from working together many times.[17] Katsuki's wounded pride. Katsuki has a more vulnerable side, having been led to tears due to damaged pride a few times. After the Battle Trial, Katsuki admitted that when he saw Shoto Todoroki's power and Izuku's ability to outsmart him, he couldn't beat him head on and called out howMomo Yaoyorozuwas right about how reckless he was during his fight with Izuku. Katsuki has also shown moments of fear and guilt, the latter due to viewing himself and his own weakness as the cause of All Might losing his remaining power and retiring as a hero. Still, due to years of misunderstandings, tension, and pride, Katsuki has difficulty doing the same thing towards Izuku. By the time of the Remedial Course, Katsuki had started to mature a little to the point that he was able to advise a kid, who acted similarly to him, that if he continued to look down on others then he would not realize his own mistakes. Despite this growth, he has certain personality traits that he doesn't immediately get over, like joining the Class 1-A band during theU.A. School Festivalunder the pretense of ""beating the other classes through music"", or calling his classmates in theJoint Training Battle""underlings"". During his internship at the Endeavor Agency, he also beratesBurninfor speaking so loudly in the morning, despite having been scolded by his mother for doing the very same thing. Katsuki also has an honorable side to him. Though he insisted that Izuku was unhelpful in trying to save him from the Sludge Villain, he did stop bullying him for ten months afterward, only resuming after they both got into U.A. While he didn't believe about Izuku's Quirk belonging to someone else as well as falsely assuming that Izuku had been hiding it from him the entire time, when he learned ofAll For Oneandhis Quirk, he started to believe Izuku's words and pieced it together after seeing All Might's true form, confronting the former about his assumption. After All Might confirmed his deduction, Katsuki vowed to keepOne For Alla secret, being one of the initial few people to know about the true power of the Quirk. Also, when Katsuki realized the true reasons he bullied Izuku, he was remorseful enough to attempt to atone for it by helping him master One For All. Alongside Izuku, Katsuki shows his undying admiration for All Might by shouting for the hero to win. While his inspiration for becoming a hero was the same as Izuku's, the Symbol of Peace, All Might, their beliefs differ: Katsuki feels a hero should never stop fighting or give up, regardless of the threat they face, and that always winning is the mark of a true hero. Furthermore, various heroes, civilians, and evenvillainshave commented on his arrogance and conceit. However, Katsuki is unwavering in his aspirations of heroism, having outright refused Tomura Shigaraki's proposal for him to join theLeague of Villainsbecause he views the villains as people who lose and not win like heroes. It is later revealed that Katsuki decided to help Izuku train One For All to atone for his actions of not helping. During Katsuki's discussion with All Might about his connections to Izuku, Katsuki admitted that he bullied Izuku as an outlet for his own insecurities and how he couldn't understand why Izuku would put others before himself. In truth, Katsuki really cares for Izuku despite how he acts, and wishes for him to continue improving his strength and Quirks, unlike before where he ridiculed Izuku's efforts and told him how he wouldn't amount to anything. His caring and protective side is further proven when he heard that Tomura was targeting One For All, immediately realizing that the villain leader would be going after Izuku and made attempts to keep Tomura away from him. Finally coming to terms with everything, Katsuki apologizes to Izuku. After Izuku left U.A. in order to face All For One alone, as well as to protect his friends and family from danger, Katsuki, along with his classmates, departed from the school in order to bring him back. Following a battle to get Izuku to come to his senses, Katsuki genuinely apologizes to the former for his actions while calling Izuku by his first name, displaying his regret over trying to usurp Izuku's strengths by putting him down and for bullying him in the past. This proves that Katsuki is repentant over his own faults, with him finally being able to face his feelings and the past in order to atone for how he was. Despite this, upon returning to U.A., he makes it clear that his goal of becoming the strongest hero hasn't changed and that Izuku along with the rest of his classmates are still his rivals. Following the Final War, Katsuki accepts his injuries and shows his willingness to go ahead with rehabilitation, not wishing to have his broken right arm amputated and limit his Quirk. However, Katsuki becomes truly shocked upon learning that Izuku has been rendered Quirkless after his final battle against Tomura, recalling how he once bullied Izuku and his growth during their time at U.A. High School. This news was enough to reduce Katsuki to tears, with him confessing that he thought he would be chasing after Izuku for the rest of their lives, demonstrating how Katsuki has come to truly support Izuku from all the years of conflict between them. Eight years later, Katsuki has graduated from U.A. High, becoming a notoriously strong Pro Hero. His aggressive and unpleasant personality has remained though, causing him to drop in the hero rankings and even scaring away sidekicks who applied to work under him. Even so, Katsuki's bond with Izuku has remained intact, to the point where he lead a funding forMei HatsumeandMelissa Shieldto create a mechanized suit for Izuku, which all of Class A contributed to. With their efforts allowing Izuku to become a hero again, Katsuki offers his hand to him as they all leap into action. While his high temper is still present, Katsuki has also become more humble in his own way, saying that he would be willing to take on any sidekicks if they genuinely wanted to surpass him while subtly trying to invite Izuku to his agency. He also tells Izuku to think more highly of himself, saying that he will overlook things if he doesn't, and that giving everyone special treatment means that no one is truly special to him, words that later prompt Izuku to reconnect with Ochaco."
What does Katsuki's Quirk allow him to do?,create strong explosions,Quirk,"Katsuki employing his Quirk's versatility in his fighting style. Explosion: Katsuki's Quirk allows him to secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from the palms of his hands and ignite it on command, allowing him to create strong explosions.[5]The more Katsuki sweats, the stronger his explosions become.[20]If Katsuki overuses this power, his forearms will start to ache. Katsuki has a strong grasp on the applications of his Quirk, something that was acknowledged by Best Jeanist, a top Pro Hero; not only can Katsuki use the explosions for attacking, he can also use them to propel himself and navigate through the air at high speeds, allowing him to fly at his opponents without giving them time to react,[21]as well as evade incoming attacks, even while in the air.[22][23]The shockwave from an explosion can even be used as a shield. Katsuki can keep up his explosions continuously, long enough to break through Eijiro's hardening Quirk[22]and negate Shoto's ""Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall"" for a short while before being overwhelmed.[23]As part of his training, Katsuki submerged his hands into boiling water to expand his sweat glands, then created chain explosions toward the sky to increase the scale of his attacks. After his near death experience by Tomura's hand, his Quirk underwent an Awakening. This allowed his Explosions to be stronger and more condensed, allowing Katsuki to reach higher speeds. He was later able to achieve a level of Explosion power allowing him to create ginormous explosions that are strong enough to contest against All For One."

What color is Toshinori's golden age hero costume?,blue,Appearance,"In his empowered form, Toshinori is a towering figure with a muscular and well-defined physique, resembling a classic Western comic book superhero. He has chiseled facial features, including a strong jawline, pronounced cheekbones, and bushy eyebrows. His short blond hair is swept backward, with two distinct tufts that stick up slightly to each side. His robust features often cast a shadow over his face, revealing only his striking blue eyes. Toshinori's Golden Age hero costume consists of a skin-tight blue bodysuit adorned with a red symbol that resembles a ""Y."" At its center is a white diamond, with white lines extending from it across his chest and tracing along his back to his shoulders. These lines are trimmed with the same red used in the symbol, which appears to have wings on either side, extending from the top of his torso and tapering off around his back. Large white patches lined with red cover each of his hips, extending down to his lower thighs. He wears a gold belt with a silver buckle featuring red eyes. His forearm sleeves are gold, decorated with white lines and blue accents over his wrists, complemented by spiked fins on the sides of his arms. Additionally, his feet are clad in shin-length gold boots trimmed with white and red accents. In his true form, after sustaining permanent damage from All For One, Toshinori's declining health reduced him to a very skinny man with sharp, angular features and long limbs, his neck extended, his eyebrows absent and the sclera of his eyes turned black. His hair is wavy, with two long strands coming down from his hairline and framing his face. He possesses a large scar covering most of the left side of his chest, having lost his stomach and some of his lungs' respiratory system. It is common for him to spout blood from his mouth when excited or surprised. He typically wears baggy clothing to accommodate the change in body mass between forms, but after Toshinori's tenure as a hero, he starts wearing clothes that fit him in his regular form, as he no longer needs big clothes that fit his muscle form. In his early career, Toshinori was a lean but fit young man with the same hairstyle as his true form. In his empowered state, his facial features were noticeably softer. In both his normal and empowered form, Toshinori did not have shadowed eyes on his face, fully showing his white sclerae while retaining the deep blue irises of his eyes, possibly showing how he was not a shell of his former self. During his final confrontation with All For One in theFinal War, Toshinori dons a high-tech suit of armor dubbed the ""Armored All Might"" from his car,Hercules. The mechanical suit resembles his old hero costume and comprises several robotic pieces that can be detached and applied. It covers Toshinori's entire body, exposing only his mouth so he can still show his iconic smile.[9]Throughout the battle, Toshinori's legs are crushed, and the suit is destroyed.[10] After being saved from death by Katsuki and Izuku, All Might's eyes regain their white sclerae, like in his younger days, albeit still covered by shadow lines,[11]as well as his eyebrows being visualized in the aftermath of the Final War. After his legs were crushed, All Might is bound to a wheelchair while he continues to recover from his injuries. Eight years later, All Might has acquired more wrinkles around his face, though his eyebrows and the white sclerae of his eyes have remained. He has also regained his ability to walk.[4]"
What is the name of Toshinori's Quirk?,One For All,Former quirk,"One For All: Transferred to him from Nana Shimura, Toshinori's Quirk allowed him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, significantly enhancing all of his physical abilities to a superhuman level, resulting in unbelievable feats of strength, speed, agility, and durability. Unlike other known users of this Quirk, Toshinori was noted to have an innate instinct for wielding it, mastering it almost instantly with no aid from his teachers. Also, seemingly unique to him, Toshinori's mastery of this Quirk enabled him to morph himself into a towering, powerfully built man to hide his identity from society. All Might was so proficient with One For All that he was widely known as the world's most powerful person. During the peak of his abilities, he's been shown to deal with many threats at once in mere seconds effortlessly. Even more, after being grievously injured by All For One and transferring One For All to Izuku, All Might, using only residual ""embers"" of his former Quirk, could still achieve tremendous feats well-above everyone else . Despite no longer possessing One For All, Toshinori still has a connection with the Quirk. During the time he held One For All, a portion of his consciousness was imprinted into the Quirk itself, creating a vestige in One For All's mental landscape. This connection allows Toshinori to unconsciously provide the other vestiges information that he learns while also allowing Toshinori to sense the vestiges in One For All and Izuku through a kind of psychic link similar to All For One's connection with Tomura."

What color is Ochaco's hair?,auburn,Appearance,"Ochaco is a short girl with a slender yet curvy figure, fair skin, and auburn hair with eyes that match in color. She has perpetual pink blush marks on her cheeks, and her eyes are large and round with thick upper lashes, two more extended and more prominent ones on either side and fewer but more individually pronounced lower lashes. Her hair is above shoulder-length with short bangs hanging above her eyebrows, and the style is bobbed with two long strands framing her face. She has small, thick pads on her fingertips similar to the digits of an animal's paws; she uses these when activating and deactivating herQuirk. During her time in RozaryuMiddle School, she wore a plain white long sleevedseifukuwith a dark blue Kansai collar, cuffs, and skirt, a double white trim on the cuffs and Kansai collar, paired with a red scarf that is tied below, and sporting black tights and brown outdoor school shoes. She also wore a brown duffel coat and a pink scarf before entering theU.A. Entrance Exambuilding. At U.A, she wears the regular U.A. uniform for female students. It is topped with a gray dress jacket, two teal stripes, two pockets with folds, and two golden buttons. Underneath, she wears a white dress shirt, a red tie with a small, golden button, and a teal pleated skirt. She also wears brown dress shoes and black tights instead of the usual knee-high socks worn by most other female students. Her initial herocostumeconsists of a black, full-body suit with a pale pink design down the middle of her torso, topped with two black semi-spheres on her chest, two pink stripes starting at her midsection, a deep pink choker, and two-toned pink sleeves with cuffs. It also has matching pale and deep pink-colored accessories, including round gauntlets with handles, which are used to increase and decrease her blood pressure, chunky, knee-high boots with deep pink shock-absorbent soles and grey heels that have stiff springs in them to soften landings, and a two-piece belt with a round buckle. She sometimes wears matching headgear with a tinted visor as well, which is used to lessen stress on her ear canals. Her accessories are designed to press her acupuncture points, but the tightness of her costume was an error due to her not being specific enough in her request for its design .[6] Her costume is upgraded during theHero Work-Studies. There is only one pink stripe starting at her midsection and the belt around her waist has been minimized, no longer having a centre. Her arm gauntlets have been altered to include four raised openings capable of shooting grappling hooks, along with the handles now protruding, and her boots now have small holes on both sides. Her headgear is raised higher and no longer has a visor.[7] Eight years after the end of the Final War, Ochaco has become taller, while her face became more angular, and her eyes slightly narrower. The blush markings on her cheeks also are slowly fading as she gets older. Her figure became noticeably more mature and athletic, with her hair and bangs being slightly longer. Her hero costume has also changed as she now wears a pink mouth guard respirator similar to Izuku's Hero costume back at U.A., her two dots on her chest are now horizontal instead of vertical, and she has black fingerless gloves."
What is Ochaco's ditzy demeanor?,cheery,Personality,"Ochaco laughing. Other students have described Ochaco as ""the most laid-back girl"" in her class, being very bubbly and was once kind of an airhead sometimes. She is often incredibly blunt without being aware of it. Similar toIzuku Midoriya, Ochaco's reactions tend to be exaggerated and humorous: she often becomes amused at certain personality traits and quirks others exhibit, bursting into laughter at times, which she tries to suppress. Ochaco is a warm, cute, lively individual who thinks about everything positively, though she is objective enough to see flaws and virtues. She is generally empathetic and friendly to those she meets, and she will try to help or defend anyone who is kind to her or needs assistance. Ochaco is very good at reading people, understanding the reasons for Izuku andKatsuki Bakugo's rivalry, and being the first to notice when the usually collectedTsuyu Asuiwas upset. Her empathy and kindness are also seen in how well she gets along with her classmates. She is on good terms with everyone and is particularly close friends with several class members, including Izuku,Tenya Ida, Tsuyu, etc. Ochaco's fierce side. Despite her cheery and sometimes ditzy demeanor, Ochaco can take on an extremely determined, focused, and somewhat intimidating attitude when the situation demands and requires it. This side of her personality can surprise those who are used to her generally bubbly nature, and it tends to appear during competitive situations like theU.A. Sports Festival. While she is shown to be surprisingly strategic and even though she wasn't above making some impulsive or reckless decisions, however, she does subvert those moments and become much smarter over time. When it comes to her chosen path as a Hero, Ochaco is unwavering and dislikes being underestimated, even in the face of an overwhelming force. Ochaco's determination to earn money as a Hero so her parents can have easier lives. Coming from a poor household, Ochaco tends to become quickly excited or surprised over little things, even losing her composure when faced with luxury, to the point of comical fainting. Bonus materials have depicted her as frugal and occasionally stingy since she goes to extreme lengths to save money, including sleeping, so she doesn't waste oxygen or skipping meals to preserve food. Ochaco's parents are her main drive to becoming a hero, and she desires, above all else, to earn money to give them a comfortable life. She is brazenly honest about her priorities and doesn't hide her pursuit of heroism being in large part due to money, despite her embarrassment over admitting so. While money was a factor in her decision to become a hero, Ochaco dreamed of becoming one before realizing the extent of her parent's monetary struggles, as she admired their capacity to bring smiles to people's faces. Regarding heroism, Ochaco has shown more preference towards rescue, being a fan ofThirteenfor her expertise in the area. She is aware of her physical limitations and chooses the combat-oriented heroGunheadfor her internship to increase her fighting repertoire. Consequently, Ochaco developed a new sense of battle awareness and has become a more instinctive fighter. Ochaco having developed feelings for Izuku. Ochaco is also greatly inspired by her classmates, especially Izuku, whom she finds incredibly admirable for his strength and compassion. Ochaco has developed a crush on him due to this and their close friendship, resulting in her attempts to follow his example, for better or for worse. While he inspires her, Ochaco also acknowledges that heroism takes priority over her romantic feelings and does her best to continue to grow while keeping them in check. Izuku has also caused her to consider who protects heroes when in need since he continually throws himself into dangerous situations; this prominently shows how deeply Ochaco cares about him and others. Additionally, Ochaco's feelings for Izuku also result in her showing an occasional and subtle jealous side, which tends to be present when other girls get close to Izuku or converse highly with him. This jealousy is best displayed during his meetings and interactions withMei HatsumeandMelissa Shield, as well as being unsettled by his encounter with ""Camie"". Despite this, Ochaco is not spiteful and often tries to hide or dismiss this feeling whenever it appears. Ochaco's empathy can even extend toVillains, as while she remained apprehensive towardsHimiko Togafor having tried to kill her and Tsuyu, as well as for taunting her over her feelings for Izuku, she noticed that Himiko was visibly upset and crying when Ochaco refused to identify with her. This memory later comes back to her, and she realizes that Himiko is still a human despite all the horrible things she's done and acknowledges that she doesn't know her or what led her to become a villain. While she initially perceived this way of thinking to be wrong, it turns out that Izuku relates to her, with him having sensed the pain inTomura Shigaraki's heart and desire to find a way to help him, even though he knows that conflict is unavoidable. Ochaco notes that it's strange that they both can feel such things toward their enemies. During the Final War, Ochaco further shows her compassion by wanting to talk to Himiko about romance like she wanted, instead of trying to capture or kill her, making an attempt to reach out to the villain despite everything she's done. While she acknowledges that she can't erase Himiko's crimes, she swears that this time she will listen to her, going as far as to say that she would give Himiko her blood for the rest of her life, and saying that she was jealous of her ""perfect smile"". Ochaco's efforts eventually come to be successful as the villain agrees to talk with her, getting Himiko to stand down and ending her rampage for good. In the aftermath of the war, Ochaco was deeply affected by Himiko's death, being the sole witness of her passing after the villain transfused all her blood into Ochaco to save her life. Initially, Ochaco kept her pain hidden behind a smile and distanced herself from her classmates, not wanting to spoil everyone's happiness with the restoration efforts and society finally being returned to normal. When she was finally alone, Ochaco broke down and mourned for Himiko, being ridden by survivor's guilt and blaming herself for failing to reach Himiko sooner. After Izuku and the rest of Class A arrive to comfort her however, Ochaco was finally able to let go of her pain for failing to save Himiko, vowing to become better so that no one like Himiko gets left behind again. Eight years later, Ochaco has graduated from U.A. and has become a Pro Hero alongside her classmates. Keeping her vow to help others, she chooses to begin an expansion to Quirk counselling, touring elementary schools around Japan with her friends in order to provide better guidance and support to young children with their Quirks, proving hugely successful in her efforts. In lieu of her initial reason to become a Pro Hero, Ochaco frequently sends money to her parents, though they haven't touched any of it.[8] Despite Heroes now having more free time to spend for themselves, Ochaco still continued to put others before herself, insisting that her ""me time"" was all the time. However, still harboring feelings for Izuku, she would express a deep longing to spend more time together with him. After Izuku finds Ochaco alone to openly confess his mutual feelings for her, a vestige of Himiko lingering inside Ochaco encourages her to finally embrace her long-held feelings and live her life the way she wants to, prompting Ochaco to happily pursue the relationship with Izuku that she has always wanted."

Where did Eren live before the fall of Wall Maria?,Shiganshina District,Voice actor,"Eren Yeager was a former member of theSurvey Corps. He was the main protagonist ofAttack on Titan. He lived inShiganshina Districtwith his parents until thefall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed hismotherbeing eaten bya Titan.[33]This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards theTitansas he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.[34] Soon afterward, his father,Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to hisbasement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retakeWall Maria.[35]He then injected Eren with aTitan serum.[35] In the year847, Eren,Mikasa Ackerman, andArmin Arlertjoined the104th Training Corps. The three graduated with Eren ranking 5th best,[36]and they joined theSurvey Corpsfollowing thebattle of Trost District.[37] After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what theTitansare, as well as the history ofEldiaandMarley.

From his father, Eren inherited theAttackandFounding Titans.[39]After eatingLara Tyburduring theRaid on Liberio, he gained theWar Hammer Titanas well.[8]"
What was Eren's Founding Titan dubbed?,End Titan,Founding titan form,"Eren's Founding Titan, dubbed the End Titan[9], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. Initially, much of the Titan was shrouded by the steam from theWall Titans, but its sheer size was immediately noted, towering over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extended far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan.[46] The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the ""ribcage"" . The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge. Inside the Titan, Eren's head was disconnected from his torso; having been decapitated and rejoined by Ymir's power, it was connected by additional vertebrae to what presumably was his body. Some sinew supports his scalp. The Titan walked with its ""ribcage"", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the Rumbling.[47]"
Where was Eren born?,Shiganshina District,History,"Carla held a baby Eren Eren was born inShiganshina Districton March 30th, 835, in the southern region ofWall MariatoCarla YeagerandGrisha Yeager.[74]During his childhood he encountered a cryingArmin Arlert, and questioned why he never fought back against the neighborhood bullies, after hearing the boy's reasoning of refusing to run, he formed a friendship with him, and went on to defend from bullies.[75]Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world. Eren dreamed of joining theSurvey Corpsas soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world. Because of this dream, Eren and Armin were frequently regarded as heretics and harassed constantly by other children. When Eren was nine years old he accompanied his father on a house call to theAckerman family'shouse only to find both parents murdered and their daughterMikasamissing. Fearing the worst, Dr. Yeager instructed Eren to stay within the house while he fetched theMilitary Police. Eren, however, tracked thethe robbersto a small cabin in the forest behind the house.[76] Eren saved Mikasa from the robbers Thinking quickly, Eren feigned distress and claimed that he was lost. As one of the robbers approached Eren, he pulled out a hidden knife and stabbed the man. As the second man went after him with an axe, Eren charged him with a makeshift spear, piercing him in the shoulder. Once he was down, Eren proceeded to stab him to death in a wild frenzy while Mikasa looked on. As Eren untied her in the aftermath, he was caught off-guard by a third robber, who proceeded to strangle him. Eren urged Mikasa, who was frozen in fear, to fight back, warning her that they would both be killed if she did nothing. As Eren began to lose consciousness, Mikasa finally lost all inhibition and lunged at their attacker, stabbing him through the heart and killing him. Eren gave Mikasa his scarf When Dr. Yeager eventually returned with the MPs, he took Eren aside, scolding him angrily for his reckless behavior. While Eren was genuinely sorry for upsetting his father, he expressed no remorse whatsoever for killing the robbers. When Mikasa remarked that she was cold, Eren gave her the scarf from his own neck; and when Dr. Yeager invited Mikasa to live with their family from then on, Eren accepted her with no hesitation, tugging on her sleeve and shyly insisting that they return home.[77]"

Upon returning home, Mikasa reveals to Eren's mother that he wants to join the Survey Corps.

During the expedition, Eren is positioned at the center of theLong-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation, where it is the safest. However, per Erwin's orders, the knowledge of Eren's location within the formation is given only to a select few while the rest of the soldiers are given false information in order to misdirect any spies within their midst.[109][110] It soon becomes apparent that something is going wrong with the expedition. Squad Levi receives the news of the decimation of the right wing of the formation and see blackflaressignaling the presence of anAbnormalin close proximity, even though their position should be safest.[111]Soon after, the soldiers head toward aTitan Forest.

Eren and the rest of his team excluding Levi ride out of the forest firm in the belief that the Titan was captured and her human self apprehended.[115]The squad stands by and discuss Erwin's decision not to tell the soldiers about the plan while Levi consults with the commander. Eren wonders why is it that not even the elite soldiers were told about it, angering Oluo and Petra. Eld agrees with Eren, stating that Erwin must have had a reason. Remembering the odd question Erwin asked them when Sonny and Bean were killed, they realize that if they had answered correctly they would probably be trusted enough to be let in on the operation. Seeing a flare that indicates the Corps is retreating, the squad begins making their way out of the forest. They notice another signal flare fired in response, believing it to be Levi's. However, the mysterious soldier kills Gunther and then transforms into the Female Titan to resume her pursuit of Eren.[116]The remaining three team members tell Eren to go on while they attack the Female Titan.

Eren is initially shocked and angry at the accusation, refusing to believe that such a betrayal by one of his fellow trainees is possible. However, he is forced to acknowledge that the fighting style the Female Titan exhibited was exactly the same as Annie's. Reluctantly, he agrees to participate in the plan to capture her.[122] Eren, Mikasa, and Armin leave with Annie After Armin convinces Annie to join them in escorting Eren out ofStohess District, they lead her to the entrance to an underground tunnel. Eren begs her to join them and prove her innocence, but Annie refuses. Several soldiers ambush Annie[123]and she transforms, forcing Eren and his friends underground. Eren tries to go into Titan form by injuring himself but cannot due to shock and disbelief at Annie's betrayal, and his friendship with Annie making him unwilling to fight her.[124]As Mikasa and Armin depart to attempt to lead Annie away, Eren is reminded of the lives Annie took as the Female Titan as well as his vow to exterminate the Titans, allowing him to finally overcome his inhibitions and transform into his Titan form.[125] Even though Eren is in better control of his Titan and is equipped with knowledge of his opponent this time round, he is ultimately no match for Annie's superior fighting technique and hardening ability.

During one of his nightmares, he is startled awake with the realization thatDina, Grisha's first wife, was the Smiling Titan who had devoured his mother.[199] Hange and Levi release Eren and Mikasa from detention ten days early, informing them that their punishment was only to set an example to the public and that their help is needed to chart a new course for the Survey Corps in light of the new revelations about the outside world.[200] Eren remembers a way to use the Founding Titan Eren and the survivors attend a meeting with the rest of the military, including the Queen, to discuss the results of the expedition to Shiganshina and the information about the outside world recovered from Grisha's books. During the meeting, Eren realizes that the reason he was able to activate the Founding Titan's powers in the past was because he had physical contact with Dina Fritz, a member of the royal family. Eren chooses to withhold the revelation, reasoning that it is not the proper occasion to discuss such a controversial idea, especially if it involves having Historia turn into a Titan so he can control the Founding Titan.[201] The surviving members of the Survey Corps later attend a ceremony to be commemorated with medals for their bravery and success in Shiganshina. Before the ceremony begins,Floch Forsterconfronts Armin about the decision to save him over Erwin, angering Eren. An argument begins and Jean is forced to separate the two before it can escalate. Armin dejectedly agrees with Floch and Eren attempts to comfort him by reminding him of his dream to see the outside world, reminding him of all the sights they will see beyond the walls. Eren begins to remind Armin of the freedom that is waiting for them outside the walls, only to be given pause by the memory of his aunt Faye's grizzly death in Marley.[202] As the ceremony begins and the survivors receive their medals from Historia, Eren is lost in contemplation on the state of the outside world. He would be happy to give up his life to save Paradis from the threat of Marley, but he is unwilling to sacrifice anyone else's life to do so. Unsure of what to do next, Eren receives his medal from Historia and kisses her hand, receiving his father's memories of the night he killed the Reiss family.[203]Along with his father's memories of that night, Eren also receives memories from himself, sent to his father from the year 854 via the Attack Titan, effectively allowing him to see the future. The memories he receives reveal that he will, in four years' time, use the Founding Titan to unleash the Colossus Titans enclosed in Paradis's walls and use them to wipe out 80% of humanity outside the walls.[204][32]Eren is left horrified by the realization of what he will eventually do.[205] Eren solemnly stands in the ocean, pointing towards his enemies in Marley In roughly a year the Titan Guillotine vanquishes all Titans within Wall Maria, Shiganshina District is repopulated, and the Survey Corps hold their first expedition beyond the Walls in six years. The Survey Corps encounters a deformed Titan, who had been crawling towards the Wall, and Eren identifies the Titan as a former compatriot. The Survey Corps follows the deformed Titan's trail until they reach the edge ofParadis Island.[206] The Survey Corps go down to the beach front, dismounting their horses and taking off their boots. Armin is overjoyed by the ocean, but Eren solemnly notes that the other side of the ocean does not hold freedom as he used to believe.Enemiesexist on the other side of the ocean and Eren wonders if killing everybody across the ocean will bring the people of the Walls freedom.[207]"
Who does Eren ask if he has seen anything from Bertolt Hoover's memories that could help them?,Armin Arlert,Marley arc,"Eren explains how to bypass the vow to renounce war In the year 851, Eren works withHange Zoëand theSurvey Corpsto prepare forMarleyanaction againstParadis Island. Eventually, the first scouting ship arrives and Eren uses hisTitan formto pick it up and beach it on the shoreline.[208]At a meeting between members of theEldian Military, Eren supports the plan made byZeke Yeagerand reveals the encounter withDina Fritzthat caused him to activate the powers of theFounding Titan. He explains to Hange andLevi Ackermanthat he stayed quiet so thatHistoria Reiss's life would not be threatened.[209] Over the next three years, Marley sends a total of 32 scouting ships to Paradis Island,[210]all of which are destroyed by Eren andArmin Arlert.[211]While at a shooting range, Eren asks Armin if he has seen anything fromBertolt Hoover's memories that could help them. Armin ponders if it is possible for Paradis Island and Marley to resolve their misunderstandings diplomatically, but Eren brushes him off. Arguing that everyone still sees them as devils, he reaffirms his position that Paradis must strike the first blow in order to buy the island time.[212] Eren objects to Zeke's plan A year later, Eren attends a meeting betweenKiyomi Azumabito, from the nation ofHizuru, and the heads of Paradis on forming an alliance. When Eren hears that one of the three paths of action would involve Historia succeeding Zeke as theBeast Titan, he refuses to accept the plan.[213] In 853, while helping his friends assemble a train line, Eren is very disappointed to hear that Hizuru has been unable to find additional allies for them. Mentioning that Zeke only has two years left to live before he dies, Eren ponders who should take his Titan when he himself must pass it on. His friends offer themselves but he tells them that he wants them to live long lives.[214] Sometime later Floch allows Yelena to discreetly meet with Eren twice, where one was during a festival in Trost.[215]Yelena explains Zeke's plan to euthanize the Eldian race along with his plan to feed his spinal fluid to the Military's officers so that they will not be able to oppose his or Eren's movements. Yelena would later deny advising him to infiltrate Marley on his own.[216]Eren also learns from Yelena that Zeke wishes to speak with him in regards to his true intentions to free Paradis.[217] Eren shares his plan with Floch Following his meeting with Yelena, Eren meets with Floch privately and tells him that he wants them to pretend to cooperate with Zeke's plan. Floch asks what he actually wants to do while pretending to cooperate with Zeke and Eren tells Floch his plan to use the Founding Titan to kill everyone outside of Paradis. In another meeting, Eren, Yelena and Floch make plans to use a partial Rumbling to crushGlobal Allied Fleetas well asFort Salta.[218] Later, Eren meets withHistoriaand warns her that the Military Police are planning to feed Zeke to her, advising her to either fight or run to avoid becoming one of the Nine Titans. Historia refuses to oppose the MPs, explaining that she is willing to sacrifice herself if it will save Paradis. Eren reveals his plan to destroy the outside world to her, horrifying Historia. She reminds Eren that most of the people outside the Walls have nothing to do with Paradis but Eren insists that the only way to end the aggression towards Paradis is to wipe out anyone not strictly allied with them. Eren offers to erase Historia's memory with the Founding Titan if she cannot live with the guilt of knowing his plan. Historia rejects this but asks Eren about the possibility of her having a child with someone to delay eating Zeke.[219] Eren is one of several Survey Corpsmen who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. Although his companions are thrilled by the new experiences beyond the walls, Eren remains stoic, only commenting on things which he recognizes from his father's memories.[220]Eren explores Marley, agonizing over the knowledge that he will soon be responsible for killing everyone. RememberingKarl Fritz's desire for theEldianpeople to die out, Eren admits that such an outcome would lead to less deaths and finally rid the world of Titans, but he finds himself unable to accept such a fate. He finds aboybeing beaten by merchants for stealing and recognizes from his memories that he is going to save the boy. He attempts to convince himself not to and leave, knowing that he will ultimately kill the boy himself in theRumbling, but he is unable to stop himself from intervening. Eren tearfully gives his apology Eren returns the boy to his village, sullenly noting that he was unable to change the future. In tears, Eren apologizes to the boy for the genocide he will commit and confesses his feelings on his disappointment that humanity survived beyond the walls.[221]The boy returns to his tent just as Mikasa arrives to look for Eren. He brushes off her worried comments about his reckless behavior, instead commenting on the similarities between the boy's family and their experiences when Shiganshina was breached. Eren asks Mikasa why she displays so much concern for him and Mikasa, surprised, claims it is because they are family. They are joined by Jean, Armin, Connie and Sasha and the group is welcomed into the tent by the boy's family, spending the night drinking and carousing.[222] The soldiers sit in on a hearing between politicians to discuss Eldian mistreatment. When the speaker begins calling for the hatred being shown towards Eldians to be redirected towards the Eldians living on Paradis, Eren quietly leaves the meeting.[223] Eren asks Falco to mail a letter In 854, before the end of theMarley Mid-East War, Eren cuts off his own leg and gouges out one of his eyes to infiltrate the Marley military as an injured Eldian soldier.[224]He returns toLiberioand is sent to the hospital along with the other wounded and traumatized Eldian soldiers. After being knocked to the floor by a terrified soldier, he is helped up byFalco Gricewho points out that his armband is on the wrong arm.[225] Using the alias ofKruger, Eren is visited by Falco while he is in the hospital. He admits to Falco that he has been faking amnesia so that he will not be discharged[226]and asks the boy to send a letter for him from outside of the internment zone so that the hospital will not figure out that he is faking his illness. Eren says the letter is to his family, to let them know he is all right.[227] During his stay in Liberio, Eren meets with Zeke and learns about the true nature behind theAckerman clanlineage.[228]Eren asks Zeke if Mikasa's headaches are something every Ackerman experiences and Zeke claims to have never heard of such symptoms. Zeke tells Eren that he does not believe that Ackermans truly have ingrained behaviors toward a host, instead suggesting that Mikasa simply likes Eren. Eren replies that he only has 4 years left to live, and wishes for his friends to live longer.[229]Zeke asks if Eren would go through with his plan set to save theSubjects of Ymirby euthanizing them.[230]Eren claims that their father was mistaken and agrees with Zeke's earlier claim that Grisha had brainwashed him into following his plan. Eren laments that there would be no suffering had the Eldians never been born and agrees to work with Zeke.[231] Eren meets his grandfather Eren continues to receive visits from Falco, who delivers more of his letters. During this time, Eren learns that Reiner is still alive and is Falco's superior.[232]After Falco leaves, one of the hospital's doctors sits down next to Eren and introduces himself asYeager. The two talk about Falco, and Yeager asks Eren to stop using Falco to run errands, so that there would be no risk of undoing the hard work that had returned peace to theGrice family. Eren asks Yeager if he has any regrets about his family, causing the doctor to have a mental breakdown.[233] Eren reunites with Reiner after four years Just before the start of theTybur festival, Eren leaves the hospital and takes up residence in a building near the stageWilly Tyburwill be performing a play on. En route, he runs into Falco and asks the boy to bring Reiner to him.[234]Upon Reiner's arrival, he asks Eren why he is in Marley, and Eren responds that he is there for the same reason as Reiner; he has no choice. Revealing that he has already slit his hand in preparation to transform if need be, Eren insists that Reiner sit with him to listen to the play.[235] Eren regenerates his leg and apologizes to Falco for deceiving him, admitting that the letters Falco sent were not to his family but to his allies stationed in Marley. Overhearing Willy claim that he is a threat to Marley's peace, Eren admits that he is indeed the ""bad guy,"" but argues that the Warriors were also the bad guys when they invaded Wall Maria. Eren asks why Reiner and the others broke the wall[236]and Reiner says that it was so they could capture the Founder and save the world. Reiner asks if Eren has come to kill him and Eren admits that he has seen that there are both good and evil people in Marley. He admits that he understands the turmoil Reiner went through, causing the latter to break down and ask that Eren kill him.[237] Eren kills Willy Tybur and declares war against Marley Helping Reiner to his feet, Eren says that he now understands that they are the same and declares that he will continue until he wipes out his enemy. Transforming into theAttack Titan, Eren breaks out of the building and kills Willy.[238]He flings himself on top of the military high command in the crowd, killing them. As Eren rampages, theWar Hammer Titanemerges and he attacks it before it can fully transform. It appears he has the upper hand until a hardened pillar impales him.[239] The War Hammer Titan finishes its formation and constructs a hammer to fight Eren. Eren breaks the pillar trapping his Titan only to find the ground covered in barbed spikes, preventing him from lifting his feet. Eren hardens his Titan's hands in an attempt to block the War Hammer's next strike, but fails, and the Attack Titan's head is sheered away.[240]Eren emerges from his Titan's nape and calls for Mikasa, who attacks the War Hammer at the same time the rest of the Survey Corps attack the Marleyan military.[241] Mikasa questions Eren about his killing of civilians The War Hammer Titan survives Mikasa's attack and fires a pike of its hardened skin towards them. Mikasa grabs Eren and flees from the Attack Titan's body, barely evading the pike. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract it long enough for him to enact it.[242]As Mikasa fights the War Hammer Titan, Eren remembers that the Titan's body materialized from its feet rather than its nape and deduces that its human body is located somewhere underground. Transforming back into the Attack Titan, he sees a hole in the street from where a long cable of flesh comes out, attached to the War Hammer Titan. Eren reaches in and grabs the crystallized body ofLara Tybur, severing her connection and disabling the War Hammer.[243] Eren about to eat Lara Tybur, as Galliard goes to attack him As Eren is about to eat the War Hammer, theJaw Titanappears behind him and bites Eren's neck. With Levi's help, Eren smashes the Titan against the building and tries to take it off his back, but it manages to flee. Because of the distraction Eren fails to notice that the War Hammer has been generating a new Titan body and he is impaled in a tree-like structure made of hardened skin.[244]Trapped, Eren breaks his hand free and attempts to consume the War Hammer's user once more. When he bites the crystal, he breaks his Titan's jaw on the hardened surface. Eren exits trapped Titan form and immediately transforms once again.[245]The Jaw Titan runs across the plaza to assault Eren,[246]and resorts to using its claws to strike him. During the attack, Eren blocks a slash from the Titan using Lara Tybur's crystal. Noticing that the attack successfully produced cracks in the crystal, Eren devises a plan to use the Jaw Titan to get to Lara. Eren receives the powers of the War Hammer Titan Mikasa cripples the Jaw Titan's legs in a surprise attack, allowing Eren grabs it and disables it before jamming the crystal into its mouth and using its jaws to break through. He successfully kills Lara Tybur, consuming the fluids from her body and giving himself the powers of the War Hammer Titan.[247]He moves to finish off the Jaw Titan but is stopped by the arrival of an incomplete Armored Titan. Eren punches Reiner, but Reiner manages to rescue the Jaw Titan. Eren emerges from his Titan, proclaiming that their mission is done, leading Mikasa to ask that they go back home. As they grapple up to the airship, Eren promises Reiner that they will meet again.[248] Once on the airship Eren is met by Levi, who kicks him and orders that he be restrained. Eren does not resist, but insists that nothing in his letter was wrong.[249]Eren waits in a room with Zeke and Yelena aboard the airship when Jean arrives with Falco and Gabi, saying that Gabi shot Sasha.Hangeberates Eren for having forced the Survey Corps to accommodate his plans and abusing their trust. Eren is unrepentant, saying that the destruction of the Marleyan military leadership has bought them time. When Connie comes in to announce that Sasha has died, Eren asks about her final words. Hearing that it was ""meat,"" Eren begins to laugh.[250] After returning to Paradis, Eren is taken to a cell underground in accordance with his arrest. As he cleans himself up, Eren mutters that Paradis needs to continue fighting.[251]"
"Who does Eren speak to in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully?",Hange,War for paradis arc,"Eren grabs and assaults Hange Hange arrives and notes that Eren was talking to himself before attempting to make small talk with him. Eren demands to know what Hange visited him for[252]and Hange chastises Eren for inflaming the rest of the world against Paradis with his attack. Eren reveals that he stole the power of the War Hammer Titan in Liberio and claims that he can free himself any time. Grabbing Hange through the bars of his cell, Eren demands to know what Hange can do to him, and asks if there is any other way for them to act.[253] Eren frees himself At roughly the same time Darius Zackly is killed by a bomb in his office, Eren uses his Titan abilities to escape from his cell. He seals up his exit route with hardened skin to prevent his captors from following him.[254]After escaping, Eren meets up with theYeagerists, a group consisting of Floch and the other recruits who sided with him during his incarceration. Eren declares that they need to locate Zeke.[255] Eren hears the proposal put forth by Commander Pixis and refuses the offer. He instructs his followers not to negotiate with the Military. He then learns fromoneof his followers that Hange and his friends are gathered at a nearby restaurant. Arriving at the restaurant, he instructs Floch to restrain and move them while he speak to Mikasa, Armin, and Gabi.[43]Eren speaks to them in a private room, claiming to want to solve things peacefully. Armin asks if Zeke and Yelena have convinced him to join their side, but Eren brushes him off and claims that everything he has done has been his desire.[256]Mikasa insists he is being controlled but Eren ignores her. Eren beats up Armin Eren reveals to Armin that he is aware of the latter's frequent trips to visit Annie and suggests he is being unknowingly influenced by the memories Bertolt had of her.[257]When Mikasa goes to defend Armin, Eren reveals that he has learned about her family lineage from Zeke and claims that the only reason she has stayed by his side is due to her instincts to protect her host. He explains that Ackermans, once awakened, often suffer unexpected headaches due to their true self fighting the urge to protect their recognized host and claims the true Mikasa died the day he saved her from her kidnappers. Eren proclaims that he has always hated people like Mikasa: obedient slaves that do nothing but follow orders.[258]Armin attacks Eren, but his point is proven when Mikasa instinctively grabs Armin and slams him into the table. Armin manages to punch him anyway and Eren responds by beating Armin into submission.[259]He orders that they and Gabi be taken away, but becomes briefly enraged when Armin calls him a slave.[260] Eren learns Pieck wishes to save the Eldians Later, Eren takes two soldiers and visits Gabi in her holding cell[261]and offers to help her save Falco in exchange for her issuing a call for help to Marley to root out any possible spies. Eren is caught by surprise whenoneof the soldiers aims a pistol at him after stabbing the other in the throat.[262]He is unfazed by Pieck's threat of shooting him, reminding her that her mission is to presumably take him alive. However, Pieck claims that she wishes to join him.[263]Not trusting her intentions, Eren pricks his finger and orders her to prove herself to him and the Yeagerists. When Pieck offers to reveal where her fellow infiltrators are, Eren heals his finger and orders Pieck and Gabi to be handcuffed together.[264] Eren transforms after being ambushed by Galliard On the roof, he prepares to injure himself again and orders Pieck to reveal her fellow infiltrators. She points at Eren himself, and the Jaw Titan suddenly attacks Eren, taking both of his legs. Transforming, Eren spots a fleet of Marleyan airships approaching their location.[265]Eren trades several blows with the Jaw Titan before it retreats. Eren is perplexed at Marley's decision to launch a counterattack so soon after the raid on Liberio. Despite Yelena pleading with him to flee underground, Eren decides to fight Marley on his own.[266]Noticing Reiner transforming into the Armored Titan while parachuting from an airship, Eren deduces that was responsible for Marley's quick response to the Liberio attack and the two proceed to engage each other.[267] Eren impales the Armored and Jaw Titan Eren initially overpowers Reiner, using his superior fighting skills and hardening to break through Reiner's armor plating. Reiner manages to briefly stun Eren and the Jaw Titan attempts to ambush him from behind but Eren uses the War Hammer Titan's abilities to repel them.[268]Eren is shot in the head with a round from Marley's anti-Titan artillery, leaving his motor skills severely impaired. Eren is able to generate more spikes to stop the Jaw Titan's attacks but is shot in the head a second time.[269]Stunned, Eren is unable to dodge Reiner's attack and is skewered by one of the spikes generated from the ground. Despite this, he manages to generate a third set of spikes to impale Reiner once more, and smacks the Jaw Titan out of the air when it tries to attack him from behind. Eren tries to hold off Reiner and manages rip through the latter's jaw but Reiner continues to incapacitate Eren until he is saved by a projectile thrown by Zeke from atop the Wall.[270] Eren is decapitated With Zeke's arrival, Eren begins trying to reach him in hopes of activating the powers of the Founding Titan while Zeke keeps Marley's Warriors at bay.[271]As he grows closer to Zeke's position, Eren is set upon by the Jaw Titan once again but makes short work of him, repeatedly slamming down on the Titan's head and nape. However, this distracts him long enough for another anti-Titan artillery round to be fired into his head again and for Reiner to catch up to him and begin grappling with him. The fighting is momentarily interrupted by the arrival of Colt and Falco who reveal that Falco has accidentally ingested Zeke's spinal fluid. Zeke is undeterred and screams, ordering a transformed Falco to attack Reiner. Falco's Pure Titan does not prove to be enough to force Reiner to let go of Eren, so Eren exits his Titan and begins running to Zeke on foot. However, before he can reach his brother Eren is decapitated by a blast from an anti-Titan artillery rifle.[272] As his head lands in his brother's hand, Eren suddenly finds himself standing before a pillar of light in an unknown land. He is greeted by a chained Zeke, who informs Eren that they are standing in the Coordinate.[273]Zeke explains that he was able to bring the two of them into the unknown land by touching Eren's head in the moments before he could die. They have finally unlocked the Founding Titan's power.[274] Eren betrays Zeke by refusing to euthanize the Eldians Eren notices ayoung girlapproaching them and Zeke informs him that the girl is Ymir Fritz. Zeke encourages him to take control of Ymir and activate their plan to euthanize all Eldians, but Eren inquires as to why he is sitting there in chains. Zeke explains that the chains are Karl Fritz's vow, keeping anyone with royal blood from acting freely and again asks Eren to begin their plan. However, Eren reveals that he has no intention of following Zeke's plan and was only using him to obtain the Founder's power.[275]Eren approaches Ymir and requests he be given control of her power, only to be ignored.[276]To Eren's horror, Zeke reveals that during his time waiting for Eren to arrive in the unknown land he discovered a way to erase Karl Fritz's vow, and that Ymir will only obey people with royal blood. Zeke chains Eren in place, explaining that he has been brainwashed by Grisha.[277]Despite Eren's protests, Zeke promises to free him and begins showing him memories from Grisha's life.[278] Zeke systematically takes Eren through different moments in Grisha's life on Paradis, detailing how Grisha covertly used his occupation as a doctor to gain information on the royal family in spite of the risk posed to his new family. Eren is largely unfazed by the memories, only surprised to learn that Grisha located the Reiss chapel years before he actually attacked the family and that he still thought of Zeke years after arriving to Paradis. While Zeke is reeling at the revelation that their father still cared for him, Eren moves along to the next memory.[279]As Eren and Zeke continue through Grisha's memories, Zeke asks why Eren betrayed him if he was not brainwashed by Grisha. Eren responds that he has always believed in stealing the freedom of anyone who opposes his own.[280]Eren and Zeke then go to the memory of Grisha writing about how humanity has not perished beyond the walls, and are both caught off guard when Grisha is able to see Zeke for a brief moment. Eren influences his father to kill the Reiss family Eren and Zeke travel to Grisha's memory of the day he stole the Founding Titan from the Reiss family. As he observes the exchange between his father and Frieda Reiss, Eren becomes increasingly agitated by Frieda's claims that the Eldians must take on the world's wrath for the sins of their ancestors.[281]Despite Grisha's declaration that he will steal the Founding Titan from the Reiss family, Eren is disappointed and enraged to see that his father cannot bring himself to carry out his mission. To spur his father forward, Eren reminds Grisha of his fellow Restorationists and Faye, ordering him to finish what he has started.[282] Eren escapes and rushes to get to Ymir Zeke returns the two brothers to the present, despite Eren's objection that they have yet to see Grisha's final memories. Eren reveals that four years prior he had been given a glimpse of his own memories of the future while peering into Grisha's memories and Zeke, horrified, orders Ymir to sterilize the Subjects of Ymir. Desperate to stop Zeke's plan, Eren is able to escape his chains by severing his thumbs against the shackles and races to try to stop Ymir.[283]He embraces her and begs that she give him her power so that he can end the world, promising that he will not force her to help him. He recognizes that she is neither a slave nor a deity, she is only a human being and she has the right to choose if she wants to remain in the Coordinate forever or help him end it all. As Zeke desperately tries to stop him, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who led him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2,000 years for him to arrive.[284] Eren declares his intention to destroy the world In Shiganshina, Eren's body transforms into the Founding Titan as Shiganshina's walls begin to crumble.[285]He then uses the Founder's power to telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[286]He reveals that the hardening of the Walls has come undone, and declares that theWall Titanswill destroy all life outside the island.[67] Eren and his Titans arrive at Marley's coast to find it guarded by the Global Allied Fleet. However, the fleet proves to be ineffective against Eren's Colossus Titans and is immediately wiped out. The land artillery onMarleyis also unsuccessful in stopping the advancing Titans, causing the soldiers to retreat to higher ground. As his Titans begin the destruction of Marley, Eren remembers the death ofhis motherand reiterates his desire to destroy every last one of his enemies in the world.[287] While he is advancing, Eren summons each of his friends and former enemies to speak with him in Paths individually. He reveals to each of them his true intentions, to become a threat to the entire world so that they can kill him and earn the favor of the nations outside of Paradis. He also reveals that his death will permanently destroy the Power of the Titans, causing all Eldians trapped as Pure Titans, including Connie's mother, to return to their human forms.[288] When Eren speaks with Armin he tries to apologize for the way he treated him at Niccolo's restaurant, but Armin says that he should be more worried about apologizing to Mikasa. Armin worries that the world will try to retaliate for what Eren did, but Eren reveals that he succeeded in wiping out 80% of the world's population before he was stopped. The nations will not be able to launch any meaningful counterattacks for the foreseeable future. Armin tries to insist that there was a better way but Eren ignores his protests and asks Armin to follow him. Eren takes Armin to a volcano to show him the ""liquid fire"" that he read about as a child, lava. Eren reveals to Armin that he has come to understand that the reason Ymir Fritz remained servile to the royal family even centuries after her original master's death is because she genuinely loved him, despite the abuses she suffered by him. Although he does not understand the woman fully, he knows that it was Mikasa who managed to free her from her servitude. Eren claims to not know why Mikasa is important to Ymir, only that every action he has taken since he received his future memories has been done in the service of Mikasa freeing Ymir. Eren reveals he had a hand in his mother's death As he reflects on everything he has done, Eren confesses to Armin that he can no longer think clearly, as the combination of past and future memories in his head have rendered him unable to distinguish what is past, present, and future. His warped perspective of time has caused him to take actions to ensure history should play out the way he remembers it, even using his powers to influence time in the past and send Dina Fritz's Titan away from Bertolt, which lead her to eat his mother. Armin takes Eren to see the ocean and asks him if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know and Armin punches him, enraged at the way he has been treating Mikasa. Eren reveals his true feelings about Mikasa Armin begins ridiculing Eren, joking that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, and Eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want Mikasa to love anyone but him. After composing himself, Eren confesses that he does not want to die. Armin tries to convince him that he can keep living, but Eren reminds him that the world will never forgive what he has done. As a ruined landscape of trampled corpses appears before them, Eren confesses that he would have continued Rumbling even if his friends had not tried to stop him. Armin demands to know why, but Eren claims he does not know. Eren tells Armin that he will be temporarily erasing his memories until his death and Armin gives him a seashell, thanking him for everything he has done for Paradis's sake. The two embrace and Eren tells Armin that he is confident Armin will be able to save humanity after his death.[289] As he approaches Fort Salta, Eren summons Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Connie, Levi, Reiner, and Pieck into the Paths to speak to them. His former comrades beg him to stop the Rumbling, but Eren tells them that he has no intention of stopping. He explains that he will take all of the world's freedom so he can achieve his own, but he promises not to deny the alliance's freedom to thwart his plans. However, Eren reinforces his intent to destroy the world, refusing to negotiate on any terms and stating that the only thing to stop his advance would be his death.[290] Eren engages his comrades Marleyan airships are launched from Fort Salta in an attempt to stop Eren's advance[291]and begin dropping bombs on his Titan. In response, Eren dispatches the Beast Titan to shoot them down. Eren and the Beast make quick work of the airships, but his comrades arrive and manage to evade the Beast Titan's projectiles long enough to reach him and engage him directly.[292]As his friends attempt to reach his nape to destroy it, Eren and Ymir begin generating more Titans on his back to defend him.[293]Despite this, the soldiers eventually manage to reach Eren's nape and blow it up, severing his Titan's head from its body. Armin then transforms atop his Titan in an attempt to kill him.[294] Eren's last moments This proves to be ineffective, and Eren's head transforms again into a new Colossus form to continue its march. He is met by Armin, who chooses to engage him in a hand-to-hand fight with his Colossus Titan form. As Mikasa is approaching Eren to attack him, he brings her to a Paths life in which they run away together while in Marley and live out the rest of their lives together in peace and isolation. After spending some time together in that life, Eren asks Mikasa to forget him after his death.[295]In the real world, Armin manages to immobilize Eren long enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him by severing his head from the spine, before kissing him goodbye.[296] Following his death, Mikasa and Armin decide to bury Eren's head at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under outside of Shiganshina District, and a small grave is made there for Eren, which Mikasa continues to visit years later.[297]"

He trained extensively in hand-to-hand grappling.,(B).,Martial arts,"Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat. After additional training with Reiner and Annie, Eren's prowess and skill set diversified, including the use of punches, throws, grappling and submission locks.[298]He had the best scores for hand-to-hand combat of the entire 104th graduate squad. While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form."
What was Eren Yeager's most significant use of maneuvering equipment?,cut Bertolt Hoover out of the Colossus Titan's nape,Vertical maneuvering equipment,"Though having little talent, through intense training and effort he managed to gain a considerable amount of skill with theequipment. Even so, Eren was not completely lacking in natural aptitude. While using the damaged equipment, he had managed to stay upright for a short amount of time, which the instructor, Keith Shadis, said was an incredible feat, and balanced with ease when using proper gear.[299]The fact he graduated as the 5th best of the 104th graduate squad, even before Jean Kirstein, who was top of the class in mobility with the gear, implied that he had considerable combat skill with the maneuvering equipment. Though Eren was not shown using the equipment as often as other members of the Survey Corps, he was able to hold his own against the Colossus Titan until the Titan disappeared, almost reaching the nape twice. He was even capable of killing a Titan on his own not too long after joining the Survey Corps. His most significant use of maneuvering equipment was shown during the Battle of Shiganshina, where he was able to use it to cut Bertolt Hoover out of the Colossus Titan's nape while he was distracted by his hardened Titan form, despite being exhausted. Eren Yeager's statistics as of year 850[300]:"
What did Grisha inject Eren with after giving him the key to the basement?,aserum,Attack titan,"After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected a struggling Eren with aserum, which transformed him into a 4 meter Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a skinny body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of theFounding TitanandAttack Titan. Years later, during the first Battle of Trost, Eren was eaten alive by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. The sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into his Titan form for the first time.[301] In this form, Eren was a 15 meter tall Titan, with shoulder-length black hair, pointed ears, a long nose, and a gaping, skeleton-like maw lacking lips. Unlike most other Titans, his Titan form was considerably more muscular and defined; making him much stronger than even similar-sized Titans while his intelligence and military training, allowed him to out-maneuver and dispatch entire groups of Titans with ease. A transformation took a heavy toll on Eren's body and required large amounts of stamina. As a result, he had displayed several symptoms when he over-exerted himself such as a nosebleed, pale skin, and labored breathing. In some cases, Eren was rendered unconscious for a short period of time after a Titan transformation. Initially, Eren had no control over his actions when he first transformed into a Titan and was unable to remember any actions that occurred during the first Battle of Trost. He was in a “dream-like state” and failed to remember how to transform in the first place. However, Eren recalled fragmented memories of his father by seeing the key to the basement of his old home and was able to successfully transform to protect Armin and Mikasa from certain death. It had been shown that with more transformations, Eren retained more of his intelligence, being able to form rational thoughts. At the beginning, during the second Battle of Trost, Eren in his Titan form attacked Mikasa but ultimately plugged the hole in Trost's gate after Armin forced him to wake up. His Titan form, combined with his growing experience and his hand-to-hand combat skills, allowed him to kill over 20 Titans in his first transformation and later manage to overpower and nearly kill theArmored Titan.[302] Eren, like all others with the power of the Titans, must physically harm himself in order to transform into his Titan form. However, lack of a determined goal and resolution for it inhibit his ability to transform as shown when he could not transform at first to confront Annie Leonhart. Within Titan transformations, he had displayed the ability to partially transform, as shown when he protected Mikasa and Armin from a cannonball by forming the upper torso skeleton, complete with arms and a skull with some muscle tissue. Eren hardening his fists"
How many years after his first use of the Founding Titan was Eren able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power?,Four,Founding titan,"With the power of the Founding Titan thatGrisha Yeagerstole from theReiss family, Eren possessed the ability to control nearby Titans, causing them to relentlessly attack his chosen target. However, this ability could only be used while Eren is in contact with a Titan ofroyal blood. The first time he used it was entirely by accident, by touching the palm ofDina Fritz's Titan, causing nearby Titans to attack and devour her, and setting the same Titans upon Bertolt and Reiner. While it is shown that others with the power of the Titans can sense the activation of his power, it is unknown whether it is possible to use it to influence or control other human-controlled Titans.[309] Possession of the Founding Titan was the reason many groups had expressed an interest in Eren, includingMarley'sWarriorsin theirParadis Island Operation, and Rod Reiss, the former patriarch of the Reiss family. Four years after his first, accidental use of it, Eren was finally able to unlock the full capabilities of the Founding Titan after convincing the soul of Ymir Fritz to lend him her power, giving him access to all of the Founder's powers and turning him into the ""End Titan"". With the full power of the Founder, Eren was able to control all of the Wall Titans, create a unique Titan body that towered over all of them, and could telepathically communicate with all of the Subjects of Ymir.[286]"

Who is Mikasa Ackerman?,"one of the two deuteragonists of the series, along with Armin Arlert",Voice actor,"Mikasa Ackerman is one of the two deuteragonists of the series, along withArmin Arlert. Afterherparentswere murdered byhuman traffickers, Mikasa was rescued byEren Yeagerand lived with him and his parents,GrishaandCarla, before thefall of Wall Maria. She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed onParadis Island, thereby related to theAzumabito family, and holds significant political power inHizuru.[12] Though she desires only to live a peaceful life, Mikasa entered into themilitary—where she is considered the best soldier among the104th Training Corps. She later enlists in theSurvey Corpsto follow and protect Eren, becoming one of its greatest assets. She is currently serving as an officer in the Corps."
What is Mikasa's relationship to her friends and caretakers?,cares deeply,Personality,"Before living with the Yeager family, Mikasa appeared to be a cheerful, outgoing, and gentle child. Her innocence allowed her to push anxious thoughts to the back of her mind, continuing to live with her parents and loved ones happily. Growing up, Mikasa has become emotionally withdrawn and noticeably dangerous, sometimes intimidating her enemies or even her comrades. She is quite stoic and level headed, rarely seen to lose her cool or be at a loss of what to do, no matter how bleak the situation seems to be. Her will is remarkably strong, demonstrated when she managed to remain so outwardly calm when Eren was presumed dead; only Armin could tell that she was battling with the pain of losing him.[17] Mikasa cares deeply for her friends and caretakers, seeing them as the last remnants of a family she cannot afford to lose.[18]She also appears to have a soft spot for children, evidenced by her bowing to ayoung girlshe saved and her instantly saving aMarleyan soldier, despite the latter having earlier killedone of her comrades. Mikasa is not completely immune to the effects of her emotions, however: Her strong feelings for her beloved ones, particularly when they are in harm's way, does at times cloud her judgment in fury—sometimes to the endangerment of herself and others.[19]A notable example was when Mikasa briefly gave in to her grief over Eren's apparent demise and lost the will to live, forgetting her responsibility for the lives of the soldiers she took upon herself to lead in the process. However, she was reawakened by her memories of Eren and a made decision to never give up again, as her memories would die with her. Mikasa's protective attitude towards Eren From an early age, Mikasa was unusually perceptive, aware of the harshness of nature by witnessing the manner in which predators hunt and kill weaker prey. Her peace was shattered when a band of criminals brutally murdered her parents before her eyes in a failed kidnapping attempt, only saving herself and her rescuer when she managed to abandon all inhibition and hesitation to kill one of herassailants.[20]Following this traumatic event, Mikasa would gain a generally cynical outlook on life and accept the world as a cruel place where only those who are strong are able to survive.[21]Her determination to protect her beloved ones as much as possible has contributed greatly to her phenomenal skills as a soldier. Though being among the best of the best, she remains humble and refrains from putting on airs or displaying arrogance. Mikasa has a strong sense of right and wrong, doing everything she can to make her most impulsive friends follow what she thinks is the right track.[22]In spite of this, she is well aware that she cannot always sway them in decisions and makes it a point to follow them wherever they go, just so that she can be around to help out when trouble arises.[23]The sole reason she enlisted in the military and joined the Survey Corps after her graduation was to keep an eye on Eren, despite the fact that she truly wished to live out the rest of her days in relative peace within theWallsalongside him. Mikasa's bond with Eren is undoubtedly her most important relationship and the one that defines her. Her personality as a teenager was very much influenced by Eren, who told her she stood no chance of survival if she did not fight for it.[24]His words continued to stay with her, and she automatically recalled them to spur her on when she was close to death. Mikasa wears the black scarf Eren gave her when they first met, holding on to it as a source of strength and comfort when she is upset.[25]She had openly wept tears of relief at his safety and developed vengeful grudges towards those who harm him, from enemies to her ownsuperiors. She blushed when it was insinuated she and Eren were lovers;[26]furthermore, after he insulted her and stated that he had always hated her, she was visibly hurt and eventually left behind the scarf he had given her.[27] While she would regain the scarf from Louise,[28]Mikasa would not wear it again until moments before confronting Eren following his initiation of theRumbling.[29]Mikasa's sacrifice of a life with her beloved Eren and choosing to defy and kill him is ultimately the reasonYmir Fritzwas freed and the Titans vanishing from the world.[30]Mikasa grieves for Eren as she visits his grave,[14]and would continue to regularly visit it with her new family for several decades until passing away of old age while wearing the scarf.[31]"
How old was Mikasa when Eren Yeager arrived with members of the Military Police Brigade?,9 years old,History,"Mikasa was born to anAsian mother, and herfatherwas a member of theAckerman clan.[32]She lived peacefully with her parents in the farmlands of Wall Maria, helping them since a young age. Mikasa underwent a painful scarring ritual from her mother, who cut into her skin the mark of theirfamily.[33] Eren gave Mikasa his scarf Being the last of their race made her mother and Mikasa high value targets to robbers. When she was only 9 years old, a group of traffickers killed her parents and attempted to kidnap her for the purpose of selling her in the human-trading market of the Capital'sUnderground.[32]Frightened and shocked, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager, the son of her family's doctor. He tricked and killed two of the kidnappers, but he was overwhelmed by the third trafficker and on the verge of being strangled. Eren desperately urged Mikasa to fight to win, who came to realize that the world can be callous and merciless before dispatching the robber from behind, who was trying to kill him. When Grisha Yeager arrived with members of theMilitary Police Brigade, Mikasa was given the scarf by Eren and accepted into his family. This event awakened the fighting instincts and perfect self-control that runs in the Ackerman clan.[34]Mikasa then went to live with Eren's family until theFall of Wall Maria.[35]"

She is among the others who learn of Krista's real name beingHistoria.[102]After they reach the top of the Wall, Mikasa is outraged when she overhears Reiner confessing that he and Bertolt were the Titans responsible for the attack on Wall Maria and wanted Eren to join them. She takes them by surprise, attacking them with her swords and tells Eren to run. However, she fails to kill them as Reiner stops her from doing so, transforming afterward and attempting to kidnap Eren.[103]While Eren transforms, and engages in battle with Reiner, Mikasa faces her own troubles and regrets for not cutting off both his and Bertolt's heads when she had the chance.[104]During the fight with Reiner, she sees Eren in trouble and tries to fight him off. However due to the thickness of the armor, Mikasa has a hard time slicing the nape of Reiner's neck.[105]Eventually, Armin sees a weak link in Reiner's line of defense in which his armor is breaking and gives Mikasa extra blades to replace her own. Taking advantage of the information, she cuts him at the back of the knee caps. However, Bertolt manages to save Reiner thanks to his abilities of the Colossus Titan, knocking out most of the soldiers in the process.[106] Later, Mikasa along with Hange and others from the Survey Corps are injured from the heat blast from Bertolt's Titan form. While Armin helps them recover, he gives Mikasa the news that she was dreading to hear: Eren along withYmirwas kidnapped by both Reiner and Bertolt.[107]Taking the scarf that he gave her, Mikasa covers her face with it and asks why Eren always runs off on them like that. She feels like she has failed in keeping her promise to Eren'smotherto always protect him and weeps.[108]As Armin tries to console her,Hannesarrives to give out rations to the Legion. It was him who reminds her that despite him running off the way he does and often losing fights, he never gives up on them. Even though the odds are stacked against him and he is unwilling to admit it, Hannes always knew that Eren relied on both Mikasa and Armin when he needed them. His words and his assistance reinvigorated them and are more determined to rescue Eren. Mikasa lowers her scarf and begins eating.[109] She joins the joint military operation to rescue Eren and heads to the forest of giant trees where they hope to find Reiner, Bertolt, and their captives. Once they arrive she joins Hannes and a number of her fellow soldiers in searching the inside of the forest where they encounter Ymir in her Titan form. Ymir kidnaps Historia and flees while Mikasa and the others chase after her. At the forest's edge, Reiner transforms into the Armored Titan. Ymir jumps on his back and Bertolt, carrying an unconscious Eren, rides on his shoulder.[110] Mikasa strikes Ymir The soldiers follow the group on horseback and try to free Eren from Bertholdt, but Ymir interferes with their attempts. Realizing that armor was protecting Reiner's joints this time, she instead targetsYmirand slashes into her face.[111]Historia jumps in the way, saying that Ymir does not have a choice but to help Reiner and Bertolt. Fearing that Ymir will be killed, Historia convinces her to back down, leaving the rest of the 104th free to try talking Bertolt into letting Eren go, though Mikasa is considerably less forgiving than the others.[112]Jean and Connie try to speak to Bertolt and coax him into surrendering, but Mikasa coldly states that their reasons do not matter.[113]She is momentarily stayed by Bertolt's apologies for what he and Reiner have done,[114]but when she requests again that Eren be returned, Bertolt refuses. Before the group can argue further,Hannesshouts a warning to them that a huge group of Titans is being led straight towards them byErwin Smith.[115] Mikasa retreats, but it is not long before Erwin orders them to attack one more time, claiming this to be the key moment for humanity's survival.[116]Mikasa makes a dash to reach Eren and launches herself at Bertolt, but she misses and sees Eren watching her in panic. Her trajectory carries her straight into another Titan that grabs her hard enough to crush her ribs. Jean, who had been riding just behind her, attacks the Titan, burying his blade in its eye and allowing Mikasa to get free. However, he gets grabbed by a Titan and in spite of their initial shock, the soldiers, along with Mikasa, follow Erwin's orders and continue advancing.[117] With Armin's help, Erwin is able to cut Eren free from Bertolt and Mikasa catches him in the air. The two of them flee on horseback but are knocked to the ground when Reiner begins throwing Titans at the retreating soldiers. As they look up, they see thesmiling Titanwhich ate Eren's mother approaching them. Mikasa is unable to defend Eren due to her injury, but Hannes buys them time in an attempt to avenge Carla. Eren shouts for Mikasa to free his arms so he can help fight, but when he tries biting himself to transform nothing happens.[118] As Hannes is killed and the battle turns against the soldiers around them, Eren falls into despair, feeling that he has never had the power to do anything. Mikasa asks him to listen to her. He showed her how to live with purpose and he wrapped his scarf around her, and for that she is grateful. She smiles, with tears in her eyes, and Eren vows to wrap that scarf around her as many times as she wants.[119]He punches the smiling Titan, triggering something that causes all the other mindless Titans to attack it. In the resulting confusion, he carries Mikasa away on his back and also sends the Titans after Reiner and Bertolt.

Once he pressures Historia into agreement, Nifa begins to detail the operation where they will hand Eren and Historia over to the First Interior Squad and then track them toRod Reiss, the true ruler within the Walls.[132] The kidnapping plan goes awry when Dimo Reeves and his employees are killed.[133]Two days later, the murders are pinned on the Survey Corps and Mikasa and the rest of Levi's squad, sans the Captain himself, are in a stable on standby inStohess District. The squad is uneasy about the coup and Levi's treatment of Historia, but Mikasa thinks that their best option at the moment is to trust him.[134] Mikasa lunges toward Jean in an attempt to save him from his attacker As planned, Levi's squad begins trailing the hearse carrying the two coffins that contain Eren and Historia. They hear gunshots, revealing that Levi has been discovered, and shortly after they see him swing into view. His pursuers are outfitted with specializedvertical maneuvering equipmentdesigned to allow the firing of guns. Levi lands in the wagon and orders his squad to stop following the hearse because it is a trap. Their best option now is to escape and he has Mikasa assist him. The two of them use their maneuvering gear to fight back against their pursuers, but one slips through and Mikasa kicks her down before she can shoot Armin. However, Jean is unable to finish her off and she retaliates before Mikasa can get close enough to stop her.[135] Armin reacts first to save Jean's life, by killing his attacker.[136]When they escape to a cabin safely in the woods, Armin throws up outside, causing Mikasa to worry over him. He asks if this happened to her as well the first time she killed, and she is surprised by the question.[137] Mikasa and Levi capture Marlowe and Hitch while they give their guns to Armin WhenMarlowe FreudenbergandHitch Dreysecome into the forest to look for Survey Corps soldiers, Mikasa and Levi ambush them while Armin distracts them as bait. Mikasa and Armin take their uniforms and put them on with the intention of infiltrating the Military Police to find out where Eren and Historia have been taken. They are to return to Stohess District in disguise to gather clues and capture anyone they think might be an Interior MP.[138] However, Marlowe and Hitch do not take their capture quietly. Hitch berates Levi and Marlowe offers to help their cause. Jean asks if he can handle them and Levi allows him to secretly test their intentions. When they pass, the squad uses their help to launch an attack on an Interior Military Police compound.[139] Mikasa is shocked upon hearing Kenny Ackerman's last name After crippling most of the people inside, Levi and his squad escape with a hostage, but they do not find Eren and Historia. Levi brutally interrogates him about their location until the name ""Kenny Ackerman"" comes out. Mikasa is surprised upon hearing this last name and Levi reacts as well. Before they can question their hostage further, they hear people approaching on foot and their hostage remarks that they have no chance. The Survey Corps is finished.[140] The newcomers turn out to be Hange, Marlowe, and Hitch, arriving with the news that the false charges against the Survey Corps have been dropped and thecapitolis now under the control of Commander-In-ChiefDarius Zacklydue to acoup d'état. Levi's squad celebrates the news. They still have to rescue Eren and Historia though, and Hange has an idea regarding where they are.[141] Hange suspects that Eren is going to be eaten in order to obtain his Titan power. Erwin had a report commissioned on the Reiss estate, and assuming that Eren and Historia were captured by theReiss family, that is likely where they are being held. The day Wall Maria fell a group of bandits burned down the village chapel while the Reiss family was inside, but fire alone should not have destroyed a stone building. After escaping as the lone survivor, Rod Reiss rebuilt the place with his own assets. Hange finds it suspicious, so they head over there.[142] Mikasa discusses Kenny with Levi, the name Ackerman, and the power that comes to those with that name On the way, Levi warns his squad that Kenny Ackerman will be their biggest obstacle, because fighting him will be like fighting Levi himself. He asks Mikasa if she thinks Kenny might be related to her since they share the same last name. She thinks about it and tells him that she knows that her father's family was persecuted, but not the reason why. Levi then asks her whether she experienced a moment when she felt a sudden power awaken inside her and she remembers the moment she took up the knife to kill her kidnapper. She reveals that she did, and upon confirming this, Levi tells her that he and Kenny also experienced such moments in their lives.[143] Mikasa and Levi charge forward under cover of smoke to destroy the First Interior Squad and save Eren They arrive at the chapel and find the secret door leading underground. The team makes preparations for facing theAnti-Personnel Control Squad, which is waiting for them below.[144]When they are ready, they send barrels of gunpowder and bags of oil down the stairs. Sasha sets fire to them with a flaming arrow and fills the underground chamber with smoke, reducing visibility and the usefulness of firearms. Most of the squad provides additional cover withsignal flareswhile Mikasa and Levi scout out their enemies using vertical maneuvering gear. Levi calls for his squad to take out the Interior MPs and the team springs into action. After a concerted push, they manage to force the Anti-Personnel Control Squad into a retreat.[145] Mikasa and the rest of Levi's squad arrive just in time to save Eren and Historia from a transformed Rod Mikasa and the rest of Levi's squad are suddenly stopped by a bright flash deeper in the cavern. She realizes that it means a Titan has transformed and worries over Eren.[146]The squad arrives in time for Mikasa to catch Historia, who had been flung back against the Wall from the force of Rod Reiss' transformation into a Titan. Mikasa asks if she is okay before taking the keys to Eren's chains from her and throwing them to Levi so he can free him. The ceiling begins caving in, trapping the squad. Eren apologizes for being useless, but Levi and Historia goad him into taking matters into his own hands. He gets up and grabs a bottle labeled ""Armor"" that had fallen out of Rod's bag and breaks it between his teeth as he transforms into a Titan.[147] Eren's Titan form then crystallizes, stabilizing the cavern around the squad, preventing them from being crushed. Even after Mikasa helps cut him out of it, his hardened form does not disappear, which Levi states is a huge development, as they can now seal the hole in Wall Maria.[148] Mikasa stops Eren from punching himself Mikasa joins the rest of her squad in meeting up with Erwin and pulling back toOrvud Districtwhere they make preparations to fight the gargantuan Titan that used to be Rod Reiss.[149]At dawn, the Titan arrives and Eren, Mikasa, and Armin assemble a stack of barrels filled with gunpowder at Hange's direction. Mikasa finds Eren moping and prods him back to work. However, to her surprise, he punches his own face to bring himself back to his senses.[150] When Rod reaches the Wall, Levi instructs the Garrison soldiers to flee while the Survey Corps soldiers douse themselves in water to withstand the heat. Eren changes into his Titan and uses the stacked barrels as an explosive by shoving them down Rod's open mouth. Mikasa joins the rest of the Survey Corps in cutting down the pieces of Titan that rain down to ensure that the main body of Rod Reiss is slain.[151] After Historia's coronation, Mikasa is seen with her friends looking for Levi in order for Historia to live up to the last words that Dimo Reeves spoke to her. When they find him, Historia punches him in the arm and all of Squad Levi shouts and cheers. However, Levi smiles at his squad and thanks them in response, much to everyone's surprise.[152] Mikasa interrupts Eren and Historia Two months later, Historia can be seen running an orphanage and taking care of abandoned children. Eren, Jean, and Armin talk about Historia's new role and the country's situation while Sasha, Connie, and Mikasa help carry supplies. When Historia finds them, she tells them to stop slacking. While Armin and Jean go on ahead, she has a small conversation with Eren, but they are interrupted by a stone-faced Mikasa, who takes the items Eren was carrying, saying he is tired from all his training. Eren complains that she should not treat him like an old man.[153] While the soldiers eat and celebrate the success of theExecutioner from Hellfashioned by Hange, Mikasa remains silent throughout most of the conversation until Eren begins to remember the day he ate hisfather. Recognizing where his mind is going, Mikasa stops him, saying that he should finish eating before talking. He does not stop trying to remember though, and suddenly he realizes that the man that his father met the day Wall Maria fell was their old instructor,Keith Shadis. They then decide to pay him a visit.[154]"
What does Mikasa do after hearing the cheers of the citizens?,sits with Eren and Armin talking about their future,Return to shiganshina arc,"Mikasa and the others speak with Keith The following day, Eren, Mikasa, Armin and others travel to the training camp to talk with Keith Shadis.[155]They talk inside a small house and Keith tells them everything he knows: how he metGrisha Yeager20 years ago outside the Walls, his relation with him andEren's motherduring those years, and how he was present in the night Grisha injected Eren with theTitan serum, but did not see anything, and at the end, does not know anything about Grisha's secrets.[156] Mikasa rides towards Shiganshina Some days later, thanks to Eren's training andnew technologydeveloped by Hange, the operation to take back Wall Maria is ready to begin the next day.[157]That night, the soldiers have a great dinner to celebrate.[158]Mikasa is present, eating and watching Sasha's rampage and Jean and Eren's fight.[159][160]Even when Jean blames Eren for the dangers that he puts in Mikasa, she calmly decides not to intervene.[161] When the fight ends, she sits with Eren and Armin talking about their future, what will happen once they reconquest Wall Maria, and wondering if everything will be like before.[162]However Armin not only thinks in that: he considers that being part of theSurvey Corpswill allow them to see the ocean and the whole world.[163] The following day, the Survey Corps are ready to go toShiganshina District. After hearing the cheers of the citizens, Erwin starts the operation at sundown and Mikasa rides along the Squad Levi towards Shiganshina.[164] As dawn approaches, the Corps walk within a mountaintop forest. Mikasa leads Eren's horse, despite his complaints, as the others encourage him to rest as much as possible for his upcoming duties.Jeanspots a nearby Titan and Hange quickly orders the group to illuminate the area with their fragments of theReiss Chapelcave. Hange claims that it is dozing away and the group moves on. A few moments after this, Mikasa begins to recognize the area they are in and claims that she collected firewood there once before. Eren and Armin also begin to recognize the area and Mikasa notes that she can hear the river stream. The group then finds themselves near the Shiganshina District and race in onhorses. Erwin orders that all soldiers switch tovertical maneuvering equipmentand rush the main gate, covered by their hoods to distract any watching enemies. Mikasa is among the soldiers surrounding the gate as Eren flies up above to transform.[165] After Eren successfully seals the hole in Wall Maria, Mikasa retrieves him from his Titan form, and returns him to the top of the Wall. Giving Eren her cloak, Mikasa accompanies the rest of her squad as they return to meet up with Erwin and the rest of the Survey Corps.[166]However, before they can return, they see a signal flare fired by Erwin and stop to await further orders. From her position, Mikasa and her comrades are able to observe as Reiner reveals himself to be hiding inside the Wall, and theBeast Titanand his army materialize to engage the Survey Corps.[167] After taking up positions around the brawling Eren and Reiner, Mikasa waits until Eren is able to maneuver Reiner into an area of town with tall buildings. Once Eren has succeeded in this task, Mikasa and Hange use their newThunder Spearsto blind him. After her teammates destroy the armor covering Reiner's nape, the entire squad moves in and destroys Reiner's nape with their Thunder Spears.[168]Afterward, Mikasa attempts to console a horrified Armin, but is interrupted by Reiner's Titan form, which begins roaring.[169] Mikasa attempts to kill Bertolt After Armin reveals to Hange that Bertolt is approaching, Mikasa and the rest of the soldiers retreat from Reiner's immediate vicinity, in order to escape being caught in the blast of Bertolt's transformation to Titan form. When Bertolt chooses not to transform in order to check on Reiner, Armin attempts to negotiate with him. However, while Armin is attempting to talk with Bertolt, Mikasa takes the opportunity to attack Bertolt from behind. She is unsuccessful in killing him, and comments on his drastic change in personality as he flees.[170] While Mikasa and Armin are returning to their comrades' position, Bertolt finally transforms, and they are forced to hide behind a building to shield themselves from the blast. They then regroup with the rest of Squad Levi and inform them that Hange's squad has apparently been destroyed by the blast.[171]As Bertolt begins destroying Shiganshina, Mikasa observes that he does not seem to know their location. Pointing out that they will not have time to look for any survivors from Hange's squad, Mikasa suggests that Armin take the lead of their squad, though Armin then gives Jean command.[172] After retreating from Bertolt, Eren tries to get Bertolt's attention, but he ignores them. Deciding that they will have to engage Bertolt directly, Mikasa takes Connie's Thunder Spear and prepares to engage Bertolt. While Eren attacks Bertolt directly, Mikasa and the rest of the squad spread out to try to find an opening to attack Bertolt. However, before they can act, Bertolt kicks Eren into the side of Wall Maria, to Mikasa's horror.[173] Jean assures her that Eren is not dead, and that their main concern at the moment is taking down Bertolt. Jean formulates a plan for he, Connie and Sasha to draw Bertolt's attention while Mikasa strikes his nape with the Thunder Spears. Just as Mikasa moves in to strike Bertolt, he uses his steam to prevent her from reaching him. When Mikasa lands on a roof where the others already are, she is visibly injured. She explains that a piece of the Thunder Spears hit her, but the wound is not deep. She asks Armin if he believes there is any possible way for them to fight back, but he sees none. They are startled by the sound of a house exploding behind them. From it emerges Reiner, his head fully regenerated.[174]While Armin and Eren choose to confront the Colossus Titan, Mikasa agrees to join the others in an attack against the Armored Titan.[175] Mikasa defeats the Armored Titan As Reiner begins to run to Eren, Mikasa sends one of her Thunder Spears into his knees, crippling him. She notices the Colossus Titan in the distance beginning to emit much steam, causing her to worry about Eren and Armin for a moment before she returns her focus to the attack on Reiner. While the others proceed with a plan they devised to defeat Reiner, Sasha is injured and misses her Thunder Spear attack on the hinge of the Armored Titan's jaw. Mikasa realizes that since she has the only Thunder Spear left and Reiner's jaw has not been completely unhinged, she cannot proceed with the plan to blow Reiner's body out of his nape by sending a Thunder Spear into his mouth. As she considers the situation, Hange returns to the battle, sending their own Thunder Spear at Reiner and destroying his other jaw hinge. With the plan now on the verge of success, Mikasa jumps into Reiner's mouth, ordering him to get out as she sends her final Thunder Spear into his mouth, defeating the Armored Titan.[176] While Hange interrogates an injured Reiner, Mikasa begins treating Jean's injuries. Although Hange wants to execute Reiner, Jean convinces them to keep him alive long enough to steal his powers with theTitan injection. Hange orders Mikasa to go retrieve the serum from Levi, and to send up a signal flare if there is a change of plans, so that Hange will know to kill Reiner.[177]When Mikasa arrives at Levi's position, she is horrified to find a hysterical Eren trying to keep a badly-injured Armin alive. As Levi agrees to use the Titan serum to save Armin's life, Mikasa shoots a flare to notify Hange that Reiner must be killed.[178]However, Levi's mind is swayed by the arrival ofanother soldier, who reveals that Erwin is also mortally wounded. Horrified by Levi's announcement that he will save Erwin and not Armin, Mikasa draws her blade and begins to advance upon him.[179] Mikasa attacks Levi As Levi punches Eren in the face, Mikasa pins him to the rooftop and draws her blade to his neck. Noticing how worn out Levi is, she attempts to grab the Titan serum from his hand, as Levi reminds her that without Erwin's strength, humanity can never defeat the Titans. When Floch approaches her, she flips her blade in order to strike him with the blunt side of the sword and knock him down, only to be stopped byHange Zoë.[180]As they both struggle, Mikasa eventually capitulates, remembering a happier time when she, Eren and Armin were children, as tears roll down her face. After Armin returns to his human form, Mikasa, along with Eren, pick him up off the ground as she cries tears of joy to see he is alive and well.[181] Atop the Wall, afterEreninformsArminof what has happened after the battle ended,Hangeorders Mikasa,Leviand Eren to continue surveying and head for theYeager family's house.[182]Upon reaching the basement's door, Eren tries to open the door's lock and is surprised that the key does not fit. Mikasa says that she is sure that was the keyDoctor Yeagerhad. Levi then proceeds and kicks down the door and they enter room.[183]They find it had been set up to appear as much as possible, a common doctor's office, however, after further investigation, Mikasa discovers a keyhole on a locked drawer in the desk, which the key unlocks. The drawer seemed empty at first, but Levi notices the false bottom and under it, were three hidden books kept intact with various preservatives. Mikasa and Eren open the first book,[184]and within it they find an uncannily realistic portrait of Grisha standing beside a fair-haired woman and a child. On the back of it, Grisha had written that it is not an illustration, it is called a photograph and that humanity has not perished.[185] Mikasa refuses to accept the thirteen-year rule Upon returning to the Walls, Eren and Mikasa are put in prison cells as punishment for their actions against Levi. During this time, Armin visits them and logs Eren's memories as he retells them of many events in his fatherGrisha's life that matched up with what was found in the books in his basement. Among these memories is a conversation between him andEren Kruger, an allied spy to theEldian Restorationists. During this conversation, Kruger tells Grisha that anyone who has inherited thepower of the Titanswill only live for 13 more years, as no one with this power can outlive its original ownerYmir Fritzwho founded the nation ofEldiaand all its subjects. Upon hearing this revelation, Mikasa becomes very depressed and denies its validity, knowing that Armin and Eren only have a short number of years left to live if it is true.[186]After Hange, the current commander, puts too much pressure on Eren in the next prison cell, Levi ordered them free. Mikasa leaves her cell, having lost weight in her state of depression.[187] Mikasa attends a military meeting, on how to proceed with the findings of the basement, in Trost. She sits silently as Hange deliberates their interpretation of the events, but is shocked and confused when Eren shouts all of a sudden during the meeting.[188]Mikasa then continues being quiet, until the conclusion of the meeting, with the decision made to release all discoveries made by the Survey Corps to the public.[189] The nine surviving members of the Survey Corps later attend a ceremony, to be honored for their success in theBattle of Shiganshina District. Before the start of the ceremony, Eren gets into an argument with Floch over Armin being saved over Commander Erwin. When she attempts to calm Eren down, Floch commends Mikasa over her acting like an adult and giving up in saving Armin. This statement surprises and upsets her.[190]She would later go on to be commemorated for her bravery in Shiganshina with a medal. Mikasa experiences the ocean with Armin Roughly a year after theBattle of Trost District, the Titan Guillotines had eradicated all Titans within Wall Maria, allowing citizens to repopulate Shiganshina. The Survey Corps was able to hold an expedition beyond the Walls for the first time in six years. Mikasa ventures out on horseback, beyond the Walls for the first time. After following a deformed Titans trail, the Survey Corps reach the edge ofParadis Island, and behold theocean.[191] The Survey Corps dismount their horses, discard their boots, and head to the beachfront. Mikasa is startled by an ocean wave, but goes on to give Armin a warm smile. She listens, as Armin begins to joyfully talk with Eren over the size of the ocean. However, these happy moments fade as Eren solemnly states that the ocean does not hold freedom, and enemies are over the other side.[192]"
What does Mikasa show to the Hizuru ambassadors?,the tattoo on her wrist,Marley arc,"Mikasa shows the tattoo on her wrist to the Hizuru ambassadors One year after retaking Shiganshina, Mikasa goes with the other members of the Survey Corps to intercept a survey ship sent from Marley. Like the others present, Mikasa is surprised to see two sailors rebel and force the others to surrender. While watching the two meet with Levi and Hange, Mikasa ponders what their plan might be while trying to wake up Sasha.[193] An alliance is formed between Paradis and the group of rebels, calling themselves theAnti-Marleyan Volunteers, and preparations and training begin for the impending war with Marley. While at a firing range, Mikasa and Armin both agree that it is good to see both sides are getting along with each other, but are visibly troubled by Eren's insistence that Paradis must launch a preemptive assault on Marley to buy themselves more time to prepare.[194] Later on, Mikasa is among the Survey Corps members that meet with an ambassador from the nation ofHizurunamedKiyomi Azumabito. Mikasa is left dumbfounded whenYelenacalls her attention to the fact that Kiyomi's physical features strongly resemble her late mother's, explaining that the similarities are due to the fact that Kiyomi's family are relatives of her mother's. At a meeting between the two parties, Kiyomi displays the crest of the Azumabito clan and Mikasa is shaken to see it is the same as the tattoo on her wrist. After some prompting by Eren, Mikasa shares it, saying that her mother gave it to her as a girl and to pass it down to her children later on. Kiyomi describes how both Hizuru and Eldia were allies long ago and laments that the nation suffered after the Great Titan War. Kiyomi finishes by stating that Mikasa is the descendant of Hizuru's lost lord and the hope for their nation. Although Mikasa is overwhelmed by this information, Historia is ecstatic, believing that Hizuru will be more willing to trust Paradis due to Mikasa's lineage.[195] Later, after spending the day building train tracks, Eren mentions that he only has roughly five years left to live and begins to consider who he should pass his Titan abilities to. Mikasa immediately volunteers herself but Jean advises against it; Mikasa is half-Asian, and they do not know what theAckerman clanis , so she might not even be capable of becoming a Titan at all. As the others volunteer themselves also, Eren decides to not choose any of them due to valuing their friendship and not wanting to have any of their lives forcibly cut short on his behalf.[196] Mikasa is one of several Survey Corpsmen who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. When Eren leaves in the middle of the meeting, Mikasa and the rest of the 104th graduates go searching for him.[197] Eren asks Mikasa about what he means to her Mikasa finds him looking at a cluster of refugee tents. At first, she begins to reprimand him for going outside alone when he is their enemies' most wanted target, but then she realizes that he is looking at the boy who stole from Sasha and Levi earlier in the day, as well as the boy's family. Eren tells her that these tents are where these people live after losing their homes to war. The people here are like the two of them. One day life stopped being normal and everything was taken away. He asks Mikasa why she cares about him so much, whether it is because he saved her when they were kids, or because they are family. Mikasa stammers at first but then replies that he is family. The rest of their friends arrive and interrupt their conversation, disappointing Eren. The group end up having dinner with the family living near the Azumabito estate, spending the night drinking and carousing.[198] The soldiers sit in on a hearing between politicians to discuss Eldian mistreatment. They are horrified when the speakers begin calling for the hatred being shown towards Eldians to be redirected towards the Eldians living on Paradis. As they are listening, Mikasa notices Eren quietly depart from the meeting.[199] Mikasa flips over the War Hammer Titan, detonating her Thunder Spears As Eren begins hisassaulton the Marleyans, Mikasa joins the Survey Corps in retrieving him and attackingLiberio. During the battle betweenErenand theWar Hammer Titan, Mikasa attacks the War Hammer from behind, using a modified mount with multipleThunder Spears. She launches all eight at the War Hammer's nape, seven of which land solidly in the neck, where they explode. Mikasa lands on the shoulder of the decapitatedAttack Titanand asks Eren to come home.[200] She later questions him if he has an idea of what he has done, as he has killed civilians, including children, and there is no way to undo that. However, Eren does not answer the question and instead points out that the War Hammer Titan is still alive. Mikasa is shocked to see the Titan standing up, since she is sure that she destroyed its nape completely, and the War Hammer Titan then fires a pike of its hardened substance towards them. Mikasa quickly grabs Eren and flees away of the Attack Titan's body, barely avoiding getting struck. Eren comes up with a plan to defeat and eat the War Hammer Titan, and asks Mikasa to distract the enemy enough for him to enact it.[201]Mikasa re-engages the War Hammer Titan while Eren transforms back into the Attack Titan and capturesLara Tybur, who was hiding under the ground encased in crystal and controlling the War Hammer remotely via a long cord. Mikasa watches as Eren severs the connection and prepares to eat Lara, but then is horrified to seeGalliardattacking him from behind, and she and Levi go to aid him.[202] Mikasa launches a Thunder Spear at the Jaw Titan After Levi and Eren manage to hold off Galliard, Mikasa intercepts him and knocks him down off the wall with aThunder Spear. Other Survey Corps soldiers come to fight the Titan but they are shot by the Panzer Unit on topPieck'sCart Titan, although Mikasa is among the ones who manage to escape. She then sees Eren being caught off guard by the reappearance of the War Hammer Titan and thenZeke Yeager'sBeast Titanarriving to the battle. As Zeke joins Galliard and Pieck and orders them not to let anyone escape and wipe them all out, Levi orders the Corps to face their enemies and to survive.[203] Mikasa prepares to re-engage the Jaw Titan While the Survey Corps and Warriors clash, Mikasa attempts to destroy the War Hammer's crystal with a Thunder Spear, but it fails to even crack. Staying close to Eren, she watches as he then unsuccessfully tries to consume the crystal.[204]She witnesses an explosion at the nearby harbor, signaling the arrival of Armin and the Colossus Titan. When the Jaw Titan attempts to charge Eren, Mikasa intervenes. Having worn an updated set of the traditional vertical maneuvering gear alongside the anti-personnel variant, she draws her blades and prepares to fight it once more.[205] Mikasa slices at the legs of the Jaw Titan, crippling it Mikasa swings her swords at the Jaw Titan but it lunges out of the way and goes for the Attack Titan. She follows it and tries to provide support and as it momentarily breaks off from the attack, Mikasa notes that this current Jaw Titan is much faster and different fromYmir's Titan.[206]It then switches its focus from Eren to an incoming airship that serves as the Survey Corps method of retreat from the battle. Mikasa anticipated the Jaw Titan going after it and manages to catch it off guard; she comes from underneath it and throws it off balance by slicing through both legs and severs one of its feet. Mikasa observes Eren using the Jaw Titan to kill and consume the powers of the War Hammer Titan. After Eren gets caught by surprise from Reiner's Armored Titan, Mikasa flies to Eren and convinces him to come back home. She then leaves with Eren and flies toward the incoming airship.[207] After they board the airship, Levi kicks Eren due to his insubordination, infuriating Mikasa; she tries to protest, but is stopped by Armin.[208]The four meet with Zeke andYelenaat another part of the ship. A commotion ensues outside and Connie and Jean enter the room, carrying twocapturedstowaways. Jean announces that one of them shot Sasha and she is unlikely to survive, prompting Mikasa and Armin to run out of the room to see her.[209]Sasha dies from her injuries, with Mikasa and Armin futilely trying to wake her.[210] After the Survey Corps return to Paradis Island, Mikasa attends the funeral service held for the eight soldiers lost during the battle in Liberio. Afterward, she remains by Sasha's grave to continue mourning.[211]"
What does Mikasa oppose when Connie mentions they should be prepared to kill Eren if he sides with their enemy?,killing Eren,War for paradis arc,"As Mikasa is visiting Sasha's grave, she is interrupted by the sound of Connie and Jean savingNiccolofrom being harassed by a Military Police Brigade soldier. As Niccolo pays his respects to Sasha, Mikasa informs him of how she died.[212]Later that night, Mikasa is with Armin, Connie and Jean, with the latter expressing dismay that the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers were arrested. Mikasa opposes killing Eren When Connie mentions they should be prepared to kill Eren if he sides with their enemy, Mikasa opposes him but he glares at her and asks if she would side with the enemy too. Mikasa says no, but claims that Eren still cares for them and tries to convince them his recent behavior is reflective of that.[213]The others do not believe her and Jean brings up the fact that despite this, Eren still had no problem forcing them to fight and that resulted in Sasha's death. Mikasa is further shocked when Connie stated that Eren laughed when told that Sasha had died. Armin decides they should prepare for a worst-case scenario to have someone turn and kill Eren if he proves to be a threat; Mikasa protests that he still has several years left, but Armin states they will decide what happens after confirming where Eren stands.[214] After a group of Survey Corps recruits leak the news of Eren's arrest to the public and are found out, Mikasa attends the hearing that Hange conducts with them. After hearing them out, Hange orders the perpetrators jailed for their actions, and Mikasa escorts one of them,Louise, to her cell. Louise tries to justify Eren's actions and convince Mikasa to help free him, but Mikasa simply cuts her off and leaves.[215]She meets up with Armin and notifies him that Darius Zackly has agreed to see them. Both of them are stunned to hear Zackly refuse their request to see Eren and Mikasa is taken aback by the possibility that Zeke Yeager has been controlling Eren's behavior and movements prior to the attack on Liberio.[216]After being sent away, Mikasa notices several Military Police soldiers enter Zackly's office and decides to eavesdrop;[217]Armin tries to persuade her not to, but she insists on knowing what direction the Survey Corps is going. Suddenly, she grabs Armin and dives away just as an explosion goes off in Zackly's office. They both go outside and see Zackly's dismembered corpse from the blast; Mikasa is speechless about who could have been behind the assassination as the crowd of protesters chant in approval.[218] Mikasa is informed of Eren's escape During an emergency meeting by the other heads of the Military, Mikasa hears Armin testify that he observed several recruits from the Survey Corps leave the area and were most likely responsible for the explosion. She is shocked to hear Eren has escaped confinement and blocked his escape route so no one could follow him.[219]Mikasa accompanies Armin, Hange andOnyankoponas the military conduct a search for the renegades, staring blankly ahead and unresponsive to Armin as he tries to calm her.[220] Later, Mikasa attends another meeting to plan the military's response to the emergence of the rebels, now dubbed the ""Yeagerists."" As the meeting concludes, Kiyomi pulls Mikasa aside to ask her to consider fleeing to the Azumabito's ship if the need arises. Mikasa thanks her for her consideration, though makes clear that she sees herself as an Eldian foremost, and intends to see the fate of the island that raised her. Furthermore, after Kiyomi tells her of the Azumabito's shaky political situation, Mikasa says that this is all the more situation to not rely on the family. Despite Mikasa's words, Kiyomi states that no matter what happens with the island, the family will protect her. Heading outside with the other Survey Corps veterans, Mikasa briefly squabbles with Connie over Eren's connection to the Yeagerists, and over being suspected. Believing Zeke to have a secret scheme, the corps ride out to a lead; a restaurant employing Marleyan workers.[221] Mikasa protects Gabi After arriving for their investigation and meeting up with Niccolo, Mikasa and the others wait in a backroom for him to finish his work. A short while later, Armin calls everybody into the main room, where Niccolo is attacking the run-away Warrior candidates over the murder of Sasha. Eventually, whenMr. Blouse's understanding attitude calms the situation down, Mikasa goes over to thefemale candidateto check on her wounds. Suddenly, another young girl namedKayaattempts to stab the candidate, however Mikasa blocks the attack. Mikasa and Armin take her into the next room as theBlouse familyweep.[222] In a separate room, Mikasa sits with Gabi and Armin; when asked by Gabi why she saved her, Mikasa does not give any reason why when Eren unexpectedly appears. Before they can say anything, Eren silently holds up his right hand which is bleeding. Understanding Eren's intent if they do not comply, Mikasa and Armin obey his request to sit down at the table.[223]As they hear Floch lead the others away, Mikasa can only sit in stunned silence while Eren and Armin begin to talk. When Eren mentions himself finally being free, Mikasa says that he is not and is being controlled by Zeke. She mentions how Eren was not like this ever before and brings up how he saved her from being kidnapped all those years ago, pointing to the scarf Eren gave her.[224]Eren glares at her and firmly reminds her to keep her hands on the table. Stunned by this reaction, Mikasa silently complies. Eren tells Mikasa he has always hated her After Eren calls Armin a useless traitor, Mikasa asks Eren what he is doing and hears that Eren learned about her family's lineage from Zeke as well. She hears from Eren that the Ackerman clan can manifest the power of the Titans while remaining in human form and will activate in the presence of a person recognized as the king. He muses that her instincts as an Ackerman are the sole reason why Mikasa has stuck by him for so long. Bringing up the example of her attempted kidnapping, Eren reminds Mikasa that she only acted when he told her to.[225]Realizing this, Mikasa tries to explain it off but Eren remarks that Ackermans also suffer severe headaches due to their true selves fighting the urge to protect the host. Recalling that it happened to her, Eren flatly states the real Mikasa died that day in the hut and all that is left are her Ackerman instincts. Mikasa is unable to speak and starts to break down and cry when Eren claims he has always hated her, calling her nothing more than an obedient slave.[226] When Armin tries to assault Eren, Mikasa swiftly blocks his attack and slams him into the table, much to both their shock and horror. As Eren starts beating Armin, Mikasa continues to cry and begs him to stop. Eren then orders her, Armin and Gabi taken away to Shiganshina District.[227]Afterwards, Mikasa is relocated to a prison cell alongside the other captives.[228]During her imprisonment, Jean inquires more about her recent encounter with Eren from Armin but Mikasa rebuffs the remarks not wanting to explain. They are then interrupted by Yelena who came to explain Zeke's true intentions.[229]Afterwards, Mikasa remains idle as the others react to Yelena's explanation of the euthanization plan.[230] Mikasa leaves her scarf behind As the fight on the rooftop ensues, Mikasa and the other prisoners wonder what the sound overhead them was about.[231]Onyankopon arrives shortly to release them, requesting that all imprisoned soldiers join the fight against Marley to keep Eren safe. As they head to put on sets of vertical maneuvering equipment, Mikasa and Armin discuss what Eren's motivations might be for pushing them away. Although Armin is unsure of Eren's intentions, he assures Mikasa that Eren was lying about her Ackerman genes, and simply used his knowledge of her headaches to give his lie credence.[232]As she is suiting up, Mikasa is visited by Louise, who tries to bond with her. Mikasa ignores the girl, and departs for the battle field; before leaving, she folds up the scarf given to her by Eren and leaves it behind.[27] Along with the others, Mikasa notices Zeke getting shot and falling off the wall. As Armin decides they must neutralize the Cart Titan, both of them are shot at by several Marleyan soldiers hiding in a nearby house.[233]After Connie destroys it with a Thunder Spear, Mikasa goes with Armin to the Cart Titan while Commander Pixis and Nile Dok of the Military Police coordinate efforts on the ground. Suddenly, a loud scream is heard throughout the district; Mikasa sees several flashes of light and realize that Zeke has transformed the affected soldiers into Pure Titans.[234] Mikasa kills two soldiers before facing the Cart Titan Reaching the top of the wall where the Cart Titan is stationed, Mikasa saves Armin after he destroys the Titan artillery cannon atop its back. Cutting through the soldiers accompanying it, Mikasa then glares at Pieck. She is then charged by the Cart Titan and angles out of range while preparing to strike it.[235]Before they can engage, Eren and Zeke make contact, causing the Wall to collapse and abruptly ending Mikasa's attack.[236] Mikasa and Armin are horrified to see theTitansinside emerging. Looking at Eren's new Titan form, Mikasa wonders if there was any other choice they could have made, or if she had answered differently when Eren had asked her what he meant to her, that could have avoided the battle they find themselves in now. As the Wall Titans begin to march, Armin assumes that Eren is using the Founding Titan to send the Wall Titans to attack the forces amassing in Marley to attack Paradis. However, he is perplexed to see that all of Wall Maria is crumbling, telling Mikasa that an attack on Marley should have only required the Titans contained in Shiganshina's outer Wall. They are interrupted by Eren, who begins speaking to all Subjects of Ymir through the Founding Titan. To Mikasa's shock, Eren declares that he is going to be using the Founding Titan to completely exterminate all life outside Paradis Island.[237] Mikasa and Armin regroup with Jean and Connie, who have Falco with them. Noticing their fellow soldiers being attacked by Titans, Armin and Jean go to help them but Mikasa points out that they need to deal with Falco. Jean suggests feeding the boy to one of the Titans while Connie argues that his mother should be allowed to eat Falco. Armin does not want to sacrifice Falco at all, arguing that killing him will only breed more animosity with the Warriors. The group is attacked by a Titan, allowing Connie to flee with Falco before the group can stop him.[238] Mikasa kills a Titan at headquarters The group returns to the military headquarters where they rally the soldiers trapped inside to help them kill the Titans which have amassed around the building. After clearing out the first wave of Titans, Mikasa's group lies in wait at the building while more soldiers lead the remaining Titans to the building to be killed, subsequently clearing all of them.[239] When combat had ended, Mr. Blouse brings Mikasa and Armin to go meet with Gabi, who begs them to return Falco to her. Armin explains what has happened to Falco and Gabi desperately tries to argue that Eren can return Connie's mother to normal with the Founding Titan in order to spare Falco. Gabi argues that he was capable of even removing the Armored Titan's hardened skin, prompting Mikasa to ask Gabi about Reiner's whereabouts.[240] Armin is frustrated by Mikasa's question concerning Eren Mikasa tries to convince Armin not to pursue Connie to Ragako, but is unsuccessful. As Armin is leaving Mikasa tries to ask Armin what they will do about Eren, causing Armin to lash out at her for not focusing on more pressing issues that they have. He then tells her that Erwin would have had better judgment in that moment, and departs. As Armin leaves, Mikasa notices that her scarf is no longer where she left it. Mikasa later finds Jean and Floch with a dead Volunteer and demands to know what happened. Floch claims to be acting on Eren's behalf to wipe out any resentment Paradis might have. Floch attempts to recruit Jean but Mikasa interrupts him, demanding to know what happened to Hange and Levi. Floch claims, to her shock, that Zeke killed them.[241] The next morning, Mikasa finds Louise in the infirmary wearing her missing scarf. Louise claims that Eren told her to throw the scarf away, so she decided to take it instead, prompting Mikasa to demand that she return it immediately.[242]Later, Mikasa and Jean are contacted by Hange, who informs the two of the plan to join forces with Marley to stop Eren. Mikasa agrees to it.[243]After receiving the signal from Jean to leave the military headquarters, Mikasa departs with her comrades.[244]On their way out of Shiganshina, they pick up and join forces with Annie and Reiner.[245] Mikasa confronts Annie That night, the combined forces of Marley and Paradis share a meal as they discuss how to oppose Eren.[246]As tensions run high between the Survey Corps and the Warriors, Annie demands to know if the Corps will be able to kill Eren if no other option is presented. Mikasa states that killing Eren is not the only way to stop him, confirming Annie's suspicions that Mikasa and her friends would try to stop the Warriors from killing Eren. Mikasa steps up to confront Annie, but she defuses the situation by assuring Mikasa that she has no issue with Eren living if he can be convinced to stop theRumbling.[247] The next day the group travels to Paradis' harbor with the intention of using the Azumabito clan's airship to pursue Eren, only to find that the harbor has been occupied by Yeagerists.[248]As the group gears up for a confrontation Annie suggests launching an all-out attack and Mikasa reminds her that they cannot risk getting the Azumabito killed in the crossfire. The discussion is interrupted by Hange, who reveals to everyone's horror that Eren and his Titans have apparently already reached Marley. The group settles on a plan to try to trick Floch into handing over the Azumabito mechanics so that they can operate the ship. Floch instead tries to execute the Azumabito, necessitating Mikasa to intervene and save them. Mikasa helps Kiyomi disarm Floch and his guards, but Floch manages to escape and alert the other Yeagerists to their attack. Mikasa, Hange, Jean and Magath lead Kiyomi and the mechanics to the basement of the building they were being kept in and take shelter there so that Annie and Reiner can transform and fight without risk of collateral damage.[249] Mikasa carries Annie as they flee the harbor After it is decided that the flying boat will be taken toOdihaso that it can be prepped for flight under more favorable conditions, Mikasa brings news of the change to Annie and Reiner and instructs them to protect the Azumabito service crew. As Mikasa engages the Yeagerists, she is alerted by Hange about reinforcements arriving by train but is shocked to see the train derail itself. Once the boat is ready to depart, Mikasa helps carry an injured Annie onboard.[250] On board the ship, Mikasa andJeanare seen holding backAnnie, who is in distress, afterHangereveals thatLiberiocannot be saved from theRumblinganymore.[251] Upon arriving in Odiha, Mikasa helps out with the preparations for the flying boat to take off. While working, Mikasa suggests that Annie practice with the new anti-personnel equipment but Annie reiterates that she does not intend to continue helping the group. Mikasa notices Annie watching Armin and reminds her that he will be going with them to find Eren, but Annie does not change her mind. Annie asks Mikasa if she will kill Eren to save humanity and Mikasa claims that she will not.[252] Mikasa kills Floch As work on the flying boat nears completion, Mikasa and the other soldiers prepare to depart. However, Floch reveals himself inside the hangar, having followed them across the ocean, and fires on them. Mikasa fires one of her anchors into Floch's throat, killing him before he can harm anyone, but she is not quick enough to stop him from rupturing the boat's fuel tank. As Eren's Titans arrive in Odiha, the group is forced to depart without Hange, who stays behind to buy them time to escape.[253] En route to Eren, Mikasa participates in the meeting to discuss the best plan to stop him. During the meeting, Mikasa inquires about Reiner's hunch that Eren wants to be stopped by someone. The meeting is interrupted as the group is being pulled intoPathsby Eren. As his comrades try to talk Eren down, Mikasa pleads for Eren to return to them. Seeing Eren in the distance, Mikasa and the others try to reach him but are unable to get any closer. Eren tells them that he called them to Paths to let them know that they will have to kill him to stop the Rumbling, before sending them back to the flying boat.[254] As the flying boat reaches Eren it comes under fire from the Beast Titan. Mikasa and her comrades jump from the boat and use their maneuvering gear to evade the Beast's projectiles before engaging it directly.[255]The group makes short work of the Beast Titan, only to find that Zeke is not inside its nape. Mikasa is alarmed when Armin decides to transform and use the explosion to find Zeke, but Armin reassures her that he does not intend to kill Eren. However, before Armin can execute his plan an army of Titans begins generating atop Eren and abducts him. Pieck is disabled while trying to blow up Eren's nape and Levi orders his squad to focus on saving Armin. Mikasa prepares for a last stand They do not get far before Bertolt Hoover's Colossus Titan appears. It disables Reiner's Titan and throws it at the group, knocking them off Eren's Titan. Mikasa is left the only soldier with functioning maneuvering equipment in any state to fight leaving her as the only one to defend her comrades from the approaching Titans. She is quickly overwhelmed defending all of her comrades and Levi uses up the last of his strength to aid her, but passes out from his injuries in the process. Mustering her strength, Mikasa prepares to make a last stand against the Titans, only for them all to be whisked to safety by Falco, who has learned to fly in his Titan form.[256] Atop Falco's Titan, Mikasa reveals to Annie that Armin has been captured by Eren's Titans and asks Annie to help rescue him. Levi decides to have the group split up to simultaneously rescue Armin and detonate the explosives on Eren's nape, to Mikasa's horror. Mikasa tries to change her friends' minds but is unsuccessful and Annie orders her to focus on rescuing Armin to take her mind off Eren. Mikasa pursues the Okapi Titan Arriving at Eren's Titan's tailbone, Mikasa, Connie and Annie identify the Titan which took Armin and begin their pursuit of it. As the three fight off the Titans which attack them, the Okapi Titan which took Armin flees and Mikasa has Annie throw her in its direction in the hopes of catching up to it. However, other Titans begin physically shielding it and she eventually breaks her blades on the skin of an Armored Titan. Annie saves Mikasa from the Armor, but the two of them and Connie are left surrounded as the Okapi flees to Bertolt's Colossus Titan.[257]Just as they are about to be overwhelmed, Bertolt's Titan intervenes and begins fighting alongside them. Mikasa uses the opportunity to pursue the Okapi again and is finally able to cut Armin out of its mouth after Gabi shoots it in the head.[258]Jean manages to detonate Eren's nape thanks to the help of their new allies and Mikasa joins her friends in evacuating atop Falco's Titan so that Armin can transform.[259] As the group touches down in Fort Salta, Mikasa begins suffering from another headache, grieving that the last conversation she had with Eren ended with him claiming he hated her. The group is relieved to see that Reiner survived Armin's transformation, but they are disheartened to see that Eren and thecentipedealso survived. To Mikasa's distress, Levi decides that the only hope they have of stopping the Rumbling is killing Eren so that the source cannot reattach itself to him. The source begins emitting smoke into Salta and the soldiers realize that it is attempting to transform the Eldians in the fort into pure Titans. Leaving behind Jean and Connie, Mikasa joins Levi and Pieck in boarding Falco and departing to face Eren once again.[260] As they draw near to Eren, Mikasa experiences another strong headache and is suddenly brought into a Paths place by Eren. Mikasa is living in isolation with Eren following their decision to run away from the Paradis-Marleyan conflict. Eren notices that Mikasa has been crying, and Mikasa wonders if it is okay for her to be there. Eren muses that the only option they had was to run away and live out the rest of his four years in peace together, since he could not bring himself to allow Historia to suffer or to Rumble the people living outside the Walls. Mikasa kisses Eren goodbye Mikasa apologizes for bringing up the past, and Eren asks her to forget about him when he dies. In the real world, Mikasa says that she cannot forget him. Tying her scarf around her neck once again, Mikasa tells Levi that Eren is inside his Titan's mouth and asks him to help her reach him. Levi uses a Thunder Spear to blow a hole in Eren's Titan mouth and Mikasa enters it, immediately severing Eren's head from the spine. Kissing Eren, Mikasa bids him goodbye.[261] Carrying Eren's head, Mikasa finds Armin on the battlefield and the two mourn their friend's death. Mikasa tells Armin that she plans to leave on her own so that she can give Eren a proper burial. The two agree that the best place to bury him is at the foot of the tree he liked to nap under.[262]As Mikasa departs she sees the apparition of Ymir. Understanding that Ymir's love for Fritz was a torment that she cannot undo, she instead thanks Ymir for bringing the life into the world which allowed for her to be born. Mikasa wishes Ymir a good rest as she continues on her way back to Paradis.[263] Mikasa visits Eren's grave Mikasa returns to Paradis Island and, true to her word, makes a small grave for Eren at the tree he liked to sleep under outside of Shiganshina District. Three years after his death, Mikasa visits Eren's grave and reveals that their friends are going to be coming to visit him soon. Wishing to see him again, Mikasa begins to cry. Her tears are interrupted by a bird, which grabs the end of her scarf and tightens it before flying away. As she watches the bird fly away, Mikasa thanks Eren for wrapping the scarf around her once more.[264] Years later, Mikasa continues to regularly visit Eren's grave with her new family for decades before eventually passing away at an old age and is buried with Eren's scarf.[31]"
How many spears does Mikasa have? (A) 8 spears. (B) 8 spears. (C) 8 spears.,(A),Usage ofthunder spears,"While being a new way of weapons manipulation, Mikasa easily mastered how to use Thunder Spears. She has the strength to carry up eight spears with ease, before simultaneously throwing and detonating them on Titans with greater accuracy than theweapon inventor.[266]"

Who is Armin Arlert's childhood friend?,Eren Yeagerand Mikasa Ackerman,Voice actor,"Armin Arlert is the 15th and current commander of theSurvey Corps, named so byHange Zoëbefore their death.[10]He is also a childhood friend ofEren YeagerandMikasa Ackerman, and one of the two deuteragonists of theseries. Although he appears to be among the physically weakest of the104th Training Corps, his intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset, especially when paired with Hange. After thebattle of Shiganshina District, he took thepower of the TitansfromBertolt Hooverand came in possession of theColossus Titan."
When did Armin join the Survey Corps?,After graduating,Personality,"Even when he was young, the naturally curious Armin had a deep fascination with the world beyond theWalls.[16]As a child, he found and studied an illegal book about the outside world that was owned by hisgrandfather. He toldEren Yeager, his best friend, about the book and the information that was contained in it. Armin was branded a heretic by other children for his unusual interest in the outside world, and was thus frequently picked on.[17]Too timid to defend himself, Armin would often rely on his friends Eren andMikasa Ackermanto protect him from local bullies. This, coupled with his frail physique, was a source of much shame for Armin, leading him to have poor self-esteem and to believe that he was a burden to others. Because of this, Armin has always been very eager to prove his worth. As a child, he hoped that one day he would be able to consider himself a true equal to his friends.[18][19][20] Armin prepares to take action When Armin got older he enrolled inmilitarytraining and after graduating he joined theSurvey Corpswith Eren and Mikasa. He wanted, first, to try to make a good and meaningful impact on the world, and second, to fulfill his dream to see the outside world.[21]His curiosity has remained a strong personality trait from when he was young, driving him to do whatever it takes to ensure humanity triumphs over theTitans.[22] Armin continued to have low self-esteem during his training years and for a short while after graduation. During this time, Armin considered himself to be useless due to his lack of physical strength and skill. However, soon after graduation, he came to learn that his mind is an equally valuable asset to the military, and that he can use his brain to help people.[23]Consequently, Armin gradually gains confidence in himself and his abilities. Nonetheless, he can still be hard on himself at times. The fact that he is so willing to sacrifice himself to achieve a goal shows that he still does not value his own life as much as he should.[24] Armin is exceptionally loyal and selfless. He constantly worries for the safety of his friends. He is always prepared to throw himself into dangerous situations to save them, even offering to sacrifice himself for Mikasa.[25]When he,Jean Kirstein, andReiner Braunhad to decide who would be left behind without ahorse, Armin immediately offered himself without hesitation. When Jean was injured in battle, Armin rushed to his aid, placing himself in danger as well.[26][27]Although he and Eren were determined to live their dream of seeing the outside world, Armin was content to give up his life in order to defeat theColossus Titanand to have his dream fulfilled through Eren.[28]Armin is also very level-headed, keeping Eren and Mikasa under control whenever their emotions get the better of them. He has talked down a fight Eren started with a soldier, and restrained Mikasa from acting rashly during Eren's military trial.[29] Armin is a very analytical person. He likes to think deeply about situations and solve problems using his mind. These personality traits, in conjunction with his intelligence, good judgment, level headedness, ability to plan ahead, come up with creative ideas and to think outside the box, are what make him a great tactician.[22]He is not an extrovert or loud person. When he was suddenly thrown into a leadership role that involved being in the spotlight, speaking in front of people and ordering people around constantly, he got quite anxious and momentarily froze up;[30]while he has slowly become more adept at a leadership role, he has still shown some hesitation and anxiety when Hange promoting him as their successor and when Levi asked what they should do to stop the Rumbling.[31][32]Armin has shown great investment in humanity's future, and is always striving for and thinking about how he can change things for the betterment of mankind.[33][34]Armin is also good at thinking on the fly and improvising; when he noticed that the ultimate plan of bothZeke YeagerandYelenaseemed to go against how Eren viewed the world, he kept this to himself and quickly began to act in a manner that would make Yelena and the Yeagerists believe he also was driven by their cause.[35][36] Armin's hard and cruel life has caused him to have certain beliefs about how the world works. Armin believes that in the cruel world, in which they live in order to surpass monsters, accomplish goals or make a difference, one must be willing to sacrifice anything, including their humanity. Armin admires strong leaders such asErwin Smith,Darius Zackly,Ian Dietrich, andDot Pixisfor their ability to sacrifice themselves and their humanity in order to achieve their goals.[37]He believes that tactical decisions should be based on logic rather than emotions,[38]and becomes noticeably affected when others do the opposite. Armin is visibly shaken after killing many citizens and soldiers of Marley Even though Armin makes calculated decisions, he is also a very emotionally sensitive and empathetic person. Due to Armin's kind heart, he faces conflict in his mind with his belief that he has to force himself to throw away his humanity. For example, Armin killed a person to save Jean as it was the logical thing to do; however, he became very emotionally upset afterward.[39]This, in conjunction with the fact that he is hard on himself whenever he does something wrong, means that he has yet to completely throw away his humanity. Armin's most consistent traits remain his kind heart and keen intuition, making him often concerned with the group's morality.[40][41]Even when killing multipleMarleyansoldiers and civilians, Armin emerges from his Titan in tears.[42] Despite this, Armin strongly believes that morality is relative and that there are no universal laws of good and evil. Therefore, he has a distaste for the terms 'good person' and 'bad person', since no one could be either good or bad to everyone. This makes him willing to concoct underhanded, morally questionable plans that shock some of his comrades. Notably, both Mikasa and Eren, his best friends, show no hint of surprise at this ability of his, with the latter even commenting that he had always known Armin was capable of it."
What happened to Armin's parents after escaping Shiganshina?,they were killed during the mission,Prologue arc,"Armin, Eren, and Mikasa see the Colossus Titan In the year 845, Armin would once again find himself cornered by bullies who mock him for his deep curiosity for the outside world.[17]Refusing to fight back, Armin would need to be rescued by the timely appearance ofErenandMikasa. Later, he and his two friends settle by the riverbank, where Eren broods over his desire to join the Survey Corps.[45]Just as Armin muses how theWallscan not protect humanity forever, theColossus Titanappears and subsequently breachesWall Mariaas Armin and the others watch in horror.[49]AsTitansflood theShiganshina District, Eren and Mikasa head back home to find their doomedmother. Armin tries to stop them, but finds himself petrified by fear. Unbeknownst to Eren and Mikasa, Armin was the one to locate and informHannesto save the two before they get killed by the Titans. After escaping Shiganshina, Armin's parents were both drafted to help try to reclaim the lands lost after the fall of Wall Maria. However, they, like most who participated, were killed during the mission, and Armin was left an orphan. Despite being told that his parents were participating in a Recovery Operation, Armin knew that his parents and the other civilians had been sent on a suicide mission so that there would be fewer mouths for thegovernmentto feed.[19]With no family left, Armin moved into a settlement with Eren until the two of them turned twelve, and were able to join theMilitary.[50]"
What did Armin do after enlisting into military training?,"He was able to pass the basic aptitude test after some effort, and tried to help Eren with it when he struggled to stay upright",104th training corps arc,"No longer content with sitting by in the face of the Titan threat, Armin decides to enlist into military training along with Mikasa and Eren.[51]He was able to pass the basic aptitude test after some effort, and tried to help Eren with it when he struggled to stay upright.[52]Although high in intellect, Armin was considered weak in physical strength, and did not graduate at the top of the class. The night after their graduation, and before the trainees had decided on their chosen section of the military, Armin sits with Eren and Mikasa to eat, and watches as Eren responds to a tauntingJeanby finally deciding to set the record straight and giving a moving speech to the whole of the 104th Training on how he wants to kill the Titans to gain freedom and pursue his dream to see the outside world.[53] Armin decides to follow his friends into the Survey Corps After dinner, Armin finds Eren and Mikasa sitting outside the building and joins them, saying that the party is over and that they should head back to the barracks. Before they do, Eren asks Armin which section of the military he will be joining. Armin sits down and reveals that he will join the Survey Corps along with Eren and Mikasa. Eren questions his choice incredulously, citing Armin's physical weaknesses. Armin affirms his worries by acknowledging that he is physically weak. Eren responds supportively but advises Armin not to follow his own crazy course of action while neglecting his own strong points. Armin responds bitterly, saying that he would rather die than become a burden.[54]"
Who is the female titan?,Eren,The female titan arc,"Armin encounters the Female Titan After joining the Survey Corps with Eren, Mikasa and the rest of the 104th's top 10 , Armin participates in the Survey Corps' 57th expedition, venturing beyond Wall Rose. Not long into the expedition, Armin's squad encounters theFemale Titan, which is seemingly highly intelligent and has considerable knowledge about theMilitary's formation. The Female Titan kills Armin's entire squad,[71]but spares Armin's life after carefully removing his hood and observing his face.[72]As the Female Titan moves on,Reinerand Jean meet up with Armin and the three pursue the mysterious Titan. Armin suggests the Female Titan, like Eren, is a human-controlled Titan and is likely hunting for Eren.[73]The three attempt to engage the Female Titan and Armin is thrown off his horse, but, yet again, the Female Titan does not kill him. The three manage to distract her for a while, though she immediately make a beeline for Eren's position after warding Armin's group off.[74] Though they survived the encounter, Armin, Jean and Reiner are left stranded with only one horse, which is only strong enough to carry two at a time. While Reiner is patching Armin up he thinks about the Female Titan sparing him a second time and, given her resemblance and what she appears to know, Armin suspected the Female Titan may be Annie though he keeps this to himself. After being bandaged up by Reiner, Armin offers to stay behind, but luckilyKristaquickly arrives with two spare horses in tow.[75] Reaching theTitan Forest, Armin and his fellow soldiers perch on its many high branches, distracting Titans while Erwin confronts the Female Titan. While they wait, Armin concludes that Erwin withheld vital information from most of the soldiers out of fear of traitors lurking among them. Jean criticizes his commander's actions, but Armin defends Erwin, stating that playing it safe will not bring about change.[76]When the expedition ultimately ends in failure, Armin safely returns to Wall Rose with the remainder of the Survey Corps. Before the operation in Stohess, Erwin, Levi, and other survivors from the 57th expedition hold a meeting in the old Survey Corps headquarters to confirm the identity of the Female Titan. Armin shares his theory that the Female Titan is Annie.[77] Armin confronts Annie Some time later, inStohess District, Armin locates and asks Annie, now a Military Police member, for her help in hiding Eren; they need to flee Wall Sheena to avoid Eren's inevitable execution, and they will need a MP on their side to get through the checkpoints. Although initially hesitant, Annie accepts, and Armin explains that they must smuggle Eren out of Wall Sheena by foot, taking an underground route. As he, Eren and Mikasa enter the underground tunnel, Annie refuses to follow, realizing that Armin has led her into a trap. Armin confronts Annie, asking her why she was in possession ofMarco Bott's vertical equipment during equipment inspection. Annie claims that she simply found it, but then admits to have killed the two captured Titans using her own equipment when Armin accuses her of such. Annie questions why Armin did not take action if he was already so suspicious of her, but Armin states he simply could not believe it, and questions why Annie chose not to kill him when she had the chance. Annie is not sure herself, but congratulates Armin on managing to corner her, confirming her identity as the Female Titan.[78] Armin proposes a plan to distract Annie Armin fires a sound grenade, signalling hidden soldiers to restrain Annie. Despite their efforts, Annie succeeds in injuring herself using a barb hidden in her father's ring, allowing her to transform. Anticipating this, Mikasa grabs both Eren and Armin and takes them further underground as Annie in her Titan form attempts to grab them. Seeing that his strategy has failed, Armin initiates plan B, trying to encourage Eren to fight Annie. Eren tries repeatedly to assume his Titan form, but cannot do so due to his reluctance to fight a friend.[79]Having no other option, Armin suggests he and Mikasa distract Annie so that Eren may safely flee. Realizing that if he does not fight, and that his friends will surely die, Eren finally transforms into a Titan and fights Annie. After realizing that she is fighting a losing battle with Eren and the Survey Corps, Annie decides to make her escape by climbing over the Wall. As Mikasa, Hange and, other Survey Corps scramble to catch up to her, Armin realizes that they will not be fast enough and instructs Eren in his Titan form to propel Mikasa up the Wall, so that she can gain enough speed to overtake Annie.[80]Mikasa cuts off the Female's Titan's fingers and Eren pins her to the ground, allowing the other Survey Corps members to extract Annie from the nape of her Titan. When Eren emerges from his Titan form and asks about Annie's fate, Armin informs him that no one knows. He shows him that Annie encased herself in rock hard crystal upon being pulled out of her Titan. As Eren rehabilitates, Armin takes a moment to rest with the others. Armin informs Jean that Eren's summons to theKingwere cancelled and that Annie is indeed the Female Titan. She is being detained underground after encasing herself in a crystal to avoid interrogation. Reflecting on the mysteriousTitans found in the Walls, Armin observes that for all these years they were being protected from the Titans by Titans. Armin cannot fathom how the Walls were built in the first place, but hypothesizes that abilities like Annie's hardening power were somehow employed.[81]"
What is the name of the girl in the Survey Corps who may know more about the Walls?,Krista Lenz,Clash of the titans arc,"Armin's hypothesis is later confirmed when the rock sample Squad LeaderHange Zoëhad picked up from Annie's Titan body matched the properties of the Walls. With this information in mind, Armin and Hange propose a way to repair Wall Maria: Eren using his own hardening ability to mend the breach.[82]Minister Nickinforms the group about a girl in the Survey Corps who may know more about the Walls, stating that while he cannot share any more details, she can. Armin and the others immediately recognize the girl in question to be Krista Lenz.[83] Armin advising Eren not to fight and to retreat to the Wall instead Rescuing Krista, Reiner,Bertolt, Connie and a grievously injured Ymir fromUtgard Castle, Armin and the Survey Corps regroup on top Wall Rose.[84]However, Armin shortly after learns of Reiner and Bertolt's secret correspondence with Annie, confirming his and Hange's suspicion that the two are also spies.[85]As Reiner and Bertolt attempt to take possession of Eren, they are attacked and nearly killed by Mikasa, but survive.[86]A horrified Armin is present to witness Reiner and Bertolt's Titan transformations, marking the second and third appearance of the Armored and Colossus Titans, respectively.[87] Armin is called by Hange to aid Eren as he battles Reiner in his Titan form. Meanwhile, the Colossus Titan is kept busy defending himself from the rest of the Corps.[88]Advising Eren to retreat to the Wall, Armin provides Mikasa with his spare blades to support Eren against the Armored Titan.[89]Armin and Hange put their heads together and realize that, in order to move, the area behind the Armored Titan's knees must be unprotected. They then advise Mikasa to cripple the Armored Titan's knees, allowing Eren to gain the upper hand.[90]However, just as the battle turns in Eren's favor, the Armored Titan lets out a loud wail, signaling Bertolt, who then proceeds to push himself off of Wall Rose and crash down on Eren and Reiner below.[91] Hannes has an encouraging talk with Mikasa and Armin Reiner and Bertolt succeed in kidnapping Eren and Ymir in the chaos, and Armin informs Mikasa after she regains consciousness that five hours have already passed since then.[92]Mikasa despairs at the news, but her and Armin's determination are revived upon hearing a rousing speech from Hannes.[93]Joining a force comprised of Survey Corps reinforcements, Garrison and Military Police soldiers all led by Erwin, Armin and the others begin pursing Eren and his kidnappers. Before setting off, Armin implores Krista to stay within the Walls, but she insists on joining the effort.[94] As Armin and the others reach theTitan Forestwhere Reiner and Bertolt were resting, they are beset by Titans.[95]Entering the forest with their vertical equipment, Armin's team encounters Ymir in her Titan form.[96]Armin notices Ymir suspiciously surveying everyone and neglecting to attack anyone.[97]His suspicions were confirmed when Ymir suddenly captures Krista and escapes, realizing that she has sided with the traitors.[98] Reiner transforms into his Titan form and flees the forest with Bertolt, Ymir and a restrained Eren in tow.[99]Pursuing on horseback, Armin notes that while the Armored Titan is slow, stopping him will be difficult due to Reiner not shedding his joint armor.[100]Eventually, Armin and his fellow trainees succeed in latching onto the Armored Titan where they implore Bertolt to surrender Eren.[101]Just as Bertolt suffers a breakdown, Armin and the others are forced to briefly retreat when Erwin charges into the fray, followed by a horde of Titans.[102] Armin lies to Bertolt The mass of Titans behind Erwin attack the Armored Titan, slowing him down to a crawl, and Erwin leads his forces into the chaos, seizing the opportunity to rescue Eren. Unfortunately, Erwin is bitten and carried off by a Titan along the way, but Armin remains focused on the mission and joins the second attempt to retrieve Eren.[103]Using his equipment to climb onto the Armored Titan's head, Armin confronts Bertolt, purposefully taunting him with lies that Annie is being tortured while he and Reiner save themselves.[104]Enraged, Bertolt charges at Armin, but is intercepted by a grievously wounded Erwin who slashes Eren off of him.[105]With Eren secured, Erwin's forces retreat, but their escape is cut off by Reiner who tosses Titans in their way.[106] Armin is horrified by the risk Reiner is taking, seeing that Eren could easily be eaten. In the struggle, Eren and Mikasa are knocked from their horse, and Jean is incapacitated as he and the others rush to assist them. With nowhere to run, Armin drags Jean towards a small cluster of trees and prepares to face an advancing Titan with only one sword. He looks to Eren and Mikasa, seeing them in just as desperate a situation. The friends exchange teary-eyed glances, preparing for the end. However, Armin is saved when Eren's ""Coordinate"" power suddenly activates, causing the Titans to attack first theSmiling Titanand then the Armored Titan. This allows Armin to retrieve a horse, and carry a wounded Jean to safety. They retreat from the battlefield, mourning the loss ofHannes, who died in the chaos, and remembering their childhood with him.[107]"
How many people got injured because of Armin?,104th,Royal government arc,"Armin speaks with Eren on his controlling the Titans Returning safely toWall Rose, Armin and Jean agree that the 104th have been exceedingly lucky. As the wounded are taken away Eren grimly remarks that he got captured again and asks how many people got injured because of him. Armin tries to soften the situation, saying that they experienced no losses on the way back, with the Titans ignoring them and only attacking the Armored Titan. He mentions theFemale Titanbeing able to draw other Titans toward itself, and states his and Jean's theory that Eren had controlled the Titans this time. Some time later, Armin is seen helping Jean andSashacarry food into their new relocated house. Armin mentions that there are food shortages all over, and if they lost their current provisions then they would surely starve. After the food is inside, Sasha asks why they brought so much food when they could just easily hunt for it in the woods. Armin reminds her that hunting is prohibited in the area. Eren appears and reminds them all the importance of cleaning off their shoes before coming in causing Jean to yell at him and remind him that he is not his mother. Mikasa and Historia come back after chopping wood, much to Armin's shock, as he tries to remind her that she is not a wild animal and should not be moving around yet. As the group banter and argue, Sasha speaks on how this is like all of them being trainees again. Armin is quick to remind everyone that protecting Eren and Historia is an important task. He then asks why they were selected forLevi's newsquad, commenting on the fact that many veterans are still alive. Eren tells them all to finish cleaning before Levi and Connie return.[108] The group then reunites with Levi and discuss Armin's idea of sealing the hole in Wall Maria using Eren's Titan hardening abilities.Hangeinforms them thatNickwas found dead that morning, tortured and murdered by members of theMilitary Police's First Interior Squad, and Armin wonders how much he would have revealed, though Levi guesses he did not reveal anything. He also was there when Historia told about her past, prior to her enlistment in the Survey Corps.[109] The Squad reads Erwin's plan of a coup d'état During a failed test for Eren to harden his Titan form, Armin was present.[110]He was also present when the group read Erwin's orders, looking shocked at the sight of it.[111]During their first official operation, Armin serves as a body double for Historia, and is eventually captured by the organization that wishes to take possession of Eren and Historia.[112]While being held captive with Jean, who was serving as Eren's double, one of the men harasses him, asking over and over to hear Armin's voice, as he was suspected to be Historia. Armin displayed great discomfort at this, being driven to tears from it.[113] Armin is seen still tied up with Jean as the men issued to take Eren and Krista arrive, observing them silently before they are attacked by Mikasa and Levi. He and Jean then race from their positions, revealing that they were pretending to be tied up, and tie the beaten men up. After the men are successfully detained and questioned by Levi and Mikasa, Levi orders Armin to fix the mouth gag on the man who originally harassed Armin. As he began to fix the gag, the man mentioned that he heard Armin was actually a boy. He then tells Armin that he used to be normal, but Armin now turned him into this and then tells him to do something about it. Armin appears shocked, unresponsive to the man. Jean then tells Armin to leave the work to him.[114] Armin shoots to kill and saves Jean After the Survey Corps capture two First Interior Squad officers, Armin is seen with the rest of his friends talking about how they might be able to pull off a successful coup d'état.[115]He is present when the Survey Corps discuss the plan to make Historia ascend as queen.[116] After Eren and Historia are kidnapped by the First Interior Squad, he is seen at Trost District, preparing with the rest of the Survey Corps to retrieve the caskets in which Eren and Historia are being transported. It turns out to be a trap to lure the Survey Corps, and they immediately try to escape town, with Armin driving a carriage. One female member of the First Interior Squad gets through and tries to shoot Armin, but Mikasa kicks her and she lands on the carriage. She gets up, ignores Jean's threat and knocks his gun away. While she is pointing a gun at Jean, Armin reacts quickly, pulls out his own gun and shoots her in the head. Thus, he helps save Jean. After the SC retreat to safety, he was not able to take the guilt of killing another human being and becomes sick. Mikasa comforts him. Levi tells him that he cannot go back to being the way he was, as his hands are now already dirty.[117][118] Armin baits Marlowe and Hitch into a trap After the Survey Corps is accused of trying to monopolize Eren's Titan powers, the government begins arresting all members of the organization. Armin and the rest of Squad Levi avoid being captured, and camp out in the woods outside of Stohess. The squad ambushes two MPs, with Armin distracting them as bait. Mikasa and Armin take their uniforms and put them on with the intention of infiltrating the Military Police to find out where Eren and Historia have been taken, but the two soldiers, Marlowe and Hitch do not take their capture quietly, and eventually gain the squad's trust, leading them to a nearby MP checkpoint.[119] After crippling most of the personnel, Levi and his squad escape with a hostage and interrogate him about Eren and Historia's location. They hear people approaching on foot and prepare for battle. To the entire squad's delight, it is Hange, who informs them that the Survey Corps has been exonerated, and that they have a lead on Eren and Historia's whereabouts. As the group begins to ride for the Reiss chapel, Armin silently wonders who Eren had inherited his Titan from.[120] Armin plays a pivotal role in planning out their fight with the remaining Interior MP forces stationed at the chapel. The plan is to take cover under the smoke by igniting gunpowder inside barrels and also by utilizing their smoke signals, as it would be advantageous for them with their lower numbers. Armin is one of the soldiers who fire flares to provide cover.[121]Hange is injured during the fighting and Armin is left behind to take care of her. Armin and Hange meet up with Levi's squad after they escape the cavern and follow Rod's Titan as it makes its way to Orvud District, meeting up with Erwin's forces en route. At dawn, the Titan arrives and Eren, Mikasa, and Armin assemble a stack of barrels filled with gunpowder at Hange's direction. Eren sees a group of kids below and remarks on how they remind him of himself and his friends on that day when the Colossus Titan first appeared. Armin agrees, but reminds Eren that there is a difference this time, with them being ready to face the threat. To Armin's surprise, Eren suddenly begins punching himself to bring himself back to his senses."
Where does Armin find evidence that three people had been camping out atop the wall?,the foot of the wall,Return to shiganshina arc,"Armin's enthusiasm about seeing the ocean After Historia has been crowned queen, he is seen helping out at the farm for the orphans and people in need from theUnderground.[122] He and the rest of Survey Corps prepare for the upcoming mission for retaking Wall Maria and have meals together. Before they set out for the mission, he reminisces their childhood with Eren and Mikasa, and enthusiastically talks of being able to see the outside world, stating that they should start by visiting theocean.[123] During the journey towards Shiganshina, he notices Eren seemingly in fear and doubt and encourages him, reminding him of their collective dream to see the outside world, making him feel better.[124] Armin confronts Reiner After arriving in Shiganshina, Armin and his squad take up positions atop Wall Maria. As the rest of his squad proceeds to the breach in the wall, Armin notices the remains of a campfire nearby and alerts Erwin. On Erwin's orders, Armin proceeds to the foot of the wall where he finds evidence that three people had been camping out atop the wall. He returns to Erwin to inform him of what he has found, and the two of them deduce that there is likely a fourth person accompanying their enemies who warned them of the corps' approach so that they could hide. To Armin's surprise, Erwin gives him command of a team of soldiers, and orders him to find where their enemies are hiding.[125] As he is searching, Armin recalls the fact that the Walls are filled with Titans and deduces that there might be hollow spots where the Warriors could be hiding. He orders his team to search the wall for hollow areas and despite their initial skepticism Erwin orders them to obey. One soldier stumbles across a hollow spot and from within emerges Reiner who immediately kills him. He prepares to attack Armin, but Levi swoops down and intervenes.[126]Armin is once again entrusted by Erwin to help direct the battlefront where they would fight theArmored Titan. He relays Erwin's plan to take on the Armored Titan to squad leader Hange.[127] After they blow Reiner's head off, he laments that with their abilities they could not afford any negotiations. However, Reiner's Titan form gives out a roar and Armin immediately realizes that it might be a signal to call Bertolt. Sure enough, he sees a barrel hurling towards them from the sky, thrown by theBeast Titan.[128]With the Colossus Titan coming from above, Armin and the soldiers try to flee from the scene, but turns around when he realizes Bertolt had not transformed yet.[129]Instead of attacking Bertolt, Armin reminds everyone that they should make a last attempt to negotiate with him. Armin tries to negotiate with Bertolt Bertolt shares a bitter conversation with Armin, claiming that it was he who decided to come up with malicious schemes in order to conquer humanity. Thinking fast, Armin throws Annie's name in the conversation, declaring that only Bertolt is capable of saving her from the Military Police. Bertolt coldly dismisses Armin's remarks and approaches him with his blade ready. He reveals to Armin that he saw through his plan long ago, but he just wanted to ensure that he is to kill them properly. A confused Armin asks why Bertolt thinks that all humans are descendants of evil, but Bertolt shrugs the question off and continues to advance towards him.[130]Before he can reach Armin, however, Mikasa attacks Bertolt from behind, forcing him to defend himself and then make a quick escape to find Reiner. Armin attempts to chase after Bertolt, but Mikasa stops him, warning of Bertolt's intentions to transform.[131]Sure enough, Armin soon feels an immense explosion resonating throughout the district, signifying that Bertolt has taken his Titan form.[132] Armin witnesses the Colossus Titan destroy the district. When Jean asks Armin for a plan, Armin advises to tire out the Colossus Titan because it cannot climb over the Wall. Jean interrupts Armin's plan, deeming it too dangerous to risk leading the Colossus Titan to the Wall due to Erwin's group being on the other side. Jean concludes that a tactical approach is the logical plan; however, they have limited supplies, such as their vertical equipment. Armin realizes that this is their only chance of attack solely counting on their current manpower. Jean asks Armin for the next phase of his plan, but Armin is out of ideas and requests Jean to take over. Following Jean's orders to reach the river, Armin climbs onto Eren, who stays out of sight from the Colossus Titan. Jean tells Armin that he might be able to get a grasp of their situation, however in the end he would have to rely on Armin's planning for it to work.[133]Armin, incredibly frantic, is reprimanded by Jean to stop. He is tasked to observe the Colossus Titan from the farther back while Eren attacks him to keep him from reaching the Wall.[134] Armin asks Eren to stick to his plan Armin looks on in horror as Eren is kicked to the top of the Wall by the Colossus Titan.[135]As Mikasa retreats from a burst of steam from the Colossus Titan, Armin notices that Mikasa is hurt. She asks him if he has come up with any other ideas, but he has not. Before they can come up with any other plans, Armin looks on in shock to find the Armored Titan still alive and ready to battle once more.[136]After some consideration, Armin finally comes up with a plan; he explains to the group that the Colossus Titan has become thinner compared to when it first transformed, meaning that it will soon run out of energy. Armin tells Jean and Mikasa to go after the Armored Titan, while he and Eren will take on the Colossus. Reminiscing the days when he and Eren promised each other that they would one day see the ocean, Armin comments that if this plan fails, he will never get to see it. Armin then stabs Eren's Titan form, telling him to wake up.[137]Armin succeeds in waking Eren and explains the plan to him, telling him to go through with the plan no matter what. Eren hesitantly agrees.[138] Armin sacrifices himself to distract the Colossus Titan In accordance with Armin's plan, Eren lets his Titan form fall to the ground in front of the north gate, seemingly defeated. Armin stays on the Wall, pretending to be surprised. As Eren's Titan form falls he secretly hardens his body and escapes through the nape, fleeing from the scene. Armin stays to face the Colossus Titan, thinking about how Eren will carry out his dreams to see the ocean if this plan takes too long. Grappling to the Colossus Titan's teeth, Armin succeeds in getting Bertolt to emit a massive wave of heat and smoke. Armin remains grappled as the heat begins to hinder his breathing, but he remains resolute in his decision. Bertolt begins to pity Armin's selflessness and emits a massive wave of searing heat and steam to kill Armin quickly.[139] As Armin's flesh, skin, and clothing begin to burn off, Armin chooses to remain grappled, realizing that he is about to die and that Eren must see the ocean in his stead. Soon, Armin's grip on his sword hilt is broken, sending his charred body flying to the rooftops below.[140]As Bertolt inspects Eren's hardened Titan form, Eren uses his maneuver gear to get behind Bertolt, slicing him out of the Colossus Titan's nape. As Eren stands on the roof by Armin's body, he sorrowfully says that Armin was always the bravest of his comrades.[141] As Eren mourns Armin's sacrifice, sadly looking down upon his body,[142]Eren hears Armin breathing faintly and urges Levi to use theTitan injectionon Armin. Levi agrees at first, but then reconsiders when he discovers that Erwin is still alive.[143]After a tense altercation with Mikasa and Eren, Levi, remembering Erwin's final moments, decides to use the serum to save Armin and transform him into a Pure Titan. Armin's Titan form eats Bertolt who had been left behind on a rooftop for that purpose. After eating Bertolt, Armin emerges in his human form, unconscious and fully healed, having acquired the power of the Colossus Titan.[144] Armin sees the Colossus Titan in his dream While unconscious, Armin has a nightmare about Bertolt. When he comes to atop the Wall, he notices Sasha lying next to him and notices her severe injuries. He sees Eren heading toward him and he hugs Armin when he reaches him, relieved that he is awake. Having lost his memories of the events immediately before his transformation, Armin is confused, so Eren informs him on the recent events that happened. After hearing this, Armin acknowledges that he ate Bertolt. He feels sick and asks his comrades why they did not save Erwin instead of him. Levi states that Armin should not let others regret their decision on choosing to save him, including himself. Hange claims that Armin and herself will have to prepare for whatever comes next and that they are in similar situations. Hange then says that she, Levi, Eren, and Mikasa will be heading out while Armin and the rest of the soldiers remain atop the Wall resting and keeping watch.[145] After their mission, Armin returns to Wall Rose with the remaining members of the Survey Corps.[146] While Eren and Mikasa are imprisoned for having violated military law, Armin stays with them. On one occasion, when Eren wakes up screaming and confused, Armin reminds him why he was in jail. He is confused by Eren's choice of language at this time.[147]For the rest of their time in jail, Armin helps Eren validate the three books discovered in the Yeager familybasementby comparing them with Eren's memories. Here, Armin recognizes that his lifespan, like all previous holders of a Titan power, has been shortened due to the Curse of Ymir.[148] After visiting Historia in Trost, Armin attends a meeting, along with the rest of the Survey Corps, to discuss how the Wall people should progress following Shiganshina.[149]He stays silent, seemingly until the end of the meeting, when it is decided to make the basements discoveries public knowledge.[150] Armin and Mikasa experience the ocean for the first time Later on, Armin joins the Survey Corps to be honored for their bravery and success in theBattle of Shiganshina District. Before the meeting begins, Armin brings up the matter of the Titan injection with Floch. Floch candidly states that Erwin was the better choice for the serum, and that all other people reading the report agreed. After a short argument between Floch and the 104th Survey Corps members defending Armin, the group is called into the hall to begin the ceremony. Armin receives a medal along with the rest of the Survey Corps.[151] One year after theBattle of Trost District, the Survey Corps embarks on a scouting mission beyond the Wall. After a long journey on horseback, Armin fulfills his dream when the Survey Corps reach theocean. Down at the beach front, Armin seems joyful at having accomplished his dream, yet when attempting to speak about the ocean with Eren, he is only reminded of the threat lurking on the other side of the ocean.[152]"
Who does Armin work with to destroy more than thirty additional ships sent to Paradis by Marley?,Eren,Marley arc,"The Colossus and Attack Titans guard Paradis One year after retaking the territory within Wall Maria, the military of Paradis discover aMarleyansurvey ship near the island. Armin goes with the Survey Corps to intercept the forces and witnesses Eren's Titan upend the ship and forcing it on the shoreline. After two spies,YelenaandOnyankopon, rebel and shoot the captain of the ship, Armin watches from afar the two meeting with Hange and Levi. He notes that it is fortunate they get the chance to learn more about the people of Marley but is put off by Eren saying Paradis needs to strike hard at Marley.[153] Over the next three years, Armin works with Eren to destroy more than thirty additional ships sent to Paradis by Marley.[154][155]During that time, Armin notes that people from both Paradis and Marley are learning more about each other and that the citizens are just like them; not all the people of Marley were enemies and are open to working together for a better future. Armin takes part in a meeting where Onyankopon describes that he is from a different country and race than the Eldians; Armin asks him who made them all and is told the same one who made the people of Marley, the Subjects of Ymir and who granted the power to Ymir herself; a God.[156] While at a shooting range with Eren and Mikasa, Armin is proud to see both sides cooperating and interacting with one another. He notes that the port at the harbor will be done soon, and believes that Eldians and Marleyans will soon be able to fully cooperate and work together without any tensions on either side. Eren then asks if he could see anything from Bertolt's memories, and Armin says nothing that could help them. He looks to Eren and asks if they should go along with Yelena's plan, questioning if there is another way. Armin suggests that both sides should gather and discuss their misunderstandings with Marley and the other countries before resorting to violence but Eren cuts him off and claims that the world still sees them as monsters, feeling that it would be pointless. Armin reasons that they merely need time and Eren again insists that Paradis must make the first strike against Marley to buy them the needed time.[157] In 853, Armin and the rest of the 104th help construct railroads in Paradis. While aboard a train, Armin overhears the others discuss who should inherit Eren's Titan abilities after his tenure expires in five years; he silently reflects on how Eren valued each one of his friends and that due to wanting them all to live for a long time, he would not accept any of them as his successor.[158] Armin is one of several Survey Corpsmen who journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi. During their meeting, Armin is distressed to hear that it will be exceedingly difficult for the Azumabitos to convince the world's powers to begin accepting Eldians once again, noting that the only other option would be to take advantage of Historia. Eren leaves in the middle of the meeting, and Armin and the rest of the 104th graduates go to look for him. They find Eren and Mikasa speaking with a family living near the Azumabito estate and agree to eat dinner with the family, spending the night drinking and carousing.[159] The soldiers sit in on a hearing between politicians to discuss Eldian mistreatment. They are horrified when the speakers begin calling for the hatred being shown towards Eldians to be redirected towards the Eldians living on Paradis. As they are listening, they fail to notice Eren quietly depart from the meeting.[160] Armin reveals himself before transforming Eventually, the Survey Corps receive a letter from Eren informing them that he will be launching an attack on Marley against their orders and coordinate a rescue. Armin is tasked to infiltrate the Marley harbor near the internment zone atLiberio. At the time of the Survey Corps attack, Armin sits in a fishing boat within the harbor as the Marleyan armada approaches. When navy soldiers call out to him stating that it is dangerous, Armin removes his cloak's hood and stares tellingly at them before unleashing an explosive energy burst inland and causing massive damage, transforming into the Colossus Titan. This explosion destroys the battleships coming to Liberio's reinforcement.[161]In his Colossus Titan form, Armin looks down at the destruction that he has caused, noting sadly thatBertoltlikely witnessed the same scene when he attacked Shiganshina District. He then exits from his Titan form and uses hisvertical maneuvering equipmentto make his way onto an airship that has been occupied by the Survey Corps' forces. He discusses withHangeabout entering Liberio by using the low-level airspace, moving alongside the lights placed earlier by the Survey Corps in order to collect their troops; a very dangerous mission as everyone has only one chance to board the ship, and the ship can also be shot down. Hange questions whether Armin is possessed byErwin's ghost to come up with such a risky idea, but Armin replies that he wishes this was the case if that could give them strength; but at that moment, if they are unable to retrieve everyone and Eren, they will have no future.[162] Armin talks to Annie after returning to Paradis Armin helps Eren onto the airship, and subsequently stops Mikasa from responding after Levi kicks Eren and has him detained.[163]The group goes to another room in the airship, where they hear an uproar through the door shortly after. Jean then comes through the door with tworestrainedchildren, explaining that they had boarded the airship and one had shot Sasha, who was unlikely to survive her injury. Armin and Mikasa rush out of the room to see her, but Sasha dies shortly afterwards prompting the two to break down in tears.[164] Returning to Paradis, Armin is left distraught by Sasha's death, and by the knowledge that it was Eren's rash actions that led to her death as well as the deaths of numerous innocent civilians. Following Sasha's burial, Armin visits Annie's crystal to ponder Eren's unpredictable behavior. Reflecting that despite his desire to understand Eren more than anyone , Armin admits that he no longer can. He notes that due to the civilian lives that were lost as a result of the Survey Corps' actions, Armin laments the lost opportunity for peace; however, Armin does try to justify to himself that their actions were necessary to keep Marley at bay for the time being. As he finishes ruminating, he pleads for Annie to respond to him in some way.[165]"
What is the name of the group that Armin attends to the questioning of a group of four Survey Corps members who had spread the word that Eren had been imprisoned after the Raid on Liberio?,Anti-Marleyan Volunteers,War for paradis arc,"Later, he meets with Mikasa, Jean and Connie and reflect on how theAnti-Marleyan Volunteerswere arrested even though they helped give Paradis aid. Despite agreeing with Jean's disbelief, Armin reflects that it was already decided while they were in Marley.[166]He listens to Connie and Jean accuse Eren of sending them to fight despite supposedly valuing their friendship and is stunned to hear Connie's remark that Eren laughed after hearing Sasha died, instead of expressing sorrow or anger. Armin recalls how Eren will be in control of the Founding Titan during 'The Rumbling' and resolves to arrange for them to talk with Eren to determine which side he is on. Accepting that they must be prepared to kill Eren if he switches sides, Armin proposes a worst-case scenario to have someone transformed into a Titan and obtain Eren's powers before the end of his tenure. Mikasa protests this but Armin repeats that they have to discuss with Eren and determine first if he is still on their side.[167] Armin tries touching Annie's crystal Armin later attends to the questioning of a group of four Survey Corps members who had spread the word that Eren had been imprisoned after the Raid on Liberio.[168]Afterwards, Armin goes back to the holding area underground where Annie's crystal is located. He goes over and touches it to try and access any information they can use. Suddenly, he hearsHitchbehind him telling him not to touch Annie's crystal. Armin stammers that Titan memories can be transferred via touch and was merely trying to see if he could see anything; he pleads with Hitch not to ban him from visiting Annie.[169]They walk back outside and Hitch hands Armin a newspaper, reporting that people are distrusting the Survey Corps even more than usual. Armin agrees, but insists they must hurry and figure out Eren's true motives before it is too late. Hitch goes off to help several other members to keep the protesters away while Armin goes with Mikasa to a meeting scheduled withDarius Zackly. Mikasa protects Armin from the explosion He is shocked to hear Darius refuse their request to see Eren at this time. When Armin asks why, both of them are stunned when Darius reveals to them the belief that Eren may be under the control of Zeke.[170]Armin insists they can be useful in figuring out Eren's motives, but Zackly still does not allow it and dismisses them. Moments after leaving, an explosion occurs and Mikasa grabs Armin and protects him from the blast. Armin and Mikasa are horrified to see both the mangled corpse of Darius, blown apart from a bomb planted in his office, and the crowd of protesters seemingly in support of the act.[171] The military receives news of Eren's escape During a meeting going over the attack, Armin recalls seeing Zackly's chair in his office and that Darius mentioned a group of recruits had brought it to his office. Having seen a group of Survey Corps recruits leave as they arrived at headquarters, Armin pieces the two together just as word reaches to them that Eren has escaped confinement.[172]At a loss for words, Armin goes with Mikasa, Hange, and Onyankopon to figure out their next course of action. Armin attends another meeting to discuss how the military will deal with theYeagerists. Pixis instructs the military to secure Historia and Zeke, and tells Armin that his defenses with the power of the Titans must be stronger than ever. Recognizing Pixis as the acting Commander-in-chief, Armin asks him if he has any long term plans. He is then surprised by the Commander's reply that they should surrender to Eren and begin negotiations. After the meeting's conclusion, Armin leaves with the other Survey Corps veterans to visit a suspicious restaurant employingNiccolo.[173] After arriving at the restaurant to question Niccolo, Armin and the others wait in a backroom for him to finish cooking. A short while later, Armin opens the door to the dining hall after hearing a commotion, and sees Niccolo attacking the run-away Warrior candidates. He quickly calls the others into the main room, but is kept at bay due to Niccolo threatening one of the candidates. Eventually, whenMr. Blousecalms the situation down, Armin and Mikasa bring theWarrior candidate who had killed Sashainto the backroom, allowing theBlouse familyto weep.[174]As Armin talks with Gabi, he remarks that her mentality is very similar to how Eren used to act; just then, Eren arrives unexpectedly and shocks both Mikasa and Armin. Armin tries to speak with Eren, but notices his palm is cut and bleeding; seeing Eren's intent forces both Mikasa and Armin to comply with Eren's demands.[175]They sit down at the table with Gabi, and Armin asks Eren if Floch and the other Yeagerists are there to harm the others; Eren merely says they are simply being moved to another location. Armin asks Eren if Zeke and Yelena have swayed him to their cause and what drove him to attack Marley on his own. Eren merely responds that he is free at last to do whatever he pleases and questions if Armin is still visiting Annie, greatly shocking Armin. Eren tells Armin that if memories truly play a part in forming who a person is, that means Bertolt's memories have become part of Armin; he calls Armin a soft and useless pawn of the military.[176] Armin punches Eren for verbally abusing Mikasa As Eren reveals Mikasa's heritage has been the sole reason she has stayed by his side, Armin notices that Mikasa is visibly suffering from this and orders Eren to stop; after Eren calls Mikasa a mindless slave, Armin goes to attack him only to be blocked by Mikasa: this stuns and horrifies both of them.[177]Armin is still able to punch Eren, who takes the blow and throws him against a shelf. Eren mocks Armin's fighting abilities and effortlessly beats him. As Eren orders his followers to take them away, Armin bitterly asks if Eren wanted the freedom to hurt Mikasa and calls Zeke a piece of shit while claiming Eren is the true slave; this angers Eren and has them all taken to Shiganshina District.[178]Armin is then confined alongside those recently captured by the Yeagerists.[179] Sometime later, Connie asks Armin to use his Colossus Titan to escape but the notion is rejected due to the Titan's destructive power. Jean would then pry into the details of Armin and Mikasa's encounter with Eren but Mikasa idly brushes off the question. Their conversation is halted when Yelena arrives and subsequently surprises everyone by shootingGriezfor insulting the Eldians.[180]As Yelena explains Zeke's true motives, Armin begins to cry claiming he is moved by Yelena's noble intentions before a soldier arrives to inform them about the infiltrators.[181]The Survey Corps members and other prisoners are subsequently alerted by the rattling of the walls and Armin remarks that the Titans have started moving.[182]Several minutes later, Onyankopon arrives and unlocks the cell door, asking they help Eren. As Connie slams him against the wall, Armin tells Connie to let him go and hear his side before doing anything. Armin theorizes Eren's actual plan After Onyankopon continues to plead his innocence and that he did not desire to eradicate the Eldian race, Armin recalls the time when they conversed about how someone thought it would be interesting to have different kinds of people in the world which includes Eldians.[183]Helping him to his feet, Armin asks Mikasa if she wants to help Eren; after getting a reluctant response, Armin mentions how he believes what Eren said to them was nothing more than just a lie to make Yelena and Zeke believe he was on their side. He continues on by stating that when the Rumbling is activated, the other nations will be observing from Marley and see that the few hundred Titans within the Walls awaken will prevent them from attacking Paradis Island.[184]After the other captured soldiers are released, Armin goes to suit up with Mikasa. As Mikasa continues to believe what Eren said about her to be true, Armin brushes her concerns aside and states that Eren used the excuse about her headaches to make the lie more believable. As they reach the roof, they spot Yelena staring up at the destruction overhead. As Yelena mentions how Zeke was able to defeat both Hange and Levi, Armin continues to play along and rallies the others to join the Yeagerists in saving both Eren and Zeke in order to save the world.[36]Armin then turns around to see Yelena peering down at him intensely and then asks for them to save Eren. As the Survey Corps try to get close to Eren, Armin and the others notice Zeke getting shot atop the Wall and falling back down to the ground.[185]As Armin decides him and Mikasa need to target the Cart Titan, they both get shot at by several Marleyan soldiers. After Connie launches a Thunder Spear and saves them, Armin overhears Commander Pixis and Nile Dok organizing the ground soldiers; he agrees with the plan and has Mikasa go with him to get behind the enemy.[186] Armin destroys the Cart Titan's artillery cannon As they travel through the air, Armin and the other Survey Corps soldiers hear Zeke scream and notice several flashes of light throughout Shiganshina District; they realize that the affected soldiers have been turned into Titans and their task will now be even harder.[187]Reaching the Cart Titan, Armin fires a Thunder Spear at it and destroys the artillery cannon. As Pieck and the soldiers try to kill Armin, Mikasa swiftly kills the two soldiers.[188]Armin then angles around Pieck as Mikasa aims to strike the Cart Titan. As they are fighting, Armin and Mikasa are caught off guard as Wall Maria begins to crumble,[189]and are horrified to see theTitansinside emerging. As the Wall Titans begin to march, Armin assumes that Eren is using the Founding Titan to send the Wall Titans to attack the forces amassing in Marley to attack Paradis. However, he is perplexed to see that all of Wall Maria is crumbling, noting that an attack on Marley should have only required the Titans contained in Shiganshina's outer Wall. He is interrupted by Eren, who begins speaking to all Subjects of Ymir through the Founding Titan. To Armin's horror, Eren declares that he is going to be using the Founding Titan to completely exterminate all life outside Paradis Island.[190] Connie is furious at Armin for refusing to sacrifice Falco Armin and Mikasa regroup with Jean and Connie, who haveFalcowith them. Although Jean half-heartedly tries to justify Eren's plan, Armin is firmly opposed to the genocide Eren is about to commit. Noticing their fellow soldiers being attacked by Titans, Armin and Jean go to help them but Mikasa points out that they need to deal with Falco. Jean suggests feeding the boy to one of the Titans while Connie argues that his mother should be allowed to eat Falco. Armin does not want to sacrifice Falco at all, arguing that killing him will only breed more animosity with the Warriors, but Connie angrily points out that Armin is being a hypocrite for not allowing his mother to be saved the same way Armin himself was saved. The group is attacked by a Titan, allowing Connie to flee with Falco before the group can stop him. The group returns to the military headquarters where they rally the soldiers trapped inside to help them kill the Titans which have amassed around the building. After clearing out the first wave of Titans, Armin's group lies in wait at the building while more soldiers lead the remaining Titans to the building to be killed. Armin recognizes one of the Titans to be Pixis and quickly mourns the commander before executing him. After the fighting, Mr. Blouse brings Armin and Mikasa to meet Gabi, who begs them to return Falco to her. Armin explains what has happened to Falco, and Gabi desperately tries to argue that Eren can return Connie's mother to normal with the Founding Titan, but Armin points out that Eren would likely have used such an ability on the Titans in Shiganshina if he could. Gabi frantically argues that Eren should be able to, as he was able to undo the Armored Titan's hardening abilities. Hearing this, Armin recalls Eren's proclamation that he has undone all hardening and realizes that Annie's crystal must have also been affected.[191] Armin is saved from being devoured Armin decides to depart for Ragako with Gabi to try to catch Connie. Mikasa tries to convince him that it is futile, but Armin is determined to at least try to preserve any chance of making peace with the Warriors. Mikasa attempts to ask what they should do about Eren, causing Armin to lash out at her. Immediately regretting his actions, Armin laments that he was the one saved in Shiganshina, not Erwin, as Erwin would have been able to handle the current situation. Armin departs for Ragako with Gabi soon after.[192] Armin and Gabi arrive at Ragako as Connie is preparing to feed Falco to his mother. When Armin fails to talk Connie down, he reflects once again that Erwin should have lived instead of him and chooses to sacrifice himself to save Connie's mother. However, he is saved from being devoured by Connie who explains that he has come to realize that his mother would not want someone else to be sacrificed for her. After returning to Shiganshina, the group takes time to rest and eat. As they are eating, Armin and Connie discuss the possibility of Annie having escaped her crystal. As they are speaking, they realize that Annie is sitting next to them. The group and Annie make a plan with Jean, Mikasa andPieck Fingerto escape Shiganshina. After receiving a signal from Jean to leave the military headquarters, Armin departs with his comrades. On their way out of Shiganshina, they pick up Reiner.[193] Armin feels guilt whilst recalling the events during the Raid on Liberio The group camps together and attempt to learn Eren's location from Yelena.[194]Things go sour when Yelena instead begins trying to turn the group against each other by reminding them of each side's crimes, Armin's attack on Liberio's port using his Colossus Titan being one of them.[195]She eventually gets Jean to attack Reiner for causing Marco's death, forcing Armin and Connie to separate the two.[196] The group travels to Paradis' harbor with the intention of using the Azumabito clan's airship to pursue Eren, but find that it is already occupied by Yeagerists.[197]The group gears up for a possible engagement, but Armin and his friends are reluctant to fight their former comrades. Their discussion is interrupted by Hange who announces to everyone's horror that Eren has apparently already reached Marley. A desperate Magath apologizes to the Eldians for how he and the rest of Marley treated them and begs them to cooperate with him. As part of a plan to trick Floch into turning over the Azumabito mechanics, Armin and Connie ride into the harbor and tell Floch that they have been pursuing the Cart Titan ever since it devoured Jean and Onyankopon. They tell Floch to send the Azumabito mechanics to help them start the ship so they can continue their pursuit and proceed to the ship without waiting for his response. They are stopped byDazandSamueland, seeing that the plane has been rigged to explode, demand that they disarm it. Daz and Samuel question them about their allegiance and Armin and Connie manage to convince them to begin disarming the bombs on the plane. Armin gets shot in the jaw, chest and stomach by Samuel As they are waiting for the mechanics, Armin and Connie are horrified to hear gunshots, followed by an announcement from Floch that they and Mikasa are traitors. Daz begins rewiring the bombs on the plane and Armin tries to stop him, only to get shot in three places by Samuel. As Connie wrestles with Samuel, Armin continues to try to stop Daz despite his injuries. Daz tries to shoot him, forcing Connie to kill Daz and Samuel to save Armin.[198] While their allies fight the Yeagerists, Connie carries Armin to Magath. Connie goes to help the others whilst Magath carries Armin aboard the boat.[199] Annie asks why Armin talked to her during captivity After his injuries have healed, Armin goes to the deck of the boat[200]where he is suddenly taken into Paths by Eren. Eren reveals to Armin his Attack Titan's power to see memories of the future and that all of his cruel actions in the past days were committed with the desire to distance himself from his friends in preparation for the atrocity he was about to commit. He attempts to apologize for beating Armin, but Armin insists that he should be apologizing to Mikasa for the things he said to her. Armin asks if Eren's intentions were to set up his friends as the world's saviors, which Eren confirms; the world now owes a debt to Armin and his friends for saving it from imminent destruction. Armin points out that the outside world might still retaliate but Eren reveals that his Rumbling has wiped out 80% of the world's population, meaning all foreign nations will be unable to retaliate for the foreseeable future. Armin is horrified and asks if Eren's actions were necessary but Eren ignores him and instead asks that Armin follow him to another place. Eren takes Armin to an erupting volcano to show him the ""liquid fire"" he had read about as a child, lava. The two discuss Ymir Fritz and Eren reveals to Armin's surprise that the reason Ymir remained servile to king Fritz even centuries after his death was because she truly loved him. The two proceed onwards to a new location, a snowy landscape, where Eren continues explaining Ymir's mindset. Armin is shocked to learn from Eren that Ymir was seemingly freed from her millennia-long servitude by Mikasa. Eren reflects that every atrocious act he committed was unknowingly done in the service of freeing Ymir, and Armin acknowledges the pain that his friend must have been in to shoulder such a burden on his own. Eren begins confessing more, but Armin cuts him off to spare him the pain. The two go to the ocean and Armin asks Eren if he believes Mikasa can move on from him. Eren claims he does not know, causing Armin to punch him in the face for pushing her away. Armin ridicules Eren, suggesting that Mikasa will forget about him quickly, causing Eren to break down and admit that he does not want Mikasa to move on. Armin tries to convince Eren that they will find a way to keep him alive but Eren refuses to entertain the idea, reminding Armin that he will never be forgiven for what he has done. Armin thanks Eren for taking on the world's hatred for Paradis The ocean scene before them transforms into a ruined landscape of trampled land and bodies, and Eren admits to Armin that he would have kept Rumbling even if his friends had not tried to stop him. Armin demands to know why, but Eren claims he does not know. As Eren prepares to erase Armin's memories temporarily, promising that they will return after his dies, Armin finds a seashell on the ground. Giving the seashell to his old friend, Armin thanks him for everything he has done for Paradis's sake. The two embrace... ... And Armin is once again standing on the deck of the boat, with no memory of his and Eren's conversation.[201]Annie calls him over to sit with her and thanks him for talking to her while she was stuck in her crystal but asks why he chose to talk to her and not anyone else. Armin tries to tell Annie how he feels about her but Annie chooses to instead believe that he only talked to her because he is a good person. Armin reminds her that he does not like being called a ""good person,"" noting that he has killed many people and chosen to betray his own race. Armin laments that the world beyond the Walls did not match his and Eren's dream, but he tells Annie that he still chooses to believe that there is a part of the world yet to be discovered.[202] After arriving in Odiha, Armin helps move the flying boat into a hangar to be worked on. His comrades try to remove the explosives on the boat, but Armin suggests leaving them in case they are needed later. After helping the mechanics for a time, Armin returns to the boat to find Levi attempting to walk. He tries to convince Levi to continue resting, but Levi insists that they need to interrogate Yelena. Hange appoints Armin the 15th commander of the Survey Corps As preparations for the flying boat near completion, Armin bids goodbye to Annie, who has decided to stay behind. Before the group can depart, however, Floch reveals himself and shoots holes in the boat's fuel tank, necessitating repairs. As repairs begin, though, Eren's Titans arrive in Odiha. Armin volunteers to stay behind to hold them off, but Reiner insists that the Colossus Titan will be needed to stop Eren. Hange decides to stay and hold the Titans off, and names Armin as the 15th commander of the Survey Corps. Armin and the others manage to get the boat running before the Titans reach the hangar, all onboard are left heartbroken by Hange's death.[203] En route to Eren, Onyankopon informs Armin that the flying boat was only fueled halfway before taking off. Armin entrusts Onyankopon to keep get the boat to Eren before returning to the rest of the group to plan how to approach Eren. Based on Levi and Pieck's descriptions of Eren's Titan, and the knowledge that War Hammer inheritors can remotely control their Titans, Armin and Pieck agree that the best plan would be for him to use his Colossus Titan's transformation to destroy Eren's Titan in one attack, although Armin still insists on trying to talk Eren down first. Prompted by Reiner, Armin reminds the group that Eren has not restricted them from using their Titan powers, even though he has the ability to do so, and suggests that Eren might be trying to goad them into stopping him. The conversation is interrupted when the group is abruptly pulled intoPaths. Armin immediately tries to negotiate with Eren, arguing that his actions will dissuade anyone from harming Paradis for centuries to come. He hears Eren's voice, telling him that the Rumbling will not stop, before seeing a child-like Eren in the distance. Armin, Mikasa, Jean, and Connie try to reach him, but they are unable to get any closer. Armin tries to get Eren to speak with them, but Eren tells him that he only called them to Paths to tell them that they will have to kill him to stop the Rumbling.[32] Armin engages Eren and asks him what part of him is free As the flying boat reaches Eren, Armin tries to get Onyankopon to abandon the flying boat with the rest of the group, but Onyankopon insists on staying with the boat to get it as close to Eren as possible. As the boat gets closer it comes under fire from the Beast Titan, and Armin and his friends are forced to abandon the boat in the middle of the barrage. Using their maneuvering gear, the group avoids the Beast's projectiles and begin engaging it.[204]They make short work of the Beast Titan, but find that Zeke is not inside its nape. At Jean's prompting, Armin orders his comrades to evacuate the area so that he can transform and use the blast to try to uncover Zeke's location. As he prepares to transform, Armin recalls his former conviction that leaders must be willing to make sacrifices and begrudgingly admits that he might need to kill Eren. However, before he can transform Armin is attacked from behind by a Titan. As the Titan begins to swallow him whole, Armin is surprised by the sight ofYmir Fritznearby, watching him. Armin berates his unconscious self Inside the Titan's mouth, Armin begins to suffocate. He concludes that Ymir is the one generating Titans to defend Eren and begins to lament that he and his comrades are powerless to stop the two of them. As he begins to pass out Armin seesBertolt Hooverstanding before him, crying.[205]Armin stares down at his unconscious body and grows frustrated that it will not move. As he remembers his friends, he begins insulting himself, lamenting that all he ever does is let himself and others down. As he angrily proclaims that he has wasted the second chance at life he was given, Armin realizes that he is surrounded by sand. Seeing the sand, Armin realizes that the fact that he can still see and think means that he is still getting oxygen to his brain and is still alive. Realizing he is in the Paths again, Armin realizes that he might be able to continue helping his friends through the connections all Eldians have in Paths. His thinking is almost immediately derailed, though, when he sees Zeke Yeager sitting nearby. He introduces himself to Zeke, and Zeke asks Armin if Ymir has consumed him.[206] Armin listens to Zeke Armin sits with Zeke and listens as Zeke explains his theory about the origin of life. Zeke theorizes that all lifeforms find their meaning by ""multiplying"" and that it was a resultant fear of death which caused Ymir to spawn her undying Titan body and escape to the world of the Path. Zeke theorizes that the reason she continued to obey the Fritz family for 2000 years was because she still felt a connection to the world and that she likely chose to help Eren because he was the first person able to understand her. Armin tries to get Zeke to tell him how to escape the Path world, but Zeke believes there is no point in continuing to fight. Armin reminds the man that their allies are fighting for the lives of innocent people, but Zeke points out that every living thing must die eventually. Seeing a leaf stuck in the soil, Armin recalls a time in his youth when he raced Eren and Mikasa to the top of a hill outside Shiganshina. Recounting the memory to Zeke, Armin claims that in that moment he had felt that the only reason he had been born was to try to race his friends. He had felt that same way reading as a child, feeding small animals, and shopping with his friends. Showing Zeke the leaf from the soil, Armin claims that even though he does not need it to live it is still precious to him. He hands Zeke the leaf and is shocked to see the human forms of many past Titan inheritors standing behind him. As Zeke wakes up the inheritors, Armin notices Ymir Fritz watching them from the distance before turning to see Bertolt. Acknowledging his role in Bertolt's death, Armin asks his former ally to help him. Armin is saved from the Titan which kidnapped him by Mikasa, who slices its mouth open. The Titan manages to impale his leg with its tongue and Armin uses a Thunder Spear to kill it, but he begins to get dragged down with its carcass. Connie cuts him free and Annie catches him. Armin explains to his friends that Zeke was able to use the connection all Eldians have to awaken the consciousness of some of the former Nine Titans and theorizes that he was likely able to do so because of Ymir's desire to be connected with others. Their new allies are able to give them the opening necessary to detonate the explosives on Eren's nape. Armin battles Eren Reiner keeps the centipede in Eren's nape from reattaching and the rest of the group flees atop Falco Grice's flying Jaw Titan, clearing the area as Armin prepares to transform. Thanking the Nine Titans who helped him, Armin bids goodbye to Eren and transforms.[207] Emerging from the crater where he transformed, Armin follows Reiner towardsFort Salta, seeking to destroy thesource of all living matter. Shortly after, another massive explosion rocks the plains, and Eren, now controlling the body of a Colossus Titan, emerges from the clouds of steam. Armin turns around to face him, when the source of all living matter suddenly emits a cloud of gas. Armin continues his pace towards Eren, leaving Reiner to deal with the Source. Ignoring the sudden horde of Titans, Armin attempts to grapple Eren, declaring that he will fight him ""until the very end"". Although he lands a hit against Eren's head, he is swiftly disadvantaged when Eren lands a devastating blow against his own head, caving Armin's Titan face in. Despite the melee combat, he hears Mikasa's oath to finish Eren off, assisting by holding Eren's head in place to allow Levi to fire a Thunder Spear towards it. Receiving another crushing blow from Eren that caves in the left side of his Titan's head, Armin's assistance pays off as Mikasa is able to enter the mouth of Eren's Titan and swiftly sever his exposed human head.[208] Armin awakes on the ground outside of his disintegrating Titan, his memories of his and Eren's final conversation restored. As he gets his bearings Mikasa approaches him and Armin is heartbroken to see that she is carrying Eren's decapitated head. As Armin weeps for his friend Mikasa asks if he remembers Eren coming to visit him now and Armin confirms that he does remember: Mikasa's choice to kill Eren has destroyed the Power of the Titans. After Armin has mourned his friend, Mikasa tells him that she is leaving to give Eren a proper burial. The two agree that the best place would be under the tree he used to nap under when he was a child and Mikasa departs. Armin declares that he killed Eren Yeager Armin returns to the rest of the Eldians to find them being held at gunpoint by secretaryMullerand his forces. Muller demands that the Eldians prove that they can no longer turn into Titans or face immediate execution and Armin steps forward in his people's defense. He points out to the Marleyans that if they still possessed the ability to turn into Titans they would be using that very ability to defend themselves. The fact that they are at the Marleyans' mercy must, logically, mean they no longer possess the Power of the Titans. Muller orders his men to lower their firearms and asks for Armin's name. Armin introduces himself as the man who killed Eren Yeager. In the three years following the ""Battle of Heaven and Earth"" at Fort Salta, Armin and the other survivors are appointed as diplomats to facilitate peace talks between the outside world and Paradis. As they are sailing to Paradis to begin the talks the group reads a letter from Historia explaining the current state of Paradis's government. The ambassadors are all skeptical of their mission, but Armin is convinced that the people of Paradis will be willing to listen to reason when they see the Warriors and the Survey Corps, former enemies, working together for a common cause.[201]"
Who is the squad captain of the Special Operations Squad?,Levi,Introduction,"Levi is the squad captain of the Special Operations Squad within the Survey Corps, and is said to be humanity's strongest soldier.

"What is the name of the character who is described as a ""clean freak"" by those who know him personally as he prefers his environment and himself to be spotlessly clean?",Levi,Personality,"As a result of his early childhood years, Levi is described as a ""clean freak"" by those who know him personally as he prefers his environment and himself to be spotlessly clean. He is averse to having either himself or his equipment soiled, and has been known to wipe down his blood-smeared blades while still on the battlefield. However, he will not hesitate to touch filth if he deems it necessary.[22][23] Levi shows his obsession with cleaning Despite his preoccupation with cleanliness, Levi is not very approachable. He rarely shows emotion, giving a cold impression to others. His manner of speaking tends to be very blunt, even insulting, and his comments are often coarse or inappropriate. He is not above provoking or belittling those who oppose or irritate him. His sense of humor tends toward the vulgar, insulting, and dark. All of this makes him unsettling to a great number of people. In his pre-Survey Corps criminal life, when he lived in the Underground City, Levi refused to take orders from anyone , though he placed a great trust in his comrades, something he would later do with his subordinates. However, after he joined theSurvey Corps, he came to greatly respect CommanderErwin Smith, whose orders he follows willingly because he trusts in Erwin's vision for the Corps. Levi's obedience is strictly limited to individuals he respects, and he has no problem showing open disdain for authority from anyone outside of this circle. At Eren's tribunal, he insulted the merchants by calling them ""pigs"" and told theMilitary Policethat they were not competent enough to handle Eren,[24]mocking several MPs by observing that they have never battled or even seen a single Titan. He even sardonically suggests that they join the Survey Corps, which caused them to back off. He openly resents most of the MPs for their continual attempts to undermine the Survey Corps, and also presumably because of the criminal life he led before he joined the Corps. Although he rarely shows it, Levi has a strong sense of morality and empathy. One of his most defining characteristics is the great value he places on preserving human life; this is especially shown when it was revealed that all Titans might have once been human themselves. The thought that he had unknowingly been killing humans all this time disturbs him greatly. Though Levi bore no malice against Eren, he was willing to resort to violence in order to save his life at his tribunal, eventually asking Eren whether he resented him for the beating. Levi himself has stated that he hates unnecessary casualties, and he tells his subordinates to use their judgment so that they can avoid blunders that may cost them their lives. Levi beats up Eren at the military tribunal Because of their hazardous profession and his personal values, he cares greatly for his subordinates' welfare. This is seen several times: when ordered to retreat early toWall Roseat the end of the disastrous 57th Expedition, Levi was visibly distressed that so many of his soldiers had died on a fruitless mission. Later, he risked his life against the Female Titan in order to retrieve Eren from her mouth and also to protect toMikasa, who had gone after her recklessly looking for vengeance. As they re-entered the gate, Petra's father approached him, cheerfully talking about his daughter and her unwavering devotion to the Survey Corps. Unbeknownst to him, his daughter had just been killed; Levi remained silent, he was too overcome with grief to reply. Levi was visibly affected by the loss of his entire originalSpecial Operations Squadat the hands of theFemale Titan, stating that he carries the will of his fallen comrades, and that their collective grudge against the Titans further strengthens his resolve to continue to fight. Despite his obedience to Erwin, Levi operates rather independently. Many of his Titan kills are solo, accomplished with little direct cooperation from other soldiers . Although he is looked up to by many, and he does not hesitate to give orders when necessary, Levi does not see himself as a leader in the same way Erwin is. He does not seem to have much use for hierarchy in general, and he leaves decisions up to his subordinates as often as he can. Though Levi is aware that his battle skill is in a different league from that of almost any other human soldier alive, he is not arrogant about it, as he knows from experience that no human soldier is invulnerable. Few will argue with his claims that only he can handle certain difficult tasks, because he has proven his ability to accomplish them. While Levi shows loyalty and empathy for his comrades, he shows no mercy towards the Titans, slaughtering them indiscriminately with obvious indifference. However, when the Titans are former friends and subordinates, Levi can briefly hesitate and wonder if they are still aware of their actions while trapped inside their Titan forms; regardless, Levi has displayed no problem in killing them. When dealing with individuals he perceives to be enemies to mankind, Levi is capable of behaving sadistically, even vindictively. For example, when the Female Titan was captured, Levi relayed his enjoyment at watching her suffer and described in chilling detail how he intended to mutilate her human body. He has also torturedDjel SanneswithHange Zoë, punching him and twisting his already broken nose. After defeating Zeke Yeager a second time, he sadistically made it clear that he was going to torture Zeke for his crimes against Paradis and the Survey Corps, impaling him with aThunder Spear. Levi displays no emotion during these times aside from bloodlust, shown by his methodically slicing apart Zeke's legs.[25] Levi is occasionally known to lose his calm demeanor and to use threats or violence to get others to listen to him, even if they are fellow members of the corps. An example of such behavior was shown when he directly orderedHistoria Reissto take on the role of queen when the question was presented to her. When she shakily says she is unfit, he grabs her and lifts her off the ground, choking her and telling her to fight back if she does not like it. He then drops her and yells at her to make her decision, but is however calm once again when she complies with his demands.[26]"
What was Levi's mother's name?,Kuchel Ackerman,History,"A young Levi and Kenny met Levi was born the son ofKuchel Ackerman, a prostitute who worked in theUndergroundand was made pregnant by one of her clients. One day,Kenny Ackerman, Kuchel's older brother, came to the city to see her only to find that she was dead.[27]There, he found a young and squalid Levi sitting in front of his mother's bed. In a rare showing of compassion, Kenny decided to take care of him. He raised Levi as well as he could: teaching him knife skills, how to get along with people, and violent behavior. Levi also learned to use his own inner power that he possessed as a member of the Ackerman clan.[28] Following his mother's death, Levi attempted to steal back a tea set she had sold in order to pay for food. He was caught in the act and the merchants, after apprehending him, considered selling him into slavery. Levi, disgusted by their behavior, attempted to resist and was nearly beaten to death. However, before the merchants could finish him off hisAckerman bloodawakened and he killed all of them in a moment of blind rage. After calming down, he was confronted by the sole surviving merchant who attempted to blackmail Levi into sparing his by arguing that his friends would hunt Levi down and kill him in retribution unless he left the merchant alive to talk them down. Levi simply retorted that no one would believe that a child had killed them before throwing the merchant to his death. Returning to his home, Levi made himself a cup of tea using her set. However, when he attempted to drink it the handle broke, causing him to drop and shatter the cup. From that point on, Levi refused to hold cups by their handles, choosing to hold them by their brims instead.[29] Time passed and eventually, Kenny taught Levi everything he knew. However, he did not consider himself as a good father figure.[30][31]One day, in the subterranean city, Levi started a fight which he won easily. At that moment, Kenny decided to leave him behind, satisfied that he had taught Levi the skills he needed to survive.[32] Later, he became a notorious thug in the underground but eventually left the place to join theSurvey Corps.[3]Although at one point he was at odds withErwin Smith,[33]he ended up becoming one of his most trusted men."
What is the name of the old Survey Corps HQ inside Wall Rose?,Special Operations Squad,The female titan arc,"After Eren issues a verbal challenge to the audience during his trial, Levi violently beats him on the spot, mockingly observing that while chained on his knees, Eren is perfectly placed for his kicks. Armin has to restrain an infuriated Mikasa from coming to Eren's rescue and killing Levi. She glares at Levi after the trial, seemingly unnerving him. Unknown to Mikasa, the beating was an act in defense of Eren that gave the impression that despite Eren's fearsome Titan powers, Levi could still control him.[38] Levi attempts to calm his squad down After the trial, Levi hands Eren over to hisSpecial Operations Squadfor the next month. They move into the old Survey Corps HQ insideWall Rose. Levi orders Eren to sleep in the castle dungeon so that if he accidentally transforms, he will not cause problems.[39]During this month, Hange conducts experiments to try to get Eren to transform. If Eren goes out of control in Titan form, Levi intends to cut him out of the nape in a manner that would sever his human limbs, which would grow back in any case. However, Eren fails to transform, and his hands do not heal from his bites. The Squad decides to postpone any further experiments.[40] One day, while having tea with them, Eren leans over to pick up a spoon and accidentally generates a partial Titan body. The alarmed Squad threatens him, and Levi has to defuse the situation.[41]Levi tells Eren not to take their actions personally, and that they have good intentions. Later, after Hange explains why Eren triggered his Titan form, Levi's entire squad punishes themselves, and apologizes to Eren for acting on assumption.[42] During the 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls, Levi and his team are ordered to ride in the safest area of Erwin's formation. When the formation is suddenly attacked by a horde of Titans coming at their right flank, they change course toward theTitan Forest, and Levi's squad takes the central route.[43] Once theFemale Titanappears, his squad begs Levi to give them orders, but he continues to ride forward and look straight ahead.[44]Eren badly wants to transform and fight the Female Titan, but Petra and her comrades urge him to trust them, and Eren hesitates.[45]Levi tells Eren that he is not wrong for wanting to transform and that nobody can know the correct choice until after they have made it. Whatever Eren chooses to do, Levi says, he should do it and believe he will not regret it. Eren then declares that he trusts completely in his squad's victory, and they keep going through the Forest.[46][47]This enables the Survey Corps to capture the Female Titan.[48] Levi and Mike try to attack the Female Titan Shortly afterward, Levi gets separated from his squad. He reunites with Erwin and prepares to extract the human in control of the Female Titan from the nape of her neck.[49]He and Mike attack her and try to cut her hands, only to discover her ability to harden her skin.[50]After Erwin orders the cannons to be loaded with explosives and aimed at the Female Titan's wrists, Levi, standing on her head, taunts her with threats of violence, telling her he would like to face her in her human form over the deaths of countless of his soldiers. In response, the Female Titan begins to roar.[51]Shortly after, Titans come at her from all directions and devour her. On Erwin's order, Levi and the rest of the Survey Corps elite try to protect her from them, but they fail due to the sheer number of Titans. Erwin orders the Corps to retreat back to theKaranes District.[52][53]However, Erwin notes that the steam from the Titan bodies will make it difficult for the rest of the Survey Corps to see the signal flares. He then realizes that the human inside the Female Titan may have escaped, and he orders Levi to replenish his gas canisters and blades.[54] After the Female Titan returns and kills Levi's entire squad and captures Eren, he and Mikasa join forces to rescue him. Levi tells Mikasa to distract the Titan but avoid trying to kill her, since she is able to harden her skin.[55]Levi then proceeds to attack the Female Titan, and after a series of successful attacks, he incapacitates her. Seeing that the Female Titan is now helpless, Mikasa disobeys Levi's orders and attempts to kill the person inside the Titan. However, the Female Titan swings her hardened fist at Mikasa, and Levi is forced to pull Mikasa out of the way. While doing this, Levi injures his left leg.[56]Using the momentum he gained from the last attack, Levi then proceeds to cuts through the Female Titan's facial muscles, causing her to open her mouth and release Eren. He grabs Eren and flees with Mikasa, whom he reprimands for having risked the life of her ""special friend"" for the sake of vengeance.[57]As he leaves, he takes one more look at the beaten Female Titan and is visibly surprised to see it crying. Levi's reaction to the words of Petra's father As they enter Karanes after retreating, the Survey Corps receives a hostile response from the public for their failed mission. Levi is approached by Petra's father, who reveals that she wrote to him frequently. He tells Levi that, as a father, he is worried about Petra's decision to dedicate her life to him, as she is still quite young and has her whole life ahead of her. Levi continues to walk silently ahead without responding.[58]A few days later, Eren is summoned tothe Capitolfor a trial to decide his fate. Beforehand, Levi, Erwin, Eren, and the other survivors reunite in the old Survey Corps HQ. Armin tells them his theory about the Female Titan's true identity.[59]Levi, still injured, does not participate in the subsequent operation in theStohess District; during this part of the arc he is only seen with Erwin.[60]"
Who does Eren ask to tell him everything he knows about his father?,Instructor Keith Shadisis,Return to shiganshina arc,"Levi remarks that Keith had changed a lot The next morning, InstructorKeith Shadisis visited at the training camp byEren,Hange,Mikasa,Armin,Jean,Sasha, and Levi. The reason for this is that Eren now remembers a past memory where his fatherDr. Yeagermet Keith after the massacre in theReiss familychapel. Eren asks Keith to tell him everything he knows about his father, and they go to a house to talk. Levi remarks that Keith has changed a lot since they last met, remembering his head full of hair and then looking at his now bald scalp.[112] Keith starts by warning them that he knows nothing of Grisha's secrets, but anyway recounts to them all his experiences with him ever since they met 20 years ago, until the day of the fall ofWall Mariaafter Keith found Eren unconscious in a forest after receiving the Coordinate. A furious Hange tells him that he is not the one who decides if that information is valuable or not and reprimands him for not saying anything about it to the Survey Corps before, prompting Levi to tell Hange to stop. Hange continues to chastise him and is only silenced when they are again asked to stop by Eren.[113] Levi threatens to break both of Erwin's legs During a meeting with other members of theSurvey Corps, Levi sits silently and listens to Hange tell Erwin what Keith Shadis explained to them on their visit. After the meeting is finished, Levi waits until all the other members have left and then shuts the door, intent on having a private conversation with Erwin. He tries to persuade Erwin to sit out on the upcoming mission to retake Wall Maria and to leave it to the others, telling him that in his weakened state, Erwin will simply be Titan food and that he is not willing to carry along any extra baggage. Erwin however explains to Levi that the chain of command must be preserved, and that he has an intense desire to see what is in Grisha'sbasement, which prompts Levi to threaten to break both of his legs. However, this does not deter Erwin and Levi realizes that he will unfortunately not be able to change Erwin's mind, even though he fears his death as a wounded soldier.[114] Squad Levi advances towards Shiganshina District Late that night at a special 'red meat' dinner, Levi briefly attended with Erwin and Hange[115], later breaking up a fight between Eren and Jean by kicking and throwing them both into submission. He then orders that they and the rest of the Corps to go back to their quarters and go to bed. Shortly after, Eren, Armin and Mikasa talk about their returning home and Levi listens to them while in the barn. As he hears Armin's ambitions, his expression is lowered and darkened.[116] The next day, just before sunset, Levi along with the other Survey Corps leaders salute the higher-ups of the brass, includingDarius ZacklyandCommander Pixis. Levi watches on as the citizens of theTrost Districtcheer for the Survey Corps and call out his name. He acts modest and calls them selfish before seeing Erwin cheer back at the enthusiastic civilians. Right after, the 58th expedition begins, Levi rides out with the Corps at Erwin's side as he glances back at Eren and Mikasa.[117] Near dawn, the Survey Corps walk on foot through a forest on a mountain, leading theirhorses. Levi questions a subordinate, asking if they are still not at the bottom of the mountain, worrying that it is almost dawn. AsSquad Levitalk among themselves,Jeanspots a Titan andHangeorders the Corps to halt and illuminate the area, using fragments from the cave below theReiss Chapel. Hange then states that the Titan is asleep, and the Corps continue.[118]Eventually, they reachShiganshina Districtand ride in on their horses. Erwin orders the soldiers to be wary of hidden Titans and then orders them to switch tovertical maneuvering equipmentand begin the mission. The soldiers leave their horses and rush toward the gate to Shiganshina. As Eren arrives atop the inner Wall, he stares at the ruins of his home town. He is quickly urged on by Levi to get to the outer gate and the two take off.[119]As per the plan, 100 soldiers covered by hoods rush to the outer gate to confuse any watching enemies, making sure they do not know which soldier is Eren. Hange and Levi wonder why there are no Titans in the area and Levi claims that they have fallen right into the enemy's hands. However, the two agree that they must go forward with the plan anyway as Eren flies up above the gate and prepares totransform.[120]After Eren successfully seals the hole in the Wall, Levi reminds him that they have to kill all of their enemies, includingReinerandBertoltbefore their mission will truly be finished.[121] Levi goes for the kill on Reiner When Reiner is discovered by one of the Survey Corps members and attempts to attack Armin, Levi attacks Reiner, shoving his blade through the nape of his neck and stabbing him, before kicking him to the ground. After seeing that Reiner survived the brutal attack, Levi angrily laments that he was not able to kill Reiner. While on the ground, Reiner shifts into his Titan form. Levi makes his way back to Erwin's side, where the latter begins issuing commands. He tasks Levi with helping to protect thehorses, believing that Levi is the only soldier he can trust to take out theBeast Titan. He arrives first, out of the two squads sent, and immediately kills two Titans,[8]ordering the soldiers under his command that they cannot die. After Bertolt is thrown over the Wall and transforms, Levi and his soldiers are bombarded by a barrage of stones and boulders from the Beast Titan. They retreat to the Wall where Erwin meets them. Levi asks about Eren and Squad Hange's well-being, and Erwin informs the soldiers of their increasingly desperate situation. As the young recruits fall into a panic, Levi asks Erwin if he has some kind of plan.[122] Regarding the situation, Levi gives Erwin the advice to save as many lives as possible by ""loading them on Eren"" to make an escape.[123]Levi continues by saying that he will fight the Beast Titan. Although Levi knows that there is little chance of a victory, he deduces that there is still hope for the Survey Corps if Erwin and Eren survive. But for Levi to take down the Beast Titan, Erwin must sacrifice himself and his men. At this point, Erwin is melancholic, but Levi makes the decision and swears that he will take down the Beast Titan after telling his commander that he must die for them.[124]In an attempt to get closer to the Beast Titan, Levi uses the line of Titans around him to his advantage while in an open space. To his side, he notices Erwin's men following closely behind, fear-stricken as they ride toward their death.[125] Levi shoves his sword through Zeke's head After Erwin and most of the Survey Corps fall when charging the Beast Titan, Levi takes out the surrounding Titans and engages Zeke. After realizing what has happened, Zeke attempts to crush Levi, who merely dodges, slicing up the Titan's arm to pieces in the process. Levi then proceeds to slash the Beast Titan's eyes, blinding it, then cuts up its ankles which causes it to topple over. Slicing open the nape, Levi thrusts his blade into Zeke's mouth, commenting that his body is heavily damaged after transforming into a Titan so Zeke can not transform again while he is busy healing it. Further thrusting his blade right through Zeke's cheek and above his right eye, Levi decides he cannot kill him yet, pondering over whether there are anyone still alive who he would use theTitan injectionon and have them eat Zeke to steal his Titan power. However, Levi is interrupted and shocked when theCart Titansnatches Zeke and carries him away in its mouth. Zeke then orders the remaining Titans to kill Levi, but Levi, remembering his promise to Erwin, finds his resolve and begins to take on the Titans and chase down Zeke.[126] Levi pursues Zeke and the Cart Titan back to Shiganshina District, where he is stopped by his lack of supplies. He orders Eren to give him all his gas and blades so that he can continue the chase, but Eren panics and demands that Levi give Armin, who has been mortally wounded, the Titan injection he is carrying. Levi hesitates, but agrees. Just as he is about to hand Eren the injection,a recruitcrawls up onto the roof with Erwin, who is on the brink of death. Levi decides that he will give it to Erwin instead of Armin, which enrages Eren.[127] Levi punches Eren for his insubordination over the serum Appalled at Eren and Mikasa, Levi reminds them of how important Erwin's survival is, and orders them not to let their feelings bias their decision. When Eren refuses to step down, Levi forcefully punches his face and knocks him aside, before being pinned down by an enraged Mikasa. Eren and Mikasa try to convince Levi of Armin's value, while Floch argues that Levi is correct to save Erwin, and a fight between them is only narrowly avoided by the arrival of Hange, who pulls Mikasa off of Levi. Levi prepares to inject Erwin, but is given pause by Eren, who tries to sway Levi by telling him of Armin's dream to see the ocean. Levi orders his comrades to leave him alone while he injects Erwin.[128] As Levi prepares to inject Erwin, he recalls Armin's conversation with Eren and Mikasa about the ocean, and Erwin's dream to see the secrets locked in Eren's basement. As he begins injecting Erwin, Levi recalls Kenny's final words about people becoming slaves to their own desires, and is surprised when Erwin lashes out in his sleep, knocking away the syringe. As he watches Erwin, Levi recalls his order to Erwin to give up on his dreams and die with the rest of the Survey Corps' recruits, and the look of relief on Erwin's face at the order.[129] Levi sits with a dying Erwin After injecting Armin, Levi watches as Armin's mindless Titan form devours Bertolt, and explains to a confused Floch that, after all he has given, it is time for Erwin to finally rest. Levi attempts to apologize to Erwin for failing to kill the Beast Titan, but Hange informs him that Erwin has already died.[130] On top of the Wall, Levi notices thatArminhas awoken. He fires asignal flarefor the soldiers to regroup. He orders Eren to tell Armin about the events that occurred in the past few hours. Armin shows remorse for the measures his comrades have taken for him, but Levi advocates that he should not be regretful. Afterward, Levi followsEren,Mikasa, andHangeto theYeager family'sbasement. When the group find that Eren's key cannot open the locked door, Levi proceeds to kick the door open. They inspect the basement thoroughly and Mikasa finds a drawer which needs Eren's key to unlock. Initially empty, Levi discovers a false bottom and under it are three hidden books kept intact with various preservatives. They open the first book and within it they find an uncannily realistic portrait of Grisha standing beside a fair-haired woman and a child. On the back of it, Grisha had written that it is not an illustration; it is called a photograph and humanity has not perished.[131] While serving their punishment in jail cells, Mikasa and Eren discuss the journals and Grisha's memories until Hange, Levi, and Armin interrupt Eren and provoke them about what they were talking about until Levi accuses him of going through a phase as a teenager and lets them go, claiming that their sentence is being cut short because of their low numbers and their superiors failure to catch the Armored and Beast Titans.[132]The group, now with Jean, meet Historia afterward to speak with her after she finishes reading a letter left to her by Ymir. After the meeting, everyone, including all other military commanders and officials, meet to discuss the recent expedition, the journals, and the huge loss of life.[133] Once the information obtained from Eren's basement is released to the world, Hange and Levi meet withRoyandPeaureto discuss the revelations and how the public are handling it.[134] The royal government plans for the Survey Corps to be awarded with medals in a ceremony for their bravery and success. Over hearing a fight breaking out among the younger recruits, Levi cuts in to stop them and tell them to prepare for the beginning of the ceremony. A military audience gathers in a large room where Historia presents each of the nine soldiers with a medal of honor in the form of a dark bolo tie with the wings of freedom on it.[135] Months later, in the summer season, Shiganshina District is once again populated with people as all the Titans had been cleared out. Finally, the Survey Corps once again ventures outside of Wall Maria on an expedition for the first time in six years. They find a trail left by a Titan crawling along the ground, and follow it until they reach the edge of Paradis Island. Here, the Survey Corps sees the ocean for the first time.[136]Jean, Connie, and Sasha begin splashing and playing while Hange gleefully picks up never-before-seen ocean materials such as coral much to Levi's dismay, as he attempts to caution them against touching the water.[137]"
Who is the ambassador from the nation of Hizurunamed Kiyomi Azumabito?,Hizurunamed Kiyomi Azumabito,Marley arc,"Levi learns Yelena and Onyankopon's mission One year after theBattle of Shiganshina District, Levi and other members of the Survey Corps make contact with theAnti-Marleyan Volunteers,YelenaandOnyankopon, who rebel against the rest of theMarleyancrew on their ship. The two defectors show Levi and Hange their technology, and Levi is concerned by how greatly Hange is impressed with Marley's level of advancement. He asks if the defectors would notify Marley that they have eliminated all the Titans on the island, but Yelena says they would not. They are here under orders from Zeke to free the Eldian people.[138] Levi attends the military meeting to decide whether to cooperate with Zeke and the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers. Though he does not voice an opinion, he asks Eren why he withheld the information that he could control theFounding Titan's power if he is in contact with a royal-blooded Titan. Not wanting to disrupt the meeting, Levi tells Eren they will discuss this later.[139]Once the Survey Corps agrees to work with Yelena and Onyankopan, Levi assists them in capturing the soldiers sent on future Marleyan expeditions.[140] A year later, Levi and Hange take the Survey Corps to meet with an ambassador from the nation ofHizurunamedKiyomi Azumabito. While waiting for Kiyomi to arrive, Yelena attempts to interact with Eren, but Levi separates them, insisting that Yelena not be allowed near him.[141] In 853, Levi and Hange receive word from Hizuru saying that they will be unable to help Eldia trade with the outside world and relay the news to Levi's squad. Levi, Hange and the Scouts decide to journey to Marley's mainland to meet with Kiyomi.[142]At the Azumabito estate, Levi listens on as Kiyomi discusses the unlikeliness of Eldia forming friendly relationships with other countries. Hange decides the Scouts must remain undercover and place their faith in the ""Association to protect the Subjects of Ymir"" speaking at an international forum the following day. Later on in the day Levi, Hange and Onyankopon find the rest of the Scouts passed out after partying with a refugee family. The soldiers sit in on a speech by the Association discussing the mistreatment of displaced Subjects of Ymir. They are horrified when the speaker begins calling for the hatred being shown towards Eldians worldwide to be redirected towards the Eldians living on Paradis. Eren slinks off during the hearing, and later sends letters to the Scouts, informing them of his intention to trust Zeke and attackLiberio.[143] Levi squares off against the Jaw Titan In 854, Levi later participates in the infiltration intoMarleyand the ensuingRaid on Liberio. After theJaw Titansneaks behind and jumps on the back of theAttack Titan, Levi takes note and goes to intercept it. The Jaw Titan tries to bite into the neck of the Attack Titan, but Levi severs the muscles in the left side of its face, rendering it unable to rip out the nape. Then both Levi and Mikasa engage it, along with many other members of the Survey Corps. TheCart Titan's Panzer Unit makes a surprise attack, eliminating many of the Corps and forcing them to fall back. Noticing the sudden arrival of Zeke Yeager's Beast Titan, Levi orders the surviving soldiers to regroup and stares down the Beast Titan.[144] Levi takes down the Beast Titan Levi is on standby as the Beast Titan sends debris flying into the surrounding area. He observes as the Titan calls for him to come out, and later ambushes it by quickly slicing its nape, knocking it down. Levi proceeds to cut Zeke out of his Titan form and, before grappling away, throws a bomb into the Beast Titan's nape, detonating it and demoralizing the Marley troops with the presumed death of their Warchief.[145] As the Survey Corps retreat, Levi helps Eren aboard the airship and then kicks him into the wall and places him under arrest.[146]He takes Eren to a back room where Zeke and his attendantYelenaare. Both he and Zeke exchange insults whentwostowawaysare brought to them; he listens to Hange and silently agrees when Hange states that Eren made the entire Paradis Island a target due to his actions in Marley.[147] Once they return to the island, Levi rides into the city in a carriage with Zeke. He mock threatens to kill Zeke, send his corpse back to Marley, and then reveal everything about his plot, which would spell the end for hisgrandparents. However, Levi admits as long as Zeke's ""secret plan"" is real, he is willing to wait a little longer before slicing him to pieces.[148]"

Zeke.,[1].,War for paradis arc,"Levi escorts Zeke to a Titan Forest with a number of soldiers explaining that it will not be easy for him to escape from such an environment. Zeke asks Levi if he can show the trees to Gabi and Falco, but Levi responds that it depends on his own actions.[149]Despite his reservations, Levi is convinced by his subordinates to allow them to drink wine imported from Marley while they are guarding Zeke in the forest.[150] Levi remembers his comrades Zeke later tells Levi about the method he had used to turn the people ofRagakointo Titans. After the explanation finishes, Levi admonishes Zeke for his lack of guilt, and tells him that he clearly has no concern for human life. He is shaken off and told not to assume how he felt. Zeke changes the subject by asking when he will be allowed to carry out his experiment with Eren. Levi tells him that this is not his call, but both agree that it would be a mistake to wait around too long.[151] After a Survey Corps messenger arrives at the camp,Varisnotifies Levi thatDarius Zacklyhas been assassinated and also informs him of CommanderPixis's plan to deal with theYeagerists. Dismayed to hear that his friends and comrades have essentially died for nothing to protect Eren, Levi tells them they are altering the plan. He suggests they capture one of the Yeagerists and force them to eat Zeke; then whenHistoriagives birth several months from now and is ready to inherit, they will feed the Yeagerist to her. Levi orders Varis to go inform Pixis and descends from the tree. Despite the holes in this plan, Levi admits to himself that he does not care about Pixis's reply.[152] Titans rain down on Levi After trading a few barbs with Zeke, Levi gets lost in his thoughts. He considers how he will soon fulfill the vow he made to Erwin during the Battle of Shiganshina and give meaning to his deceased comrades. Turning around, he notices Zeke running into the forest; before Levi can react, however, Zeke lets out a piercing scream. He looks on in horror as the numerous Survey Corps soldiers above him begin to fall out of the trees and transform into Titans.[153]Levi is caught off guard but comes to his senses in time to avoid one of the Titans charging him. Remembering how his subordinates insisted they enjoy the wine offered and Zeke's comment on it from earlier, Levi theorizes that the wine was indeed the likely cause of the soldiers transforming.[154]Noticing these Titans are faster and more unpredictable, he reflects on if his subordinates are still inside and conscious of their actions. As the Titans swarm around him in midair, Levi closes his eyes.[155] Levi glares at a horrified Zeke Levi slaughters his former subordinates and collects several Thunder Spears before chasing down Zeke. Catching up with him, Levi kills one of Zeke's three Titan escorts and meets Zeke's gaze with a murderous look. Levi quickly dispatches another of the Titans before Zeke transforms into the Beast Titan.[156]As Zeke butchers the final Titan and throws the bloody pieces at him, Levi dodges Zeke's attack while chopping up large tree branches to hide himself in mid-air. He criticizes Zeke for not anticipating that he would be capable of killing his fellow soldiers.[157] Levi curses Zeke as he cuts him out of the Beast Titan Falling towards Zeke, Levi fires and hits Zeke's nape with four Thunder Spears before quickly detonating them. Cutting Zeke's mangled and burned body from his Titan form, Levi insults him before dragging him out of the forest.[158]When the tied up Zeke awakens inside a horse-drawn cart, Levi instructs him to not move, revealing that he has placed the tip of a Thunder Spear inside his stomach and attached the fuse around his neck. Levi chastises Zeke for killing his men, before starting to cut off chunks of his legs. Hearing Zeke scream, Levi shouts at him to shut up, explaining that this has to be done to prevent him from becoming a Titan. Zeke weakly asks where his glasses are but Levi brushes it aside, stating he would no longer be needing them.[159] Hange finds Levi While Levi steers the cart, Zeke begins muttering about his plan to euthanize Eldia in order to ensure the world's safety. Hearing this, Levi begins mocking him, saying that his impending death at the hands of a Titan is too merciful when considering the lives he has taken. Zeke weakly protests that he was saving their children from living in a cruel world, prompting Levi to angrily prepare to cut off his legs again. Terrified, Zeke pulls the pin on the Thunder Spear lodged in his stomach; a shocked Levi is unable to react and is caught in the resulting explosion.[160]The two of them are launched from the cart, and Levi is sent hurling towards a nearby river.[161] Levi's unconscious body is found shortly afterwards by Hange and a group of Yeagerists. When a soldier suggests shooting Levi, Hange insists that he is already dead, prompting Floch to request that he be allowed to check for a pulse.[162]Before Floch can check, he is distracted by the sight of Zeke emerging from a nearby Titan, allowing Hange to grab Levi's body and dive into the river to escape.[163] Since he was near Zeke when the Thunder Spear was activated, Levi's face is severely scarred by the resulting debris; in addition, Levi also lost two of the fingers on his right hand. Levi is eventually awakened from his coma by a message sent by Eren to all Subjects of Ymir announcing his intentions to destroy the world outside of Paradis. The two resolve to find a way to stop Eren, and Hange creates a makeshift transport for Levi to be moved in.[164] Levi declares his intention to kill Zeke As Levi is being transported, they cross paths with the Cart Titan and aMarleyan general. Hange approaches the two, insisting that they and Levi are harmless.[165]Levi negotiates with the soldiers, pointing out that they have a common goal in killing Zeke. Reluctantly, the soldiers agree to work together.[166] During the nightfall en route to harbor, Levi attempts to rest but is awakened by the commotion being made by the others in the camp.[167] After daybreak, Levi would stay behind with the noncombatants as his allies confront the Yeagerists at the harbor.[168]Having decided to transport theflying boatto the Marleyan coastal city ofOdiha, Levi and the others head towards theAzumabito's ship on top of the Cart Titan.[169] After arriving in Odiha, Armin finds Levi walking despite his injuries. Levi refuses to rest any longer and insists on interrogating Yelena about Eren's next destination. Yelena claims that Eren is going toFort Salta, but Levi is concerned by her sudden cooperation. Levi bids farewell to Hange As the group prepares to depart Odiha, Levi prepares himself for battle despite his injuries; when the others wonder how he will able to fight with only two fingers on one hand, Levi brushes their concerns aside and merely states he will manage fine. He ridicules Hange for failing to make friends with Pieck, but becomes concerned when his commander begins musing about their fallen comrades. Preparations are interrupted by Floch, who arrives in the flying boat's hangar damaging its fuel tank, necessitating repairs. Eren's Titans arrive as the repairs are being made and Hange volunteers to hold them off while the ship departs. Levi stops Hange only long enough to tell them to dedicate their heart.[170] Levi and the group is suddenly pulled intoPathsby Eren. Levi and the others attempt to reason with Eren to stop the rumbling, however Eren informs the group that he called them into Paths to let them know that they will have to kill him to stop the Rumbling, before sending them back to the flying boat.[171] As the flying boat reaches Eren it comes under fire from the Beast Titan. Levi and his comrades jump from the boat and use their maneuvering gear to evade the Beast's projectiles before engaging it directly.[172]The Beast is quickly defeated, but Zeke is nowhere to be found. The group decides to retreat to a safe distance so Armin can transform and try to uncover Zeke with the blast, but the plan is interrupted when an army of Titans begins generating on Eren's back and absconds with Armin. Levi reassures his team that Armin is unhurt, as he would have transformed otherwise, and begins devising a plan to act as bait for the Titans while the rest of the group tries to save him. Pieck attempts to kill Eren but is defeated by the Titans, and Levi orders the remaining soldiers to pursue Armin as he is their only hope of stopping more Titans from appearing. The group does not make it far before Bertolt's Colossus Titan appears. The Colossus disables Reiner's Titan and then throws it at the group, knocking them off Eren's Titan. Levi is left too injured by the impact to move, but manages to use the last of his strength to save Connie from being devoured by a Titan. However, his leg is caught in the Titan's jaw and Mikasa is forced to save him. Passing out from pain, Levi begins to fall and is only saved when Connie manages to catch him. The entire group is saved by the timely arrival of Falco, who has learned to fly with his Jaw Titan form.[173] A disagreement begins atop Falco's Titan over whether to attack Eren's nape or save Armin first and Levi makes the decision to split up and do both. Mikasa tries to protest, but Levi insists that they are no longer in a position where they can care about Eren's well-being. As his allies disembark Falco to begin their objectives, Levi laments the fact that he is too injured to help. As he reflects on his inability to carry out Erwin's final order and kill Zeke, Levi begins to wonder why his comrades all dedicated themselves to the Survey Corps' mission. As he remembers his comrades, Levi asserts that he does not regret saving Armin's life over Erwin's, since Armin has always had the same look in his eyes that his fallen comrades did.[174] Levi decapitates Zeke As he observes the battle from Falco's Titan Levi is perplexed to see a handful of the Titans begin to defend his comrades from the rest of the Titans. He is immediately brought out of his stupor by the sight of Zeke emerging from Eren's spine and calling out to him. Without hesitation, Levi decapitates Zeke before returning to Falco.[175] The group returns to Salta while Armin transforms atop Eren's Titan. From the fort they are relieved to see that Reiner has survived, but are dismayed to see that both Eren and thesource of all living matterhave survived as well. Connie suggests killing the source, but Levi insists that they have been left with no other option than to kill Eren. Before they can attack Eren again, the source begins emitting smoke that billows into the fort. Realizing that the smoke is going to transform the Eldians present into Titans, Levi quickly orders Mikasa and Pieck to leave the fort with him on Falco so that they are not put in danger by the Titans. Pieck departs to help Reiner fight the centipede while Falco takes Levi and Mikasa directly to Eren. Mikasa deduces that Eren is inside his Titan's mouth and Levi uses a Thunder Spear to make a way for her to get inside and kill him.[176] As the power of the Titans is undone and the Eldian families begin to reunite with each other, Levi rests against a rock. He sees a vision of his fallen comrades watching him and asks if they were able to see the result of their work. The soldiers salute him in response and Levi returns the salute. In the three years following the battle at Salta, Levi takes up residence in Marley. His injuries leave him permanently wheelchair-bound and he is attended to by Gabi and Falco.[177]"
What was Erwin's ultimate goal?,humanity to once again rise up and become the dominant species over the Titans,Personality,"Erwin was a complex character, portrayed as serious, calculating, and always planning far in the future. While he trusted his men, he was the first to realize that there was a spy interfering with theSurvey Corps, and was able to come up with a reasonable criteria to determine which of his soldiers to trust with vital information, and which to keep in the dark. An eloquent speaker, Erwin was able to sway many people, such as themilitarytribunal held to judgeErenand thetraineesinto choosing which recruitment branches to join. Erwin was often seen as a very grim individual. He accepted all news, good or bad, mockery or praise, with the same stoic attitude. His ultimate goal was for humanity to once again rise up and become the dominant species over theTitans, a goal he was willing to sacrifice anything for, such as when ordering everyone to save Eren even after being caught in the jaws of a Titan, resulting in the loss of his right arm.[6] He shared this unique stoic quality with men such asGarrisonCommanderDot Pixis, team leaderIan Dietrich, and Commander-in-ChiefDarius Zackly. AsArmin Arlertput it, Erwin, like the aforementioned three men, had the ability to send his men to die if it would further the cause of humanity. He and they would sacrifice their own humanity in order to bring change to a world where those who cannot sacrifice things important to them will not change anything. Since he was able to make such commitments, he was a master strategist, shown multiple times through actions like capturing theFemale Titanand leading a group of Titans to distract theArmored Titanso the military could save Eren. However, behind his front of assurance and single-minded determination, Erwin still held his own personal ideals and questioned his own motivations. Following the rebellion, he admitted he understood his audacious actions and questioned constantly if what he was doing was the right thing.[7]Darius Zackly and Dot Pixis were also privy to this, with Zackly hypothesizing that Erwin did not truly care about humanity's best interests,[8]and Pixis openly accusing Erwin of caring more about his own life than the survival of humanity as a whole.[9] These views of Erwin proved, in the long run, to be true. During his final expedition inShiganshina, when faced with the prospect of sacrificing his own life in order to defeat theBeast Titan, Erwin proved reluctant to act, even considering abandoning his comrades for a slim chance of reaching the basement. Only after being coerced byLevidid he reveal his strategy. He cared more about discovering the secrets hidden in Eren'sbasementand finally provinghis father's theories correct - possibly as a means to alleviate his guilt for the part he played in his death - than he did about retaking the lost territory ofWall Maria. His dream of understanding the world was so strong that he confessed to Levi that he considered it more important than the victory of humanity.[10] This selfishness should not, however, be mistaken for heartlessness. He felt great remorse for sacrificing countless others for the sake of his ambitions, admitting to Levi that he felt their fallen comrades watching him, waiting to see what he would do with the lives that they dedicated to him.[11]This had rendered him suicidal; only his obsession with learning the truth about the world pushed him forward. Furthermore, despite his desire to understand the truth of the world being stronger than humanity's victory, Erwin made the selfless decision to go charging in the front lines alongside his soldiers and sacrifice the chance of knowing what was in the basement, effectively abandoning his dream.[12]"
What did Erwin do in his father's class?,asked a question,History,"Erwin asked a question in his father's class As a child, Erwin was a curious and insightful individual who did not accept facts at face value. He asked why humanity had no memory of what happened before they lived within theWalls, because even if they had lost all their records, the first generation should have been able to teach their children. Hisfathershared a theory with him that thekinghad altered humanity's memories when they first entered the Walls so he could control them better. Too innocent to realize why his father would not discuss this in the classroom, Erwin shared it with the other kids in town, which resulted in his father's ""accidental"" death, arranged by the Military Police Brigade'sFirst Interior Squad.[13][14] Erwin later enlisted in theTraining Corpswhere he became friends withNile Dok, with whom he shared his theory about theRoyal Governmenthiding the truth about the world.[15]The two of them planned to enter theSurvey Corpstogether, but they fell in love with the same woman at their favorite bar. Erwin gave up on a relationship withMarieso he could continue pursuing the truth and Nile changed his plans to marry her.[16] Erwin shared his theories with his friends After graduating, Erwin joined the Survey Corps, where he stopped sharing his theory with others. He realized that everyone else was fighting for the sake of humanity, whereas he was only fighting for himself. Nonetheless, he thrived as a soldier and eventually was given subordinates under his command.[17] While a Squad Leader, Erwin devised theLong-Distance Enemy Scouting Formationas a way to minimize casualties while on expeditions. His proposal was rejected by then CommanderKeith Shadis, who told him to try it when he became commander himself. Although his proposal had been rejected, Erwin began implementing his strategies in his own squad, and over time other soldiers and the populace began to notice that his squad would take no casualties, whereas Shadis would often be the only survivor of his charges.[18]"
Where does Erwin take the key to Eren's basement?,to Eren'sbasement,Wall sealing arc,"In the year 850, Erwin leads an expedition beyond Wall Rose. While the Survey Corps is clearing a town inside Wall Maria, it is discovered that Titans are moving north, towards theTrost Districtof Wall Rose, and Erwin orders a retreat.[21] Once arrived, the Corps narrowly saves a trapped Eren,Armin, andMikasaafter their mission to block the hole is complete.[22] Erwin shows Eren the key to his basement Erwin next appears whenErenrecovers from his three day coma and is kept in a jail cell beneath themilitarycourt. He explains to Eren that hisTitan powershave caused an uproar within the Walls. He has taken the key to Eren'sbasementand asks if the secret to Titans is located in the basement, to which Eren replies that he believes so. Erwin then formulates a plan to use Eren'sTitanform to retake Wall Maria so they can investigate the basement.[23]"
"Who does Erwin apologize to for Levi's treatment of him before commending him for unwittingly giving them the perfect argument to convince the military to turn him over to the corps, formally welcoming him to the Survey Corps?",Eren,The female titan arc,"Erwin is present at Eren's trial Erwin attends the military's tribunal to determine what to do with Eren Yeager, proposing to the military's commander-in-chiefDarius Zacklythat the boy be entrusted to the Survey Corps so that his powers can be used to reclaim Wall Maria. In the middle of the trial Eren loses his temper, prompting Levi to beat him in front of everyone to prove that he can be controlled. Seizing the opportunity, Erwin promises that he will station Eren under Levi if he is allowed to join the Survey Corps, ensuring that he will be kept under control. Additionally, to keep Walls' civilians calm, he agrees to hand Eren over to the Military Police if the boy proves to be a failure on his first expedition. Satisfied with Erwin's proposal, Zackly hands Eren over to the corps.[24] After the trial Erwin and some of his officers meet with Eren privately. Erwin apologizes to Eren for Levi's treatment of him before commending him for unwittingly giving them the perfect argument to convince the military to turn him over to the corps, formally welcoming him to the Survey Corps.[25] Erwin asks Eren who the real enemy is in order to gauge his reaction After the death of the Titan research subjects,BeanandSonny, he tests everyone in the Survey Corps by asking them a direct, but confusing question to gauge their reactions. When this turns everyone innocent, he begins planning the next expedition to capture the spy, guessing they have abilities similar to Eren and are intent on sabotaging the expedition.[26] Erwin later appears at the recruitment drive where the104th Training Corpschoose their path. He makes an impassioned plea that the Survey Corps and Eren represent the hope of humanity, although he is very realistic in telling them that a sizable number of them will die. During his speech, Erwin makes public that they will get to the basement and maybe will find clues that may free them of domination by Titans, which makes Armin think that he must have an agenda. His speech and other factors succeed in recruiting every remaining member of the top 10 graduates exceptAnnie, who joins theMilitary Police Brigade.[27] Erwin leads the Survey Corps out of Karanes District Erwin leads the57th expeditionout ofKaranes Districton a mission to reach Shiganshina District and potentially uncover the secret of Eren's basement. Shortly after the Survey Corps reaches open territory outside Wall Rose, he orders them into aLong-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation.[28] Despite the decimation of the formation's right flank by anabnormal Titan, Erwin continues the operation to the surprise of his soldiers. He directs them to aTitan Forestwhere the central column containing the carts and theSpecial Operations Squadare to follow him inside, while the rest of the formation surrounds the forest perimeter to prevent the entry of any additional Titans. Understanding that the abnormal Titan destroying his ranks is intelligent, Erwin plans to deal with it inside.[29] The Special Operations Squad leads the Female Titan into Erwin's trap, where he orders the firing of theSpecial target restraining weapon. This allows the Survey Corps to successfully capture it.[30]When Levi andMiketry to cut through the Female Titan's hands to the nape, Erwin notes that it can selectively harden its body, similar to what he has heard about theArmored Titan. He decides the corps does not have enough time to see if the Titan will weaken under repeated assaults and callsKeijiover to prepare explosives to blow off the Female Titan's hands at the wrists to avoid killing the person inside.[31] Erwin orders his soldiers to defend the Female Titan Before that can happen, the Female Titan screams and Mike alerts Erwin to multiple Titans approaching from all directions. Erwin sends the cart team to intercept the first wave of Titans, but they ignore the soldiers and break through.[32]He realizes that they are after the Female Titan and orders the Corps to defend it. However, they are overwhelmed and unable to keep up. The Female Titan is torn to pieces and Erwin calls his soldiers to retreat and return to Karanes.[33] As Erwin watches the Titans devour what remains of the Female Titan, he admits to Levi that he did not expect their enemy would be willing to sacrifice themselves. The steam emitting from the remains of the Female Titan causes him to think of theColossus Titan, which had also vanished in a cloud of steam. Before Levi can call back his team, Erwin tells him to refill his gas and blades.[34] Erwin and the Survey Corps are heckled after their defeat Hange questions the order while they ride out of the forest, because they cannot spare the time, and Erwin explains that though the Female Titan has been eaten, he can not say the same for thepersoninside. He expects that their enemy has regained human form and is now able to move around. If they also equippedvertical maneuvering equipmentthen they are likely wearing the Survey Corps uniform and are camouflaged as a fellow soldier. Erwin thinks it was a mistake to have based their assumption of the Female Titan's abilities on Eren, who is a complete novice when it comes to his power. He leads the corps back into Karanes where they are greeted by grumbles of wasted taxes and demands for justification for the number of dead. Because of the expedition's failure, Erwin is summoned to the capital to hand over Eren. Before they depart for the capital, Armin shares his suspicion with Erwin that Annie Leonhart is the Female Titan. Erwin orders her covert capture en route to the meeting.[35]After arriving inStohess Districtand fighting breaks out against the Female Titan, he is questioned by Nile Dok who orders his troops to support the operation.[36] Erwin is questioned She is eventually apprehended, and Erwin goes into an emergency meeting held to sort out the day's events. Admitting that the corps was unable to get any information out of Annie before she sealed herself away inside of a hardened crystal, Erwin requests that he be allowed to track down any allies Annie might have hidden in the military. The meeting is interrupted when a corps soldier,Thomas, bursts in to inform them that Titans have been spotted inside Wall Rose.[37]"
Who leads the expedition towards Shiganshina? (A) Erwin and other high-ranking soldiers. (B) Erwin and other high-ranking soldiers. (C) Erwin and other high-ranking soldiers.,(C) Erwin and other high-ranking soldiers.,Return to shiganshina arc,"In theTrost District, theSurvey Corps' head members are having a meeting aboutKeith Shadis' revelation. Erwin listens asHangeexplains thatGrisha Yeagerhad thepower of the Titansfrom outside theWalls. They then discuss why Grisha did not speak of the information he had to the Survey Corps but also committed the killing of theReiss familythe dayWall Mariafell.[73]They theorize about what may be hidden in the basement of Grisha's house as Erwin suggests that it may be the memories of the world that theReiss familytried to erase.[74] Erwin then announces that the operation to retake Wall Maria is ready and will commence in two days, promising to see the basement.[75]When the meeting ends,Levicloses the door behind the other members and begins to warn Erwin. He tries to convince him, with the threat of breaking his legs, to stay behind in the Trost District due to the fact that his missing arm would make him ""Titan food,"" especially on the front lines. However, Erwin confesses that seeing what is in the basement is more important to him than living and that he must be there to see this moment for humanity. After hearing this, Levi gives up and realizes that he will unfortunately not be able to change the Commander's mind.[76]Later, Erwin briefly stopped by at night of the special 'red meat' dinner accompanied by Levi and Hange.[77] Erwin leads the expedition towards Shiganshina The day of the operation, all soldiers are ready at dawn.[78]Erwin and other high-ranking soldiers salute to members of the other branches and head to the Wall. However, the soldiers are surprised after seeing that the civilians know about the operation's goals and start to cheer for them.[79]Erwin, seeing the best sends off the Survey Corps has ever received, cheers a loud scream back at them as he raises his one arm into the air, leaving his subordinates surprised for this unusual reaction. He then orders the start of the operation, and the members of the Survey Corps start their path towardsShiganshina Districtas Erwin leads them, yelling for them to once again, advance.[80] Upon arriving in Shiganshina, Erwin commands the soldiers to switch tovertical maneuvering equipmentand rush the gate, as he himself also switches to vertical equipment.[81]Erwin is aware that their enemies know about the operation to seal the Wall and investigate the basement, so he has 100 soldiers covered by their hoods rush the gate so that the enemy will be unable to know which soldier is Eren until he has sealed the gate.[82]The Corps' becomes wary of the complete lack ofTitansin the area, but they choose to continue with the mission anyway, aware they are playing into the enemies' hands. The corps' stand by and prepare for the closing of the Wall as Eren flies up above the gate and prepares to transform.[83] The Survey Corps prepare to face battle After Eren seals the breach in the southern gate of Wall Maria, Armin informs the Commander of the remains of a campsite atop the Wall as well as cold cups lying on the ground. Erwin rightly speculates that the enemy had foreseen their arrival, and he gives Armin authority over an investigation of the Wall.[84]Just after Reiner is found within the Wall and unsuccessfully attacked by Captain Levi, Erwin spots theBeast Titanand a horde of other Titans from beyond the northern gate. The Beast Titan launches a rock at Shiganshina's inner gate and traps the Survey Corps'horsesoutside, making escape into the district impossible. This begins a war and Erwin states that only one of them, the humans or the Titans, will leave alive.[85]As Reiner begins climbing the wall, Erwin orders the soldiers to avoid engaging with him. As he surveys the Beast Titan's forces, Erwin notices a quadrupedal Titan carrying luggage on its back and theorizes that it was the scout that warned the other Warriors of the Corps' arrival. As the Beast Titan's forces begin attacking, Erwin predicts that they will attack the Corps' horses next in order to completely remove any option of retreat. Erwin orders Dirk, Marlene, and their squads to join with Klaus Squad in protecting the horses north of the district, Hange and Levi's squads to engage the Armored Titan, and orders Levi to attack the Beast Titan directly and kill it. Erwin also has the idea to use Eren as bait to lure Reiner away from the Corps' horses, and orders Armin to relay the plan to Hange.[86] Erwin atop a mountain of corpses As he observes the battle from atop Wall Maria, Erwin notes the Corps' lack of manpower, prompting him to reflect on the lives lost under his command, being sent to their deaths for his own ambitions of proving his father's theories of the outside world right. Although he feels some guilt, Erwin quickly turns his attention towards Eren's basement and beings trying to work out a way to reach it even if the Corps' are defeated in battle.[87]From atop the Wall, he witnesses Bertolt being thrown into the district by Zeke[88]as well as his subsequent transformation into the Colossus Titan.[89]Seeing the Colossus Titan, Erwin questions if everything is going according to the Beast Titan's plan.[90] When Zeke begins assaulting the Survey Corps to the north with a barrage of stones and boulders, Erwin orders their retreat and joins with them at the base of the Wall. Erwin informs Captain Levi of their desperate situation, having lost many of their soldiers as well as their advantage in the battle. As the new recruits descend into a panic, Levi asks the Commander if he has any more ideas.[91]Seeing the inevitable defeat of the Survey Corps, Erwin begins to grieve over the failure of his attempts to learn the truth of the world. He thinks back on the many soldiers that died for the sake of humanity. Levi decides to make the choice of action on Erwin's behalf: Erwin must give up on his dreams and die with the recruits while Levi battles the Beast Titan. Despite his dreams coming to a bitter end, Erwin is relieved.[92] Erwin leads the charge against the Beast Titan Standing before the panicked recruits, Erwin announces their plan to charge head-on against the Beast Titan using smoke signals as cover while Levi moves in from the side to confront him, using the line of Titans as a means of clearing the distance. The recruits are distraught at the plan, asking if it is even worth the effort if they will die anyway. Erwin admits that the decisions of the recruits to fight or abandon their duties are meaningless, but the lives of the soldiers who will die are not without meaning. He declares that it is the duty of the living to give meaning to the dead, and that they must carry out their duty in a way that the living will give their own deaths meaning. The recruits agree to ride forth to their deaths. Using smoke signals as cover, they charge the Beast Titan head-on with battle cries. Charging into the fray, Erwin urges the soldiers to let their blood boil, to let their voices be heard, and fight. Erwin is struck in the hip by a flying stone at the front of the charge.[93] After the first barrage of rocks is thrown, Erwin is struck and a rock flies through the left side of his waist and through his horse's head and neck. In pain and near death, Erwin throws his head forward and smiles in determination shortly before his now dead horse collapses.[94]Erwin manages to survive the hit, but is left unconscious and mortally wounded. He is found by Floch, who carries him back to Shiganshina District. Hange and Levi sit with their fallen Commander and friend Upon arriving, the realization that Erwin is still alive causes a conflict between the remaining soldiers, who are divided on whether to save him or Armin with the only Titan injection that they have.[95]After a scuffle with Eren and Mikasa, Levi is about to give Erwin the serum when he remembers Erwin's desire to give up his dreams and die with the recruits killed earlier. Levi gives Armin the serum instead, allows him to eat Bertolt, and tells Erwin that there will be a delay in his promise to kill the Beast Titan, as Erwin dies peacefully.[96] After he wakes up fully healed, Armin learns that Erwin died so that he could live. Levi explains that it was ultimately him that chose to save Armin. When all is said and done, Erwin's body is laid to rest in an abandoned house with his cloak draped over his body and flowers set next to the bed where he lays.[97]"

How many eyes did Yuji gain during the Shibuya Incident?,two,Appearance,"Yuji is a young man of average height and appears to have a slender build when wearing baggy clothing, but actually has a lean and muscular physique. He also has relatively large light brown eyes and spiky pink hair that's styled in an undercut fashion. When becoming the vessel forSukunaafter eating his finger, he gains a second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his body along with his many markings. At the start of the series, Yuji wore a light-colored hooded jacket, high-cuffed black pants, and white shoes. However, in the anime, his pants were denim, and his shoes were bright red. When Yuji enrolled into Tokyo Jujutsu High, he began wearing his version of the uniform; a black long sleeve shirt resembling a gakuran over a red hoodie, black pants, and red shoes. He gains a noticeable scar between his two eyes and a smaller scar on his left labial commissure of the mouth during theShibuya Incident. Both scars were caused byMahito; the first one was inflicted when thecursed spiritsurprise-attacked him with a blade on his fist,[3]and the second one was inflicted when Yuji battled him after histransformation.[4] He lost the second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his body along with his many markings after the latter transferred to Megumi as his new vessel.[5]Yuji also lost his left pinky finger when Sukuna ripped off and fed it to Megumi.[6]Yuji later lost his left ring finger soYuta OkkotsucouldcopySukuna's technique.[7]"
What does Yuji believe is morally unethical for him to take another human life?,"""the value of life""",Personality,"Yuji is a fair person who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he views as people with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends ""the value of life,"" and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a ""proper death"". Because of this, he believes that it is morally unethical for him to take another human life, and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort. He is also not without his more energetic and outgoing traits. Such as his frequent comedic moments where he was seen alongside Nobara gushing about Tokyo and his eagerness to train withSatoru Gojoor even when entertaining bothJunpei Yoshinoand hismother. Yuji is also highly passionate whenever he's focused on achieving certain goals and being quite stubborn when confronted about them, such as whenMasamichi Yagaquestioned why Yuji wanted to become a sorcerer. He is also quite naïve due to his inexperience in the world of cursed spirits and jujutsu sorcerers, but is shown to be a quick learner, capable of adapting to his surroundings and picking up how to use cursed energy quickly. Although usually composed, good-natured and friendly, Yuji can be angered quickly in the face of pure malice after witnessing firsthand the cruelty that curses were capable of, particularlyMahito's inhuman exploitation of Junpei. Yuji felt so profoundly disgusted that he felt a genuine desire to kill for the first time in his life and has a very intense yet focused hatred towards the cursed spirit. One of Yuji's defining traits is his willingness to sacrifice himself for others, triggered by his grandfather's last words to him to die surrounded by others. When he and Megumi were under the threat of being killed by a curse, Yuji impulsively swallowed Sukuna's finger to exorcise the curse and save them despite having met Megumi for the first time on that day. However, Yuji's initial belief's on the value of a life as well as ""proper deaths"" have been greatly challenged overtime, primarily during theShibuya Incident. When Sukuna took possession of Yuji's body after forced consumption of his fingers, he proceeded to massacre countless innocents within the city save for Megumi, leaving Yuji traumatized from the event, wishing he was dead and blaming himself for all the deaths. This would only worsen as Yuji later witnessed Mahito killKento Nanamiand mortally wound Nobara, making Yuji lose hope in being able to save anyone, beforeAoi Todo's intervention. Eventually after a grueling battle between Mahito, Yuji spoke to the curse spirit admitting that they were alike in a way while also declaring pure and utter hatred for the latter, promising to kill Mahito: no matter how much time passed or how many times he is reborn, again and again with no need to justify his actions as anything but his nature, believing that some reasoning for his actions would eventually be found centuries after his own death. Following the incident in Shibuya, Yuji's disposition grew more solemn than before, as well as developing a changed ideology; that his purpose was to be a ""cog"" in the machine that functions to exorcise curses.[8]While still wanting to save and help people, Yuji was racked with unshakable guilt and felt that he deserved death, to the point he would even willingly take blame for the crimes committed by Sukuna when prompted by an enemy, only slightly relenting when speaking withHiromi Higuruma. While Yuji still retained most of his traits of being good-natured and friendly, he would act closed off and abrasive towards someone unfamiliar as seen withHana Kurusu, admitting that this behavior stemmed from fear of the latter replacing Nobara before apologizing later. Yuji's deep seated and focused hatred returned when Sukuna enacted on a plan to transfer his soul into Megumi, taking full possession of his friend's body. Yuji fought furiously against the King of Curses but to avail as he escaped off, with Yuji vowing that he'd ""eat anything in order to kill Sukuna"" as well as freeing Megumi. This would span into amonth long preparationwhere Yuji trained himself to get strong enough to face him, culminating in theraidon the King of Curses. Despite everything, Yuji felt a sense of pity for Sukuna, to a point where he locked the sorcerer in his domain to wander through his childhood memories. During their conversation, Yuji's ideology changed once more, explaining that he initially believed life was about fulfilling a set role and that dying fulfilling that role would be a proper death. But this was no longer the case to Yuji, who now believed that simply living a mundane life would still produce value in the fragments of memories continuing to exist after death. Yuji further stated that the way someone died did not matter, but rather it was the idea of someone treating those lives as worthless that he could not forgive and that human beings are not tools born with a predetermined role, be it good or bad, and that there is no fundamental answer as to what makes one human, while also reaffirming that if Sukuna will not release Megumi's soul, then he will kill him.[9]"
What is Yuji's ability to contain Sukuna?,with no ill effects,Overview,"Yuji contending with a special grade incarnated cursed object. Overall Skill Level: Yuji is one of Tokyo Jujutsu High's most powerful and talented students.Satoru Gojoplaces him on the same level of potential asYuta OkkotsuandKinji Hakari, the three students who he believes will surpass his strength.[10]Despite having no connections to the jujutsu world before a few months prior to theShibuya Incident, Yuji is able to contend with and defeatgrade 1and special grade curses. Yuji was gifted with superhuman physical abilities which he masterfully combines with hiscursed energy. Yuji is also able to contain Sukuna with no ill effects, which allows him to perceive the shape of souls. This enables him to harmMahito, whosecontrol over the shape of his soulotherwise renders him immune to injury.[11] Poison Resistance: Since Yuji is the host to Sukuna, he has a resistance to all kinds of poison. Yuji will feel the pain from the poison, but he is mostly unaffected. This ability was first demonstrated during his fight withJunpei Yoshinowhen he could resistMoon Dregs' poison. It was demonstrated again when Yuji resisted the effects ofEsoandKechizu'sDecay. Weapon Mastery: Yuji was not trained in the use of weapons; however, due to his physical power and talent, he can still become proficient with one quickly."
What is the name of Yuji's martial arts style?,Taido Martial Arts,Physical prowess,"Yuji's martial arts skills. Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Yuji is one of the greatest, if not the greatest practitioner of martial arts in the series. His fighting prowess goes toe to toe withAoi Todo, another extremely proficient martial artist.

Yuji's fighting style is usually depicted as being very acrobatic with his movements, allowing him to strike his opponent in several different angles which also allow him to evade several oncoming attacks, essentially giving him great offensive and defensive capabilities. If the initial strike he is going for has been blocked, he is able to use high flying kicks, unorthodox punches, and even a knee strike to retaliate. He is also skilled in a martial arts style known asTaido Martial Arts, which grants him the ability to performKnee Release, an ancient martial arts technique that eliminates starting movements and allows Yuji to release his knees, hips, and shoulders to guide him to his opponent's feet instead of falling down. By combining the technique mentioned above with Taido Martial Arts, Yuji can performManji Kick, where he uses the momentum to throw his right leg upwards and land a kick to his opponent's head. By adding cursed energy to this attack, it can harm cursed spirits. Yuji using his superhuman strength. Immense Strength: Yuji is quite powerful even without the usage ofcursed energy, as he can destroy walls with ease,[12]throw a lead ball with enough force to bend a soccer goalpost,[13]and even throw a car.[14]As powerful as he is without cursed energy, especially when it comes to fighting, his exceptional strength can often be augmented to further levels with the usage of cursed energy, theDivergent Fisttechnique, andBlack Flash, allowing him to exorcise cursed spirits. His unique strength has also been compared toKento Nanami, a grade 1 sorcerer. He can even harmHanamiandChoso, two curses who have remarkable durability and toughness with the former being near-impossible to damage. During hisfightwith Sukuna, Yuji jumped twenty stories from two buildings to reach Sukuna after the latter took control over Megumi's body. Also in his fight with Sukuna, Yuji was able to kick a massive chunk of rubble towards Sukuna, momentarily stopping him. Immense Speed and Reflexes: Yuji is shown to have great speed and can finish a 50-meter track within 3 seconds, implying he can run at speeds of 60.02 km/h .[15]He's also been shown to dodge the attacks of all five opposing sorcerers from the students fromKyoto Jujutsu Highwho tried to murder him. He is fast enough to evadeChoso'sPiercing Blood, which travels at the speed of sound, proving he has superb reflexes. During Yuji andMaki's fight against Sukuna while possessing Megumi, Yuji was able to keep up with their magnificent speed and reflexes despite being grievously wounded from his previous battle. Yuji remaining conscious despite his severe injuries. Immense Durability: Yuji's durability surpasses the average sorcerer. He was able to continuously take hits from Choso during their fight and even Piercing Blood, an attack moving at the speed of sound didn't pierce Yuji immediately. He was also able to withstand numerous attacks fromMahitoin hisInstant Spirit Body of Distorted Killingform and continue fighting. AfterSukunatook control overMegumi's body, he punched Yuji through multiple buildings and Yuji survived that, and afterwards was able to fight him and even survive Sukuna relentlessly attacking him withDismantleand keep fighting him with Maki's help. Immense Stamina: Fitting his other superhuman capabilities, Yuji possesses a large amount of stamina and has often been shown continuing to fight despite grievous injuries for longer periods of time without rest, such as having his hand severed and his fingers disintegrated when battling theFinger Bearer, allowing for Megumi to escape with Nobara. He was also able to resist several poisonous stab wounds from when he tried to stop Junpei from hurting anyone at his school. His incredible stamina is especially shown afterwards when he sustained grievous injuries from Mahito but was able to continue attacking."
How long did Yuji training with Atsuya Kusakabe and Yuta Okkotsu?,two sessions,Intelligence,"Proficient Learner: Yuji is a curious person and an earnest student. He is also good at progressing - being quick atGojo'sWatching MoviesTraining, and realizing Todo's advice quickly. According toAkutami, he is the best at cooking among the first years trio. He was able to master using martial arts alongside cursed energy and honed it to a level with which he can take on Special Grade curses. He was even able to useBlack Flashfour times in a row a short time after he had even learnt of its existence. Another testament to his development was his growing understanding of cursed energy within just a month prior to his battle against Sukuna. Through two sessions of replacement training withAtsuya KusakabeandYuta Okkotsu, aside from drastically improving his cursed energy reinforcement techniques, Yuji managed to grasp the complex nature of reverse cursed technique and learned how to use and perform it efficiently to heal himself."
How did Yuji gain a better understanding of flowing cursed energy?,training regimens,Cursed energy,"Yuji overflowing with cursed energy. Cursed Energy Capacity: Yuji's cursed energy originates from the parts of the special grade cursed object,Ryomen Sukuna. He doesn't have an innate technique, but he has shown great proficiency with learning how to control cursed energy. Yuji failing to control his cursed energy. Cursed Energy Manipulation: Having been thrust into the jujutsu world without any prior knowledge about jujutsu, Yuji initially struggled to draw out or manipulate his cursed energy, being unable to attack curses without acursed tool. Thanks to the various training regimens he underwent and having experienced Black Flash, Yuji better grasped the nature of cursed energy. By the time he had his rematch with Mahito during the Shibuya Incident, Yuji managed to land a Black Flash with maximum cursed energy, displaying the ability to use it practically at will, a feat said to be impossible for evenSatoru Gojo. Yuji gains a better understanding of flowing cursed energy. After theShibuya Incident, Yuji has added much greater finesse onto his cursed energy manipulation, combining cursed energy and superhuman physical abilities, with Choso describing him as a ""demon god"". In the month before fighting Sukuna, aside from improving his cursed energy reinforcement, Yuji managed to grasp the complex nature ofreverse cursed techniqueand learned to perform it. Cursed Energy Reinforcement: Yuji primarily uses cursed energy combined with his martial arts skills and superhuman strength to reinforce his strikes, increasing their impact and allowing him to hurt curses. Yuji uses Divergent Fist against a transfigured human. Divergent Fist: After Yuji lands a punch on a target, his cursed energy flows after the strike and makes a stronger second impact. Divergent Fist was initially used when Yuji didn't have good control over his cursed energy, causing it to lag behind his attacks due to his superhuman speed.[16]During Yuji's fight withAoi Todoin theGoodwill Event, the Kyoto third-year critiqued this attack and taught the first-year how to apply cursed energy at the exact moment his strikes hit by improving his understanding of how to flow cursed energy.[17]Since hisfightwithChoso, Yuji learned to use Divergent Fist at will, exploiting the delayed second impact's effect to confuse his opponents, leaving them open for his next attack.[18] Yuji hits Hanami with Black Flash. Black Flash: A phenomenon that occurs when the user applies cursed energy within 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit, creating a spatial distortion that causes their cursed energy to flash black and amplifies the destructive power of the strike to the power of 2.5.[19]Yuji is capable of performing Black Flash seven times in a row and has used it a total of eighteen times."

D: Yuji.,Shrine,Cursed techniques,"Shrine: After landing a Black Flash against Sukuna, the awakened state brought forth by the phenomenon drew out Sukuna's own cursed technique that was engraved in Yuji, albeit with some differences. Unlike Sukuna, Yuji creates dashed lines with scissors on anything he touches that are subsequently cut along those lines.[24]Due to only recently awakening the technique, Yuji's output for the technique is low.[25]"

Where does Megumi wear the Saitama Urami East Junior High uniform?,middle school,Appearance,"Megumi is a relatively tall and slim young man with fair skin and green eyes that slant upwards to denote his harsher and colder personality. He has uniquely styled black hair with long spikes that jut out in every direction around his head, resembling a sea-urchin . When first meeting Megumi, Gojo noted the resemblance to his fatherToji Fushiguroand Megumi himself has similar facial features and the same green eyes as his late father. Following theShinjuku Showdown Arcand his separation fromSukuna, Megumi acquires three facial scars corresponding with the eyes of Sukuna's incarnated form: one scar below Megumi's left eye, and two scars where the eyes of Sukuna's ""second face"" were.[5] Megumi typically wears a standard Jujutsu High uniform with a dark blue jacket over a long-sleeved white dress shirt. His uniform pants match his jacket and only reach to just above his shins. He wears long black socks that cover his exposed ankles and finishes his outfit with low-top brown shoes. He also has a blue tracksuit for training.

While sneaking inside theGachinko Fight Club, Megumi wore a black hoodie and matching pants with his normal shoes as a disguise."
How old is Megumi? Available choices: [A]. Grade 2; [B]. Grade 2; [C]. Grade 3; [D]. Grade 4;,[B].,Overview,"Overall Skill Level: Megumi is a grade 2 sorcerer who possesses one of the highest potentials of any student at Jujutsu High regardless of age. He inherited the prizedTen Shadows Techniqueof the Zenin clan and is favored by the strongest sorcerer himself. Satoru believes that Megumi could become as strong as he is and has stated he likely possesses even more skill and potential than Yuji.Mai Zenincommended him as a genius who started school ranked grade 2.[32]Noritoshi Kamo mirrored the same sentiment, claiming Megumi's age is irrelevant because of his inherited technique, and that he was even more reliable than the drunk Head of the Zenin clan.[33]Even Sukuna took a special interest in Megumi due to his unique talents.[34][35] Megumi exorcising curses and navigating a mission early into his career. Megumi is an exceptionally focused person and a highly disciplined combatant. He excels at keeping his cool in even the direst situations. Of all Satoru's students, Megumi is the most level-headed and clever in his approach to every fight. This has translated into an expert degree of understanding when it comes to jujutsu and how to practically apply his own skills. By the time he met Yuji, Megumi was already capable of summoning several differentshikigamiand he had a solid grasp on the Ten Shadows Technique. When Satoru left Megumi without much direction in his assignment to track downSukuna's fingerat Yuji's school, he was still able to navigate the mission on his own. Megumi was able to nearly secure Sukuna's finger without issue, but Yuji and his friends accidentally complicated the mission and led to Megumi getting caught off guard by a giant cursed spirit that nearly incapacitated him.[36] Megumi fulfilling his assignment by rescuing Nobara while also giving Yuji a crucial signal. During the evacuation of the Eishu Detention Center, Megumi quickly recognized they had been caught in an unfavorable situation when they stepped into an incomplete domain. Even so, his rational line of thinking led him to use his shikigami to navigate the facility while leading his allies through it.[37]Megumi's composure was shaken upon being faced with a special grade curse, but he was able to regain focus and switch his priority to rescuing Nobara. Using his arsenal of shikigami, Megumi was able to track Nobara down and save her. He proved to be the connective crux of this mission, also able to give Yuji the signal to let out Sukuna in order to exorcise the special grade.[38] Megumi relying on his shikigami to contend with Sukuna. Megumi and Yuji's plan, however, did backfire and Sukuna was given temporary free rein over Yuji's body, leading to a fight between him and Megumi. While clearly outclassed, Megumi figured he could force Sukuna to repair Yuji's heart if he dragged out the fight long enough. Megumi and his shikigami were not powerful enough at this point to accomplish his goal, and Megumi'sGreat Serpentwas destroyed as a result. While not fully successful, Sukuna was impressed by Megumi's power and even implied that he could've defeated the other special grade instead of fleeing.[39] This incident made Megumi realize what areas of his skill set he needed to improve on in order to become a stronger fighter. He and Nobara trained with Maki to increase their capabilities in armed and unarmed close combat.[40]It was at this time Megumi realized he could use his cursed technique in more inventive ways, such as storing weapons inside it so he can keep his hands free for summoning shikigami.[41]Megumi couldn't hope to stand up to Aoi Todo in their scuffle, but he undoubtedly increased his combat skills prior to the Goodwill Event.[42] Megumi fighting on even terms with the heir to the Kamo Family. Megumi fought on equal ground with Noritoshi Kamo during the Goodwill Event. Kamo is also someone who inherited acursed techniquepassed down in the Big Three Sorcerer Families and is two years Megumi's senior.[43]Motivated to protect Yuji from Kamo's traditionalist ideals, Megumi pushed his opponent to the limit and could've come out victorious if not forHanami's sudden invasion of the event.[44]In their joint struggle against Hanami, Megumi was able to deduce Hanami's weakness while fighting alongside Kamo andInumaki.[45]He did his best to exploit Hanami's weaknesses and hold off the special grade while teaming up with Maki. They were unable to defeat Hanami but the duo did hold the special grade off long enough for reinforcements to arrive.[46]In addition, Megumi's deductions proved invaluable for his allies in their fights against Hanami.[47] Megumi contending with a special grade curse all on his own. As Megumi's physical skills continued to grow, the only thing holding him back from his true potential was his own mental restraints, as noted by his sensei. Once Megumi stopped relying on his last resort and let his imagination flow freely, he achieved greater growth in his abilities than ever before. Megumi unleashed Domain Expansion and like Sukuna believed he could, he defeated a special gradeFinger Bearerwith nothing but his own strength.[48][49] Megumi works well in a group and has always proven to be a valuable asset. His technique allows him to summon a variety of different aids to not only him, but his entire squad. For example, hisDivine Dogsallows for easier tracking andNueprovides an option for attacking targets in the air. His value as a squad member was showcased a great deal in not only the Goodwill Event but the direShibuya Incidentas well. Megumi had to work together with other sorcerers to survive the perilous battles in Shibuya. He was originally assigned to the Nanami Team where he had just as much of an understanding of the situation asTakuma Ino, who is significantly more experienced.[50] Megumi working together with Yuji to defeat an enemy curse user. As the operation to rescue Satoru began, Megumi teamed up with Yuji and Ino to take down barriers preventing sorcerers from reaching Shibuya Station. Megumi's Nue allowed Yuji and Ino to mount an assault on Shibuya C Tower where the barrier originated and they drew the curse user's guarding the curtain into a battle.[51]While Megumi initially struggled to find a rhythm fighting in tandem with Yuji,[52]they were able to work it out and defeatJiro Awasaka, a heavily experienced curse user. Megumi deduced exactly how Awasaka'sinnate techniqueworked and created an effective plan that completely defeated the curse user.[53]Ino was heavily injured in his fight, but Megumi was able to rescue him from falling from the tower using Nue and then took him toShokoto be healed. It was thanks to Megumi's efforts and the versatility of his shikigami that the curtain was taken down and Ino was rescued.[54][55] Megumi rescuing his allies from the sure-hit function of Dagon's domain. Megumi re-entered the incident and immediately saved the life of Maki, Naobito, and Nanami from the sure-hit ofDagon'sdomain expansion. He entered Dagon's domain willingly and created a physical hole inside the barrier so his allies could escape. His interference halted Dagon's relentless assault withDeath Swarm, which would have surely killed all the sorcerers.[56]While everything didn't go quite as planned, Megumi's intervention saved the lives of his comrades.[57]He accidentally let in a reanimatedToji Zenin,[58]who easily defeated Dagon for them. Then Toji isolated Megumi from the rest of the team and the latter immediately realized the amount of danger he was in.[59]However, he was able to survive against the same monstrous physical prowess that overpowered Ino and Dagon. Megumi remained calm and focused, allowing him to stall for time with every move he made. He rationally accepted that he couldn't escape the fight without an injury, so he accounted for Shoko's presence and decided to try and only suffer an injury he could manage.[60] Megumi attempting to take his enemy with him instead of simply succumbing to injury. Without anyone else to watch his back, Megumi was exhausted and susceptible to a surprise attack after consecutive fights.Haruta Shigemoslashed him across the back and heavily injured Megumi.[61]Even on his last legs, Megumi was able to keep his opponent at bay and come up with a plan, something Shigemo commended him for.[62]Rather than allow himself to bleed out or get killed, Megumi decided to summon the unstoppableMahoragato attack both of them.[63]Interested in the young sorcerer, Sukuna rescued Megumi from Mahoraga, proving that his decision not to give up was the correct one.[64][65]His injuries left Megumi inactive for the rest of the Shibuya Incident, but his value was heavily showcased. Megumi was able to save his allies on numerous occasions and he helped defeat several key adversaries before he was incapacitated. Megumi outsmarts Kirara by using their own technique against them. Motivated by the goal of rescuing Tsumiki from the Culling Game, Megumi continued to advance the applications of his cursed technique, which he displayed while skillfully infiltrating theGachinko Fight Club. He gathered information on Hakari's hideout and put himself and Yuji in positions to complete their task of recruiting him without drawing too much suspicion. When he and Panda were compromised byKirara Hoshi, a third-year Jujutsu High student, Megumi acted quickly so that they didn't derail the mission.[66]Kirara's technique is particularly complex and most people can't even begin to understand how it functions, but Megumi was able to completely deduce the workings ofLove Rendezvous.[67]Not only that, but he was able to outsmart Kirara using their own technique and restrained them so he could appeal to them as an ally rather than an enemy.[68] Megumi eliminating an enemy Culling Game player. The culmination of Megumi's developments as a combatant was heavily showcased in the Culling Game, a deadly battle royale between sorcerers. He contended with enemy sorcerers in the Tokyo No. 1 Colony after it had already reached a deadlocked point where only some of the strongest players remained. OverpoweringRemiwas easy for Megumi[69]and he was even able to survive the four-on-one ambush she led him into.[70]Not only did Megumi survive an onslaught of explosions from Reggie Star and Iori Hazenoki, but he eliminatedChizuru Hari, a player with twenty-eight points in the process. Megumi easily overpowered Hari on two separate occasions using a combination of jujutsu and taijutsu. In the second confrontation, Megumi took Hari's life before the latter could even use his cursed technique.[71] Megumi using all his collective abilities to overcome Reggie. By cooperating with Fumihiko Takaba, Megumi was able to execute a plan to separate Reggie from Hazenoki. Megumi was severely worn down from the ambush but he was eventually able to get Reggie one-on-one and fight on even terms with the incarnated sorcerer.[72]Reggie was a very tough opponent for Megumi, he had more experience as a sorcerer from the past and he possessed an analytical mind that could match Megumi's. Not only that, but Reggie was in peak physical condition compared to his tattered opponent. Despite all Reggie's advantages, Megumi used everything in his arsenal to match him every step of the way, forcing Reggie to recognize his strength.[73][74] Megumi's shikigami helped him deduce Reggie's technique[75]and he used several deceptions to outsmart Reggie, something Reggie himself specialized at.[76]Megumi proved to be more clever and was able to think several steps ahead of Reggie. He led Reggie into a mental trap where he was thoroughly convinced Megumi couldn't deal a finishing blow. Reggie was severely mistaken and Megumi used this to surprise attack Reggie with Divine Dog after using several near-fight-ending strategies as mere diversions. In spite of his depleted stamina and all the other disadvantages he was faced with, Megumi was able to use all of his accumulated experience to definitively defeat Reggie.[77][78]"
What does Megumi think of his opponent's strengths and weaknesses in the heat of battle?,"Using his advanced deducting reasoning skills, Megumi thinks of clever ways to deal with every situation as it comes. This is regularly showcased by Megumi's consistent talent for deducing his opponent's strengths and weaknesses in the heat of battle.",Intelligence,"Megumi expertly explaining jujutsu to the uninitiated. Immense Tactical Intellect: Megumi's most reliable and imposing asset as a sorcerer is his mind. He is a young genius, a cerebral fighter whose focus in a battle is to outwit his opponent rather than overpower them. Megumi assesses all threats logically and deals with them in a strategic manner. Using his advanced deducting reasoning skills, Megumi thinks of clever ways to deal with every situation as it comes. This is regularly showcased by Megumi's consistent talent for deducing his opponent's strengths and weaknesses in the heat of battle. Megumi possesses a wealth of knowledge about jujutsu and an expert-level understanding of it, equal to that of full-fledged sorcerers. As a student, Megumi lacks an excess of battle experience but he makes up for the difference with his tactical mindset. His fundamental understanding of sorcery enables him to take the lead on missions, or even go out on his own without much guidance. Megumi was able to give a solid explanation of the basics of curses to Yuji, someone totally uninitiated.[79]In the detention center, Megumi was the only one of Satoru's students who could recognize a domain and assess its threat level while also taking into account its incompletion.[80] Megumi uses a shikigami on its last legs to create an opening. Megumi's jujutsu knowledge extends to reading the behavior of fellow sorcerers. Megumi figured out the Kyoto Team's objective during the Goodwill Event by tracking their movements. Fully aware of how sorcerers tend to view Sukuna's vessel, Megumi quickly realized the Kyoto Team was trying to assassinate his ally.[81]As a former associate of one of the Big Three Families, Megumi had prior knowledge ofBlood Manipulationbefore he fought with Kamo. Quickly after witnessingFlowing Red Scalein action, Megumi noticed his opponent was essentially doping.[82]In order to deal with Kamo's boost in speed, Megumi took a tactical approach. He used aToadon its last legs to distract Kamo and then took advantage of the time gained from this to summonMax Elephant. By using Max Elephant to flood the area with water, Kamo's physical advantage was nullified and he was forced outside into an open space where Nue could capitalize.[83] Megumi passing on information he ascertained about Hanami's weakness. Megumi generally looks for an opponent's shortcomings to exploit after he's ascertained their abilities. He was able to find the weak point in Hanami's hard shell after noticing that it was invulnerable to all attacks except for Kamo'sPiercing Bloodon its eye branches. Megumi considered the possibility Kamo was holding back his strength in their own duel, but he confirmed Hanami's weakness by attacking the eye branches himself.[84]He was unable to use this information to bring down Hanami, but he knew it was important to pass it down to his allies that would encounter the special grade curse later.[47] Megumi also possesses adept analytical skills. This helped him navigate the mystery of theYasohachi Bridgerelated deaths. He collected information with his team and tried out several different hypotheses until they eventually located the curse's barrier. When faced with the curse itself, Megumi understood logically that it was pointless to think about its behavior too much. However, upon seeing a Finger Bearer emerge, Megumi pondered it just enough to figure out Sukuna's influence was the catalyst for the deaths.[85] Megumi accurately deducing the details of Awasaka's Inverse technique. Megumi's intellectual skills are what empowered him to survive Shibuya. He figured out the mechanics of Awasaka'sInversetechnique despite its precise mechanics not being apparent at first glance. It initially appeared as if Awasaka could nullify damage, but Megumi knew that technique would be too powerful and used a bluff to get a gauge for his strength. He got Awasaka to admit he couldn't defeat Satoru Gojo and this helped Megumi narrow down his theories.[86]He figured that something like Inverse would be difficult to use on complex techniques like the Limitless. Not only did Megumi eventually deduce the exact details of Inverse, but its upper and lower limits as well. Once he figured that out, Megumi utilized a simple strategy where he and Yuji combined weak and strong blows. This was an effective countermeasure that best utilized their teamwork and it brought down Awasaka quickly.[87] Megumi creating a hole in Dagon's domain rather than overtaking it. Megumi's advanced understanding of jujutsu enabled him to effectively counter Dagon's Horizon of the Captivating Skhanda to rescue his allies from sure defeat. He was aware that using a domain, even an incomplete one, inside another domain would nullify its user's sure-hit effect. He also understood that his domain would never overtake his opponent's and decided to focus on creating a hole in the barrier instead. By deluding Dagon into believing he was engaging in a domain tug-of-war, Megumi bought himself enough time to create the escape hole for his team.[88] Megumi redirects Toji's attack to a non-vital area. Faced with an opponent he couldn't physically hope to defeat, Megumi had to rely on his analytical skills. He accurately assessed Toji's monstrous threat and planned accordingly. He was aware he couldn't run from Toji forever and decided to deliberately allow himself to be hit. He focused on redirecting Toji's attack to a non-vital area on his body and achieved this by narrowing the options for his opponent's approach. Megumi gauded Toji into attacking him straight-on and then compromised his footing on the approach using his shadow. Megumi's clever thinking allowed him to contain his injury to something that could be healed later and it allowed him to get ahold of his much faster opponent.[89] One of Megumi's most reliable skills is his ability to focus on deducing opposing cursed techniques while fighting them. As he did with Inverse, Megumi was able to understand and accurately theorize about Kirara Hoshi'sLove Rendezvousas well. Kirara's technique is a very technical ability that's far more difficult to understand than Inverse. By collecting information as the fight began, Megumi noticed that Kirara could repel anything that approached them and they could make things attract to one another. He began working on his theory by testing what could and couldn't approach Kirara, summoning numerous rabbits to cover the battlefield. UsingRabbit Escapehelped Megumi physically see what areas around them could cover and he used his astute memory to take it in quickly. Working from there, Megumi discovered Kirara's technique marked him and all his shikigami. The markings led him to theorize the technique was based on a constellation. Thanks to his experience stargazing with Tsumiki, Megumi accurately guessed that Love Rendezvous was based on the Southern Cross constellation. Megumi wasn't sure, but by stating it with confidence, he tricked Kirara into confirming it with their reaction. Their surprised facial expression confirmed Megumi's theory and Kirara expected him to figure out their technique at that point. Megumi using his shikigami to help deduce the mechanics of a cursed technique. Even while under more pressure from Kirara, not only did Megumi fill the conditions to approach them, but he deluded Kirara into believing all his shikigami had been dispelled. In actuality, Megumi jammed Divine Dog against a wall so it wouldn't be attracted to him and maneuvered his body so that it would only be free once Kirara was between them. Once Megumi let Divine Dog loose, Kirara's technique attracted the shikigami right to them. Megumi not only deduced the complex technique but he even used its functions to defeat its user.[90] Megumi getting Kirara to confirm his theory using body language. The culmination of all Megumi's mental abilities was on display when he was pushed to his limit fighting Reggie Star. Compared to Love Rendezvous, Reggie'sContractual Re-Creationwas much more straightforward and easy for Megumi to figure out. Figuring water was a natural countermeasure to Reggie's receipts, Megumi's initial strategy was to distract Reggie with other shikigami to give Max Elephant an opening to douse Reggie. However, Reggie was a cerebral fighter as well and had more experience. Reggie caught Megumi in a few verbal traps with his deceptions, so Megumi decided he needed to do the same.[91] Megumi makes clever use of the shadows above Reggie to drop Max Elephant on him. The key to victory for Megumi was to deceive his far more deceitful enemy by thinking several steps ahead of him. Megumi led Reggie to underestimate him by playing into the notion that he didn't have any big moves. Then he trapped Reggie inside his domain by using a gymnasium to enclose the incomplete barrier and completely took him by surprise.[92]However, Reggie was crafty and turned the conditions of the domain against Megumi, forcing him to carry tons of weight. Megumi countered by making clever use of the shadows of the domain above Reggie to drop the heavy shikigami right on top him while dousing him in water at the same time.[93] Additionally, Megumi led Reggie to believe that Divine Dog was destroyed and couldn't be resummoned in their fight. Then Megumi usedChimera Shadow Gardenand dropped Reggie into a pool of water, two potential fight-ending moves. Reggie survived both, leading him to believe Megumi was desperate and out of trump cards. Unafraid of Megumi's other shikigami, Reggie thought Megumi's only deception was engaging in a taijutsu fight while fully intending to summon something other than Divine Dog. The true deception was that Megumi could summon Divine Dog all along, allowing it to take Reggie by surprise and deal the fight-ending blow.[94][95]"
What is Megumi's nickname?,King of Curses,Physical prowess,"""A shikigami user who isn't afraid to mix it up!"" Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Megumi is a strong fighter who has never been afraid to get in close to hit his opponents. He's always been stronger than normal people his age, able to effortlessly beat down a human pile of bullies on his own.[96]In one of his earliest missions, Megumi was already strong enough to destroy a curse with just the swipe of his bare hands.[97]Megumi has a fast and graceful style of fighting that's evidence of his comfort in close combat. However, by sorcerer standards, Megumi was still weak at close range when faced with dangerous threats, especially without the help of his shikigami.[98]Sukuna was impressed by Megumi's willingness to engage in hand-to-hand combat despite being a shikigami user but the King of Curses easily overpowered Megumi even while he was supported by shikigami.[99] Maki trained Megumi to be more reliable in close combat but he prefers to supplement himself with weaponry rather than fight unarmed. Megumi only truly excels at hand-to-hand combat while his domain boosts his cursed energy reinforcement. When his sword was broken by the Finger Bearer, Megumi rapidly summoned shikigami alongside his taijutsu to overpower the special grade.[100]The same occurred when Megumi used shadow clones in the domain to barrage Reggie with combinations of punches, flying kicks, and elbows.[101] Megumi comfortably swapping weapons with Maki mid-fight. Expert Weapons Specialist: Megumi was trained by Maki, the best cursed tool user at Jujutsu High, to use a variety of different weapons. He can keep cursed tools in his shadow, so Megumi is capable of swapping out multiple weapons for himself at any time.[102]Maki began by teaching Megumi with a polearm he quickly became comfortable with,[103]and after nearly two months of training, Megumi was able to use a pair of tonfa for the Goodwill Event.[104]In his fight with Kamo, Megumi was able to make effective use of the tonfa, especially on the defensive, using them to block Kamo's enhanced strength until they were broken.[105] Megumi utilizing his preferred choice of weaponry. In a life or death encounter, instead of using blunt weapons, Megumi will generally arm himself with one handed-swords that are lightweight and easy to store if he needs to free up his hands to summon shikigami. He wielded his signature black blade with great speed and efficiency, able to land two blows on Hanami with it.[106][107]He also hit Hanami withPlayful Cloudafter swapping weapons with Maki mid-fight, displaying Megumi's advanced weapon dexterity.[108]Using his black blade, Megumi also destroyed numerous heads of the Yasohachi Bridge curse in quick succession with great speed and skill.[109] Megumi's current weapon of choice is another one-handed blade he still incorporates while fighting at close range. He fights gracefully and in a crude manner depending on the situation, making use of both the double-edged blade and the back of the handle to injure his opponents. In combination with a barrage of Yuji's punches, Megumi pummeled Awasaka with the blunt side of his sword.[110]Megumi eliminated Chizuru Hari from the Culling Game by smashing his face with the circular-shaped hilt of the sword before killing Hari with a brutal slash to the head.[111]Up against Reggie, who was the superior taijutsu specialist, Megumi continued to use his swordplay to supplement his close combat skills throughout their entire fight.[112] Megumi withstanding a direct assault from Todo. Advanced Endurance: Megumi is especially tough for a human being, with high pain tolerance, exceptional stamina, and especially impressive durability. He's shown his toughness on numerous occasions where he was able to withstand a beating and survived the battle, sometimes even overcoming his own exhaustion to achieve victory. Megumi can survive direct attacks from even special grade cursed spirits. He suffered a beatdown at the hands of Sukuna without any major injuries.[113]Todo also overpowered Megumi in a similar fashion, but in both cases, Megumi never passed out and he continuously refused to back down.[114] Megumi undeterred by injury during a heated battle. Hanami struck Megumi with a cursed bud that drained his cursed energy and injured his gut, but Megumi remained standing and was willing to continue fighting.[115]In his fight with the Finger Bearer, Megumi suffered serious head trauma and was knocked unconscious only for a few moments. Despite the severity of his injuries and his depleted stamina, Megumi pushed himself to the limit and exorcised the curse, although he passed out right after.[116]When he allowed himself to be stabbed by Toji, Megumi barely winced from the pain despite his abdomen getting punctured.[117]When he was grievously injured by Shigemo, Megumi still managed to muster up enough strength to summon Mahoraga before he bled out.[118]In the Tokyo No. 1 Colony, Megumi was hit by several explosions and was in rough shape after getting ambushed by Reggie and Hazenoki.[119]Megumi fought through his exhaustion and was able to ignore his injuries long enough to defeat Reggie, who was entirely refreshed with full stamina at the start of their fight.[120]"
How many shikigami can Megumi summon at the same time?,three,Cursed energy,"Cursed Energy Capacity: While not on the level of a special grade, Megumi has a very high volume of cursed energy. He's constantly summoning shikigami while also reinforcing his body with cursed energy in battle. Megumi displayed immense reserves of cursed energy in numerous drawn-out battles while rarely fully exhausting himself. He can summon up to three shikigami at the same time and uses multiple summonings in every fight. Megumi's swelling cursed energy. Megumi's cursed energy was running low against Sukuna after using several shikigami in the detention center and in their fight, but he was still capable of summoning Mahoraga if need be. Like the detention center incident, Megumi used a high volume of shikigami during the Goodwill Event and still didn't fully exhaust himself by the end of his fight with Hanami. A testament to Megumi's overall cursed energy is his ability to conjure a domain, which requires a massive amount of it. In Shibuya, Megumi used shikigami before and even after casting his domain without expending himself completely. A similar feat was achieved against Reggie, where Megumi used Max Elephant alongside other shikigami. He usually uses Max Elephant alone because it consumes a lot of cursed energy, but he still had enough to cast his domain afterward. Even after dispelling his domain, Megumi could still summon Divine Dog: Totality with the last of cursed energy."

How did Nobara feel when she was forced out of the neighborhood?,disheartened,Personality,"""It's to stay true to myself."" Nobara is a confident and brash young woman with an unshakable character. More than anything, Nobara is determined to stay true to herself no matter what.[5]She takes great pride in being both a pretty girl and a strong fighter, refusing to let anyone influence her.[6] Initially, Nobara can appear to be a very obnoxious and arrogant person. She first introduced herself to Yuji and Megumi by expressing how inferior they were and argued with Yuji for the greater part of their first mission together.[7]Despite her abrasive attitude, Nobara is actually an incredibly caring and dutiful person, but would never let most people see that side of her. After fighting alongside each other on several missions, Yuji and Megumi grew to become Nobara's closest allies. Nobara leaves her village behind but promises to reunite with Fumi and Saori someday. Even from a young age, Nobara was outspoken and different from everyone else in her small town.[8]She felt everyone was crazy and was determined to trade the small countryside to the big city. Nobara was only ever drawn to outsiders who moved into the village likeFumiandSaori, especially the latter. She looked up to Saori to a great degree and was disheartened when she was forced out of the neighborhood. Saori leaving made Nobara want to escape the village more and aspired to meet Saori again one day. Before attending Jujutsu High, Nobara made a promise to Fumi that the three of them would reunite in Tokyo.[9] Staying true to who she is, Nobara carries herself confidently as a jujutsu sorcerer. Whenever Yuji and Megumi tend to be decisive, Nobara is willing to take charge even if the boys don't like it. While they're prone to panic in some situations, Nobara is able to remain relatively level-headed regardless of what's happening. Nobara loves joking around in civil situations and is a huge trash talker in combative ones, no matter who it is. Among all her peers, Nobara looks up toMaki Zeninin particular. She loves the way Maki carries herself and admires her strength as someone fighting against the oppression of their own family.[10] Nobara punishing Yuji for dying and resurrecting without being considerate of her. Nobara and Yuji are the two class clowns among the first years that typically annoy Megumi to for a laugh any chance they get. Although she likes to pretend that she doesn't like the boys, Nobara was upset after Yuji's death following the Detention Center incident.[11]She even shed a tear upon his revival and demanded an apology from him. Momo Nishimiyainsulted Yuji during theGoodwill Eventwhile trying to justifyMai Zenin's undesirable attitude, annoying Nobara. Nobara dislikes Mai, which upset Momo and caused her to monologue about the gender-based discrimination in theZenin Clan. This only served to annoy Nobara, who couldn't care less about any sentiments based in ""boys versus girls"". Like Saori, Maki is a good person despite the circumstances that surround her while Mai is not. Nobara doesn't believe people are excused just because they come from a difficult background. She openly rejected Momo and told her to consider the kind of person Yuji was before condemning him, citing that life isn't just a job.[12] ""Good. She's plenty crazy."" Upon first enrolling at Jujutsu High,Satoru Gojowas unsure how a girl from the countryside would fair against gruesome-lookingcursed spirits. Satoru believes it takes someone to be virtually insane to voluntarily be a jujutsu sorcerer or else they'll quit quickly. Despite her distaste for crazy people, Nobara has proved she is plenty crazy herself.[13]She passed Satoru's test with flying colors and didn't hesitate to inflict pain on herself during thebattlewith theDeath Paintings,EsoandKechizu.[14] In order to counter Eso'scursed technique, Nobara willingly stabbed herself with nails and smiled while doing it. She appeared to take pleasure in outwitting her opponents and didn't hesitate to injure herself further in order to ensure victory and her own survival. Together, she and Yuji were victorious and ended up killing both brothers. Although Yuji was guilt-ridden over killing the brothers, Nobara was relatively unfazed. She admitted that she expected killing came with the job of being a jujutsu sorcerer. Noticing that Yuji was acting strange, Nobara comforted him in her own way by claiming that they were both accomplices in the murder.[15] Yuji's fond memories of Nobara and their dynamic with Megumi. Nobara has a high sense of duty as a jujutsu sorcerer and is a prideful fighter. During theShibuya Incident, Nobara's pride was hurt by her near defeat at the hands ofHaruta Shigemo. After being rescued byKento Nanami, Nobara wanted to help rescue Satoru from being sealed and redeem herself. However, Nanami refused to let her and ordered her to wait to be rescued.[16]Nobara ignored Nanami's warning because she couldn't bring herself to leave the city while all her allies were still fighting.[17] Upon encountering Mahito's double soon afterward, Nobara admitted she didn't have much to show for October 31st and believed beating him would be a solid contribution.[18]Nobara remained confident in her strategy and managed to injure Mahito's soul, forcing him to retreat. Nobara chased him and attempted to exorcise the curse. This overconfidence ultimately proved to be Nobara's downfall. ""It wasn't so bad!"" Mahito switched places with his double while Nobara's guard was down against his hands, letting him score a direct hit to her face withIdle Transfiguration.[19]Realizing her time was likely at an end, Nobara took a moment to recall her past life in the village. She used to believe that crazy people like those villagers did nothing but step on other people's lives. However, after meeting all the wild and crazy sorcerers at Jujutsu High, Nobara changed her mind. During this exchange, Yuji watches Nobara with extreme worry and horror. In what could have been her last moments, Nobara smiled at Yuji and asked him to tell everyone that it wasn't so bad in the end.[20] Following her recovery on December 24, Nobara appeared to still be in high spirits after being brought up to speed about theraidagainstSukuna, happily taking the opportunity to help defeat the sorcerer withResonance. Upon seeing Yuji again, the two got up to old habits by attempting to surprise Megumi with the fact she was alive, later making up for lost time with him after.[21]"
How did Nobara fight Momo?,flying above Nobara on her broom,Abilities and powers,"Nobara exorcising a curse on her first mission. Overall Skill Level: Nobara is ranked as a grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer by Jujutsu High. This is mostly due to her status as a young first-year student and inexperience working as a sorcerer. Nobara has showcased numerous times the capability to contend with jujutsu users ranked leagues above in terms of grade. Coming into school, Nobara had a solid understanding of how to exorcise curses with her innate technique.[22]She also had the mental fortitude to handle the job but lacked physical ability. While fighting in the Eishu Detention Center, Nobara defended herself adequately until she ran out of nails to fight with.[23] Improvements in physical strength allowed Nobara to compensate for her disadvantage against Momo. Afterward, Maki took Nobara under her wing and trained her to improve her physical prowess. The training included heavy stamina conditioning and getting used to getting knocked down byPanda.[24]By the time of the Goodwill Event, Nobara showcased she was in much better shape as a close-combat fighter. In Nobara's fight with Momo, the Kyoto third year had the advantage of flying above Nobara on her broom. Nobara eventually figured out a way to outmaneuver Momo by using the environment to her advantage. Nobara was able to last long enough in that fight due to Maki and Panda's training. She was knocked down several times by gusts of cursed energy wind, but Nobara endured until she figured out a way to counterattack.[25] Nobara embracing self-inflicting pain necessary to ensure victory. Despite ultimately being eliminated from the Goodwill Event, Nobara has since demonstrated the potential to combat special grade curses. Alongside Yuji, Nobara was able to fight on even terms with Eso and Kechizu. Both the students were poisoned by the Death Painting's blood technique, but Nobara used that connection against her adversaries. Thanks to her cleverness and ability to think clearly in high-pressure situations, Nobara instantly figured out a way to counter her opponent's technique.[26] Nobara's adaptability and fearlessness lead her to use Resonance on herself to injure Eso and Kechizu at the same time. This involved stabbing herself with nails to activate Resonance, but Nobara was more than happy to do so. The poison, as well as the pain from stabbing herself, helped Nobara enter a state of extreme focus, allowing her to unleash the power of Black Flash as well. Nobara and Yuji defeated the special grade curses, prompting Mei Mei and Todo to recommend her and all her peers for grade 1.[27] Nobara confidently fighting a special grade in close quarters During the Shibuya Incident, Nobara underestimated the curse user Shigemo and was taken off guard repeatedly by his uncanny abilities. Shigemo was landing the perfect shots on Nobara, making it difficult for her to keep her balance, let alone fight back. Thinking on her feet, Nobara got Shigemo to talk in order to buy herself some time. This led to Nanami arriving in time to defeat the curse user and rescue her.[28] Nobara tapping into her potential. Having little to show for the incident, Nobara continued fighting rather than retreating as she was ordered. She encountered Mahito, an opponent she had information on unlike with Shigemo. In order to combat someone of his caliber, Nobara focused on trying to reach the core of cursed energy, the same feeling that accompanied unlockingBlack Flash. Nobara was able to plan out a strategy accordingly and executed it flawlessly. She led Mahito's double to believe that she was recklessly focusing on physical damage that couldn't hurt his soul. In reality, Nobara knew she could hurt Mahito's soul if she could use his body as an effigy for her technique. After leading him into a false sense of security, Nobara struck his soul and dealt Mahito major damage. Almost immediately, Mahito recognized Nobara as one of his natural enemies in the same way he views Yuji.[29]"

Who is the pride of the Gojo Clan?,Satoru,English voice,"Satoru Gojois one of the main protagonists of theJujutsu Kaisenseries. He is aspecial gradejujutsu sorcererand widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of theGojo Clan, the first person to inherit both theLimitlessand theSix Eyesin four hundred years. He works as a teacher at theTokyo Jujutsu Highand uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies."
How does Gojo feel towards Satoru? Select from the following. (A) Arrogant. (B) Confident. (C) Arrogant.,(A),Personality,"Satoru is a complex individual. He is usually laidback and playful with his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, as seen in his blatant disrespect towards PrincipalGakuganjiand his enemies. ""Throughout heaven and earth, I alone am the honored one."" Satoru is overconfident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only goes as far as his judgment of their strength, and he is rather apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his desire for power, Gojo is very arrogant. He believes himself to be the strongest in the world, claiming, during his fight withToji Fushiguro, that ""throughout heaven and earth, [he] alone is the honored one."" It is evident during his task of protectingRiko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for. However, his regret for her death was negated by his extensive pride and arrogance after learning reverse cursed technique in his following battle againstToji Fushiguro.[7] During intense battles, Satoru occasionally falls into a manic fighting state, urged by his determination for victory and undeniable proof that he alone is the strongest. His combative style is characterized by his aggressive and domineering attacks while flaunting his mastered techniques to his opponents. Furthermore, in a crisis, he is capable of being cold-blooded. He will prioritize his enemies' destruction over saving innocent people when he believes that the sacrifice is unavoidable. However, this only extends to the people killed by his opponent; he will not do any lasting harm to or kill anyone innocent to gain the upper hand.[8] Nevertheless, despite his arrogance and strength, Satoru is more human than he first appears. After defeating Toji, Satoru retrieved Riko's corpse with a sorrowful look, showing that although his recent conceited victory temporarily clouded his feelings, he still felt some grief over her death. He sought to kill theStar Religious Groupmembers who were clapping over Riko's death before being stopped bySuguru Geto— who he relied on as a moral compass at that time — from taking any action.[9]Furthermore, Satoru was later left visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Suguru, his ""one and only"" best friend, had become a murderouscurse user. Satoru attempted to reason with his friend but eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an equal.[10]After having to put an end to Suguru's life before more calamity arose, it was Satoru's trauma over losing his best friend that caused his ultimate downfall inShibuya. He was also distraught when Yuji seemingly died. Satoru's dream and endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom up through education. He seeks to foster a new generation of sorcerers that he hopes will one day become his equals.[11]"
Who is the King of Curses?,Sukuna,Overview,"Satoru Gojo shows off his overwhelming power. Overall Skill Level: Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru is known to be the strongest, holding both immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique. No one can seemingly match his skill level except for the King of Curses,Sukuna. As students, Satoru and Suguru were considered ""the strongest,"" capable of quickly dealing with experienced and powerful curse users. Whereas before, he and Geto were no match for the renowned Sorcerer Killer, Satoru's abilities vastly increased to where he was able to putToji Fushigurointo the defensive and ultimately kill him with his strongest technique after realizing and perfecting his capabilities. As he continued growing, he eclipsed Suguru's talents to the point Saguru admitted Satoru to be the strongest alone. Suguru also stated that Satoru had the capability of killing all of humanity by himself, which Suguru admitted was out of his ability and didn't even try to fight back when Satoru prepared to kill him, although Satoru ultimately relented as he was unable to kill his best friend. Hanami, a powerful special grade, is no match. In the present, Satoru's might was feared by the higher-ups of the jujutsu society, to where Satoru could easily force them to cancel the executions of the likes of the dangerous fellow special-grade sorcererYuta Okkotsuand the vessel ofSukuna,Yuji Itadori. He states that it would be easy for him to kill them all and overthrow the jujutsu society if he actually wanted to. Satoru even claimed that he could defeat Sukuna at full power. Kenjakuand his group of special-grade cursed spirits were also wary of Satoru's power and skill, with Kenjaku admitting he couldn't defeat Gojo in direct battle. He was capable of entirely overpowering and killingJogo, who was the strongest of the group, and simply his presence was able to forceHanamito retreat, with Gojo almost killing the special-grade cursed spirit with a single attack. When Kenjaku and his group finally developed a plan to face him in combat, despite their preparations, Satoru was still capable of easily fending off their assaults and overpowering them, leaving them astounded by how exceeding his capabilities truly were, killing Hanami and only being defeated due to Kenjaku using his past with Geto to distract him long enough for thePrison Realmto seal him."
How does Gojo use his cursed energy?,"to constantly reinforce himself and activate his cursed techniques multiple times, without ever showing signs of exhausting his reserves",Cursed energy,"Gojo's overwhelming amount of cursed energy. Cursed Energy Capacity: Satoru Gojo is known as the strongest jujutsu sorcerer within the modern jujutsu society. He earned this alias in part due to the immense amounts of cursed energy he possesses. Gojo's vast cursed energy, combined with his cursed energy efficiency, allows him to expand his domain at least five times in one day, while most sorcerers andspecial gradecursed spiritscan only use it once. Throughout his fight with Sukuna, Gojo used cursed energy to constantly reinforce himself and activate his cursed techniques multiple times, without ever showing signs of exhausting his reserves. Cursed Energy Manipulation: Gojo has excellent control over his cursed energy due to the Six Eyes. He is capable of expanding his domain for a split second, using reverse cursed technique, and simultaneously activating and controlling multipleBluesandReds. Additionally, Gojo has extraordinary cursed energy efficiency. When using cursed techniques, Gojo suffers almost zero unnecessary cursed energy loss. As a result, he spends less cursed energy compared to other sorcerers during combat, giving the impression that he never runs out of cursed energy.[26][27]This allows him to keep Limitless activated at all times while constantly using reverse cursed technique to heal his brain to prevent fatigue,[28]despite the latter's massive cursed energy consumption.[29] Cursed Energy Output: In addition to his immense cursed energy capacity, Gojo can output high amounts of cursed energy into his techniques to augment their effects. By strengthening the output into his Limitless technique, Gojo countered Jogo and Hanami's strategy to neutralize his Infinity withdomain amplification, expanding the size of Infinity to the point that he could even push back and crush Hanami against a wall with the barrier.[30] By deliberately including the incantations and hand signs of his cursed techniques, Gojo can increase their cursed energy output. While being amplified byUtahime Iori'sSolo Forbidden Area, Gojo boosted hisHollow Technique: Purple's output to 200% by chanting its cursed chant and performing its gestures. Upon unleashing Purple, the technique travelled fromShibuyatoShinjuku, covering almost four kilometers of distance and carving through all the obstacles in its path.[31][32] Gojo channeling cursed energy through his fists. Cursed Energy Reinforcement: Even when he was a second-year student, Gojo was already skilled at reinforcing his body with cursed energy. When Toji stabbed through his chest with a sword, Gojo reinforced his cursed energy so that the sword couldn't do further damage, causing the injury to hardly affect him during theirfirst battle.[33] As an adult, Gojo can strengthen himself with cursed energy to vastly increase his physical strength or fortify his body. Many of his aforementioned feats of strength and speed can be attributed to his skill in reinforcement techniques. With cursed energy reinforcement and hand-to-hand combat alone, Gojo was able to overwhelm two special grade cursed spirits. In several instances, single strikes from Gojo were strong enough to either launch his opponents a fair distance away or pierce through them. Gojo hits Sukuna with Black Flash. Black Flash: A phenomenon that occurs when the user applies cursed energy within 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit, creating a spatial distortion that causes their cursed energy to flash black and amplifies the destructive power of the strike to the power of 2.5.[34]Satoru first demonstrated his ability to use Black Flash againstSukunaduring their battle in Shinjuku, dealing a devastating strike when the King of Curses least expected it and knocking him unconscious.[35]Gojo has used Black Flash more times thanKento Nanamibut less times consecutively, though his record was eventually surpassed byYuji Itadori.[36]It is currently unknown how many times exactly Gojo has performed Black Flash, but he has used it at least four times."
What is the neutral form of the Limitless?,Infinity,Cursed technique,"Limitless: Limitless is an inherited technique of the Gojo family. This technique grants its users nigh-absolute control over space throughcursed energymanipulation at an atomic level,[37]resulting in multiple subsequent results and techniques within the overall ability. With the manipulation of space as just the base level of the technique, Limitless has three standard and one ""non-standard"" form beyond this. Infinity: Being the neutral form of the Limitless, the Infinity is commonly known as the ability to stop,[38]although this is a common misconception as the true power of the Infinity is to slow things down. When something attempts to hit Satoru, the person or object in question instead hits the infinity between himself and them.[39][40]According to Satoru, this is the convergence of an infinite series and comes straight from the paradox ofAchilles and the tortoise. Akin to the way Achilles will never catch the tortoise due to the potential, infinite amounts of finite space separating them or how the real number one will never touch the real number two due to the infinite amount of fractions that separate them, the opponent will never touch Satoru due to the infinity between them.[41] Satoru initially had to manually activate Infinity, and keeping it active for long periods of time tired him.[42]Since his third year at Jujutsu High, Satoru has programmed Infinity to be constantly active, and automatically target and protect him by discerning the danger levels of approaching objects based on their cursed energy intensity, mass, speed, and shape. While this would normally fatigue his brain, an efficient and constant usage ofreverse cursed techniqueallowed Gojo to keep his brain refreshed.[43] Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue: The reinforced version of the neutral limitless;[38]Blue is the byproduct of Gojo amplifying the Limitless with negative cursed energy, producing a vacuum. Through these, Gojo creates a scenario where the world itself is forced to correct itself and fill in the negative space, causing all matter in the range of the commanded space to be pulled together.[44] Cursed Technique Lapse - Maximum Cursed Energy Output: Blue: Satoru creates a center of gravity in a specific space capable of attracting all matter, crushing it all effortlessly akin to a black hole. He can also move the point of gravity at will, augmenting its destructive capabilities greatly.[45] Cursed Technique Reversal: Red[46]: Being an inversion of Blue, Red has the opposite effect. By flowing positive energy generated from reverse cursed technique into his Limitless technique,[47][48]Satoru inverts the properties of Blue and activates the divergence of Infinity, causing an extremely powerful repulsive force that blasts targets away. Red outputs at least twice as much as energy as Blue.[49] Reverse Cursed Technique: At first, while a first and second year student of Jujutsu High, Satoru was unable to grasp the complex nature of reverse cursed technique. After being put on his deathbed during his first fight with Toji Fushiguro, Satoru finally understood how to perform the technique and tapped into the core of cursed energy, granting him the ability to not only heal himself, but also make the positive energy flow into the Limitless, giving him access to his Red and Hollow Purple techniques.[51] During hisduelwithSukuna, Satoru survived the onslaught of slashes fromMalevolent Shrineby using reverse cursed technique at full power.[52]Additionally, Satoru further demonstrated his expertise with reverse cursed technique by using it to replenish his burned-out cursed technique, an unprecedented and seemingly impossible feat even for a talented sorcerer likeYuta Okkotsu.[53] Unlimited Void: Satoru's Domain Expansion. It creates a metaphysical space that causes the victims to receive all kinds of stimuli and information endlessly, restraining their thought processes and actions.[56]In terms of raw strength, Satoru's domain is equal to Sukuna's on the inside, only losing due to Malevolent Shrine's open domain that allowed Sukuna to destroy the barrier of Unlimited Void.[57]Satoru's skill with his Domain Expansion is so great that he can precisely activate it for only 0.2 seconds, limiting its lasting effect on those he traps within it,[58]and is able to freely change the conditions of Unlimited Void's barrier. Satoru himself and those he makes physical contact with are immune to its effect.[59] Six Eyes: An innate trait rarely inherited by individuals in the Gojo Clan, similar to the Limitless. These eyes grant their wielder incredible perception and precise control ofcursed energy. Even when they are completely obscured, the Six Eyes function like high-definition infrared vision, allowing the user to perceive their environment through the flow of cursed energy. These eyes also allow the user to see through a sorcerer's cursed technique and determine its nature.[60][41][61] The extremely precise manipulation of cursed energy granted by the Six Eyes allows the user to activate their cursed techniques with incredible levels of efficiency, resulting in almost zero cursed energy loss due to inefficiency, which lets the user use comparatively less cursed energy than others when activating the same techniques.[26]Consequently, the Six Eyes are essential for using and mastering the Limitless technique.[62]"

By 2035, he became the acting head of theGojo Clan."
How did Yuta feel about Toge Inumaki?,He was initially scared of Toge[8]until he realized how kind of a person he truly is and made an effort to establish a social connection,Personality,"""I want to believe that it's okay to keep living."" Yuta was a very timid and lonely boy who was bullied a lot while growing up. Due toRikahaunting much of his early life, Yuta was unable to connect with other people and has lost all confidence in himself. This makes it difficult for Yuta to interact with others, as they often scare him without meaning to, or he's just too shy to speak to them. Even so, Yuta genuinely cared about other people and decided to isolate himself from them even if it means remaining alone.Maki Zenincalled Yuta out for being a moody kid who's lived his entire life without goals.[6]He acknowledged that this was true and used her advice to gain a resolve for being a jujutsu sorcerer. This helps Yuta realize that deep down, he truly desires the confidence to feel like he belongs.[7] Yuta learning to understand and become friends with others. While his timid nature stays intact, Yuta slowly becomes more social and interacts with others normally. Even after early signs of improvement, Yuta still struggled to understand someone likeToge Inumaki. He was initially scared of Toge[8]until he realized how kind of a person he truly is and made an effort to establish a social connection.[9] Yuta's rage unleashed by the sight of his injured friends. Gaining friends helps Yuta gain confidence in himself and establish the goal to help set Rika free. He felt responsible for her turning into a curse in the first place[10]and worked extremely hard to find a way to help her. He pushed himself during training and took all his friends' and mentors' words to heart, showing a more determined side of himself.[11]At his core, Yuta wants to become someone who can help keep others out of danger. AgainstSuguru Geto, Yuta showed the darkest side of himself. Geto hurt Yuta's only friends, and the young man was more than willing to kill him for it.[12]Yuta's rage allowed him to even command Rika's power at will. He was willing to sacrifice his life to use Rika to kill Geto to avenge his friends, the only people who give him the confidence to continue living.[13] Yuta adopts an apathetic persona in order to deceive others into thinking he wants to kill Yuji Itadori. When Yuta returned to Jujutsu High after time away overseas, he was accompanied by a new Rika and it appeared as if he was lost in his darkness. He agreed to kill Gojo's other pupil,Yuji Itadorifor the higher-ups and claimed it was revenge for cutting off Toge's arm.[14]Yuta carried a deathly serious and cold persona who was straight to the point. He attempted to kill Yuji before so much as exchanging words and then apologized while committing the act.[15] However, this was all an act to help protect Yuji from the higher-ups. Yuta had to act a certain way to make it believable and he healed Yuji before the first-year died permanently. Even though Yuta has never met Yuji, he went out of his way to deceive authority and help Yuji because Gojo asked him to. Yuji is important to people who are precious to Yuta and that was more than enough reason for him to help. He also sympathizes with Yuji because he was in the exact same situation, up for execution bearing a power he could not hope to contain. Yuta doesn't blame Yuji forSukuna's actions.[16] Yuta sympathizes with Yuji's situation and protects him in Gojo's place. Without the false guise of a cold killer, Yuta is still a naturally friendly person who has developed a lot as a person. He's much more social and is less timid than he used to be. When Gojo visited Yuta in Africa, the outspoken teacher was surprised his student was even telling jokes.[17] Yuta assimilated comfortably back into interacting with his peers and dedicated himself to helping them. He agreed to help Megumi rescue his sister from theCulling Game. He also did his diligence as a senpai and agreed to stop Sukuna should he ever take control of Yuji's body again. Upon reuniting with Maki, Yuta was excited to see her and expressed concern about her injuries. Due to his absence in Shibuya, Yuta shoulders the responsibility of stopping Kenjaku alone. When it appeared as ifMaster Tengen's barrier had rejected their group, Yuta was concerned and quick to suggest they turn back because Megumi's sister didn't have time to waste.[18]Once Tengen allowed them inside and provided crucial information, Yuta agreed to enter the Culling Game right away by himself. He also suggested they getKinji Hakari's help despite his moodiness and was modest enough to say that Hakari's strength sometimes surpasses his own.[19] During the Culling Game, Yuta displayed his selflessness as well as his propensity to be ruthless. He had no gripes about killing enemy sorcerers to obtain the necessary points to help save Tsumiki. Yuta killed at least seven sorcerers before cutting downDhruv Lakdawallaand he targeted the latter simply because he was a danger to the public. He believed that any potential danger couldn't be allowed to leave the colony and only took out the other players when it was completely necessary. Yuta trying to understand why someone with great strength would act so desperately for their own sake. Not only did Yuta use his strength to score points, but he used it to protect people as well. He protected a group of civilians caught up in the Culling Game, serving as their guardian throughout the game despite the risk to himself. While trying to move them to safety, Yuta noticed a mother and her daughter struggling to go on. He insisted on carrying their belongings himself and changed his mind about moving the group, deciding they should take a break inside Dhruv's former territory where they'd be safe instead. When other civilians outside his group were threatened byKurourushi's cockroaches, Yuta didn't hesitate to try his best to save them.[20] Yuta holds some guilt about being unable to help his comrades in Shibuya. He's aware that everyone reached their limit after the Shibuya Incident and felt as if he needed to shoulder the responsibility to handle the Culling Game all on his own. This also extends to the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons where Yuta was unable to finish off Geto. Yuta doesn't want his beloved sensei to have to kill his best friend again. As a result, Yuta resolved not only to score four hundred points all on his own, but to kill Kenjaku himself as well.[21] ""Because I'm blessed."" Upon encounteringTakako UroandRyu Ishigori, two players who are dangerous but not necessarily evil, Yuta tried to reason with them. In Uro's case, Yuta tried to understand why she would kill so desperately for her own gain. He expressed that he understands why the powerless get desperate but doesn't get why someone strong like Uro would seek out pointless battles. Yuta only gained friends recently but he believes fighting to protect someone or something is the only reason to do so.[22]Uro rejected Yuta due to his lineage, but he still tried to help her understand that regardless of what the Fujiwara did to her, living selfishly will only get someone so far.[23] As for Ryu, the incarnated sorcerer expressed over four hundred years of yearning for a proper battle, and his sincerity managed to melt Yuta's heart. Although Yuta will likely never find any meaning in fighting, he indulged Ryu and gave him the fight he always desired.[24]Yuta spared both Ryu and Uro and ignored their ungrateful insults after the fight. When Ryu asked about Yuta's conversations with Uro, he explained that they could never come to terms simply because he's blessed. Yuta knows how fortunate he is to have friends and the power to protect them. Ryu suggested Yuta might've killed them if not for their points and while Yuta didn't deny it, he told Ryu to just be grateful to his comrades in the end.[25] Yuta has shown that he is not above using morally questionable and unethical means if the situation calls for it. This was seen during the preparations for the eventualraidonSukuna, where Yuta proposed taking over the body of Satoru Gojo with Kenjaku's cursed technique should he be killed. When some of his allies opposed the idea due to Yuta's importance, Yuta grew frustrated with their refusal to use unethical tactics to fight against Sukuna. He argued that they were inconsiderate of Gojo's constant burden of having to be a ""monster"", and declared that he will become a monster in order to win.[26]Yuta reiterated the same sentiment to Gojo personally while accompanying the latter to theJujutsu Headquartersto kill the higher-ups, telling his teacher that he does not have to be a monster alone."
How many special grade sorcerers were recognized by Jujutsu High?,four,Overview,"Yuta's presence when he was completely unable to control Rika. Overall Skill Level: Yuta is one of only four special grade sorcerers recognized by Jujutsu High.[27]While being haunted by Rika's vengeful spirit, Yuta was immediately registered as a special grade due to Rika's immense power, making him the most recent person to receive the ranking. Yuta was completely unaware of how to fight or control hiscursed energywhen Satoru threw him into his first mission. He relied on Maki until they were swallowed by a curse and it came down to Yuta to rescue everyone inside. Yuta was able to tap into his emotions and fully manifest Rika, ripping the other curse apart and freeing everyone. Yuta barely carried everyone outside the barrier but he used what little physical strength and stamina he had to finish the mission.[28] After training with Maki, Yuta becomes more capable with a katana. This made Yuta painfully aware of how weak he was, so Maki trained him on the basics of armed combat for three months before his next assignment. He was never able to land a hit on Maki but always trained hard to improve himself and started to move a lot better. However, in his second mission, an exorcism with Toge, Yuta still found himself relying on his classmate's skill. When a semi-grade 1 curse ambushed them, Toge was injured saving Yuta. Yuta stepped up on his own without relying on Rika and helped Toge exorcise it. Yuta's training allowed him to avoid most of the cursed spirit's attacks and he even landed a counterattack. It was just a shallow slash, however, due to the toughness of the curse and Yuta's poor cursed energy control at the time.[29] Apparently, during the 2017Goodwill Event, Yuta completely dominated all of theKyoto Jujutsu Highcompetitors, includingAoi Todo. There is no record of him fully manifesting Rika at that time but Maki noted she was still around and was likely the reason Yuta won the event.[30] Yuta converting emotions into strength while fighting alongside Rika. Continuing training throughout his tenure at Jujutsu High, Yuta continued to grow stronger and built a solid foundation as a sorcerer. On December 24, 2017, Suguru Geto targeted Yuta and injured his friends while invading the school. This set Yuta off, unleashing extraordinary levels of cursed energy throughout through his body. This resulted in a mighty increase of Yuta's physical abilities and fine-tuned of his senses.[31] Alongside Rika, Yuta was able to match Geto one-on-one. He revealed not only the ability to use the extremely rare reverse cursed technique but the capacity to copy other cursed techniques likecursed speechas well. This led Geto to claim he was glad that he attacked Yuta before the student learned to properly wield Rika's power. Yuta was only able to defeat Geto by vowing to give his life in exchange for removing the limiters on Rika's boundless power, ultimately overpoweringMaximum: UzumakiandTamamo-no-Mae Incarnate.[32]The major difference in their battle was that Yuta was willing to give his life to win while the cursed manipulator didn't have the vast majority of his curses, with over four thousand serving the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons.[33] Yuta and Rika fighting in sync to combat the extraordinarily dangerous Geto. Following his victory, Yuta discovered he was the one who cursed Rika when they were young, not the other way around. He is a descendant ofMichizane Sugawara, one of the greatest sorcerers to ever live, making Yuta a distant relative of theGojo clan. Yuta severed the bond tying servant to master and Rika didn't desire to punish him, so the curse was broken, freeing Orimoto's soul.[34] Yuta originally thought that after Rika passed away he wouldn't be able to be a sorcerer anymore.[35]Kenjakubelieves that Yuta's vast cursed energy and his ability to copy cursed techniques were tied to detaining his loved one's soul.[36]However, these are incorrect assumptions and Satoru Gojo has stated on more than one occasion that Yuta still has the potential to surpass him.[37][38] Yuta taking out cursed spirits on his own upon returning to action. By March of 2018, only three months after the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons, Yuta regained his rank as a special grade sorcerer. He is a prodigy who boasts incredible power and unusual abilities second only to Satoru Gojo.[39]Satoru forced Geto's comrade, Miguel, to train Yuta. Miguel mentored Yuta overseas while they searched for theBlack Rope. By the time he returned to Tokyo following the Shibuya Incident, Yuta was able to dispatch large cursed spirits without much effort.[40] Upon arriving to executeSukuna's vessel, Yuta was recognized as a major threat to everyone.Yuji,Choso, andNaoya, three strong jujutsu users, were all briefly stricken by Yuta's unsettling cursed energy. Naoya, who especially prides himself on his abilities, was quick to ally himself with Yuta in order to avoid any potential conflict. Choso, another special grade, told Yuji to run away immediately because he could feel Yuta's overwhelming strength is on a scale similar to Satoru Gojo's, ensuring death.[41] Yuta's overwhelming offense leaving Yuji with no choice but to dodge. Following Choso's advice to get away from Yuta, Yuji attempted to flee but Yuta was able to run him down and engage his target one-on-one. Due to what occurred inShibuya, Yuji was holding himself back, and Yuta was easily able to overpower him.[42]Yuta displayed more overall cursed energy then their sensei as well as reinforcement techniques far beyond an elite sorcerer. Yuji's normal reinforcement was no match for the amount Yuta was enhancing his own body with, leading the former to evade attacks most of the fight.[43]Following his victory, Yuta found Choso after he defeated Naoya and knocked him unconscious with a single blow.[44] In addition to mastering close combat skills, Yuta has become a proficient user of reverse cursed technique. After executing Yuji, Yuta instantly restarted his heart by outputting positive energy into him. His ability to output positive energy at will is something even Satoru is unable to do.[45][46] Yuta overpowering a special grade curse without using the full extent of his abilities. Yuta only showcased a small portion of his abilities against Yuji and yet his very presence intimidated the likes of Naoya and Choso. He displayed the full extent of his powers during the Culling Game, where Yuta was matched up against some of the strongest players the deadly battle royal had to offer. He effortlessly dispatchedDhruv Lakdawalla, an incarnated sorcerer who once conquered Japan, single-handedly shattering the four-way deadlock in the Sendai Colony.[47]Yuta likely could've also made short work of Kurourushi if he had chosen to use reverse cursed technique from the beginning. However, Yuta handicapped himself to avoid displaying his abilities to those observing him and still managed to overpower the cockroach curse in multiple exchanges.[48]Yuta was eventually cornered and nearly defeated but he ultimately exorcised the curse using a calculated maneuver that blasted Kurourushi's head with positive energy.[49] Yuta using his full power to fight alongside Rika. Yuta put up fierce resistance against Takako Uro and Ryu Ishigori directly after defeating Kurourushi. He used reverse cursed technique and his cursed energy manipulation to survive their attacks but could hardly go on the offensive against their cursed techniques. In order to ensure victory, Yuta went all out and showcased the full extent of his abilities.[50]Utilizing Rika and his full skillset, Yuta completely took over the momentum of the battle and overpowered both his opponents, forcing them to rely on domain expansion. Yuta cast his own domain in response, displaying his capacity to use the supreme jujutsu art as well.[51]Even after the domain struggle resulted in everyone being unable to use cursed techniques for a limited time, Yuta still excelled and was directly involved in eliminating Uro and Kurourushi's offspring from the fight. Yuta's advanced reinforcement techniques gave him an edge over Uro and his positive energy was used to easily dispatch Kurourushi's offspring.[52] Yuta giving Ryu the fight of a lifetime. Ryu proved to not only be the strongest among the participants of the four-way deadlock but the toughest opponent for Yuta as well. His cursed energy output could even bypass Yuta's toughness and his directed blasts were far superior to Yuta and Rika's. Yuta was able to achieve victory due to his growth as a fighter, made abundant by his tactical awareness and the ability to contend with the experience of a four-hundred-year-old being like Ryu. By copying Uro's power to control space, Yuta turned his opponent's own destructive force against him. Even without Rika backing him up, Yuta bought enough time for his plan to succeed by matching Ryu in close combat. Once Yuta was victorious, Ryu proudly admitted that Yuta gave him the most satisfying fight he's ever had, proving that Yuta's strength surpasses that of the vast majority of jujutsu sorcerers, past or present.[53]"
What weapon did Yuta use to defeat Dhruv Lakdawalla?,katana,Physical prowess,"Yuta slicing his way through a swarm of curses. Expert Weapons Specialist: While first training as a sorcerer, Yuta was given a katana mainly as an object to stabilize his cursed energy.[54]Through vigorous training with Maki, the most proficient cursed tool user at Jujutsu High, Yuta became decent with a sword, able to hold his own against cursed spirits[55]and even Geto, who has exceptional physical prowess.[56] Yuta effortlessly executing a powerful sorcerer with his katana. Yuta has continued to hone his skill as a swordsman and still wields a katana as his weapon of choice. His skills have improved dramatically and are perfectly balanced with his enhanced cursed energy manipulation, allowing Yuta to wield a blade with superhuman physical prowess. He's fast and makes decisive attacks that Yuji could barely avoid. The blade is constantly surging with cursed energy just like the rest of Yuta's body, giving it superior cutting power. He defeated a large cursed spirit with a diving stab so powerful it cracked the ground beneath them.[57] Yuta cut down Dhruv Lakdawalla using his katana[58]and fought on even terms with Kurourushi using it as well.[59]Rika has gained the ability to store cursed tools, implying Yuta is now capable of utilizing a wide variety of weapons. He chose a steel arm attachment to fight Takako Uro and used it to further reinforce his close combat skills.[60] Yuta leaning on his close combat prowess. Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Yuta has grown into a very capable hand-to-hand combatant who is more than comfortable engaging his opponent's up close. He generally throws single powerful smashing blows that can crush his opponent in a single move. A mere front kick to Yuji's sternum was enough to send him reeling back and one backhand from Yuta knocked Choso out cold. Yuta employs hand-to-hand combat consistently against extraordinary opponents in the Culling Game. He used his katana to disarm Kurorushi before hitting the special grade cockroach curse with a powerful backfist.[61]Yuta fought the early stages of his battle with Takako Uro and Ryu Ishigori entirely barehanded against their powerful cursed techniques."
"How did Yuta fool the jujutsu higher-ups by ""killing"" Yuji?",stopping Yuji's heart and immediately healing him with reverse cursed technique,Intelligence,"High Tactical Intellect: Yuta is a smart individual but was initially a complete novice sorcerer and could hardly apply his intellect to battle. However, he's always had a good idea of his skillset and how to best use it. When he and Toge were faced with a semi-grade 1 curse, Yuta was aware he couldn't win on his own and focused on restoring Toge's cursed speech so he could exorcise it. Yuta fooling the jujutsu higher-ups by ""killing"" Yuji. Currently, Yuta is entirely capable of solving most conflicts with brute force, but now he has the experience to properly apply his intellect to battle. He also uses his wits to navigate other situations in the jujutsu world, such as when he was selected to execute Yuji. Yuta entered a binding vow with higher-ups and managed to fool them by stopping Yuji's heart and immediately healing him with reverse cursed technique. He was aware very few people knew about his ability to output positive energy and that Yuji had ""died"" and returned to life before. Thanks to his act, Yuta fooled the higher-ups and took Yuji off their radar.[62] Yuta defeating Ryu with his own attack. Yuta displayed his cleverness and intellect in battle when he was faced with exceptionally strong fighters in the Culling Game. While being observed by other players, Yuta knew it was in his best interest not to display his full power. He did his best to try to avoid using Rika and reverse cursed technique while fighting Kurourushi, only doing so when his life was in immediate danger.[63]While trying to restrain showcasing his own strengths, Yuta was keen on figuring out his opponents. After a quick exchange with Takako Uro, Yuta was able to grasp the basics of her complex innate technique.[64]Ryu's wide attack range led Yuta to close the distance and bring their battle in close. While approaching Ryu, Yuta fooled his opponent by using a hole in the path toward his opponent that he created early to create the perception he had been struck down.[65] At full strength, Yuta applies his intellect to ensure an efficient victory. His heightened fight awareness enabled him to counter Takako's ability to redirect attacks by using cursed speech to immobilize her first.[66]He also immediately noticed her concern over Kurourushi and utilized it to land an unguarded hit, ultimately leading to her defeat.[67]Yuta defeated Ryu by copying Takako's technique and using it to redirect his own blast back at him, an attack the latter never saw coming.[68]"
What is the name of the person who transforms a loved one into a cursed spirit?,Yuta,Cursed energy,"Cursed Energy Capacity: Yuta's immense cursed energy comes from his genetic relation to Michizane Sugawara. It only first manifested when he transformed a loved one into a cursed spirit. Rika became a vengeful spirit so powerful that Geto, an avid collector of curses, dubbed her the ""Queen of Curses."" Rika's boundless cursed energy could be shaped into any technique, allowing Yuta to use advanced curse techniques within a year of learning the fundamentals of jujutsu.[69] ""His whole body including his katana is constantly surging with cursed energy!"" Yuta retains the massive amounts of cursed energy that were unraveled from Rika's curse even after her spirit passed on. His cursed energy capacity exceeds even that of Satoru Gojo.[70]Yuji and Choso could immediately feel that Yuta's volume of cursed energy was comparable with Gojo, with the former claiming it was more creepy and ominous.[71][72]Ryu Ishigori, the Culling Game player with the highest cursed energy output, felt Yuta's cursed energy was nearly bottomless.[73] Cursed Energy Manipulation: In his second year as a sorcerer, Yuta improved his cursed energy control dramatically. Yuta understands that he carries vast levels of cursed energy and now knows how to apply it accordingly. He has been training his weak body and constantly strengthens it in battle with massive amounts of cursed energy. This puts Yuta's reinforcement technique on a level that far surpasses even an elite sorcerer's, making his attacks difficult to predict. Not only are Yuta's attacks unpredictable upon reading his cursed energy, but his physical capabilities are enhanced tremendously. Yuta's strength and agility are improved to such a degree that he can contend with Yuji's superhuman prowess. Yuta's every attack carries enough destructive power to end a fight and his defense is so dense that it can restrict all incoming damage to a minimum.[74] In addition to his superior reinforcement technique, another testament to Yuta's delicate control over his cursed energy is his mastery over positive energy. Reverse cursed technique is notoriously difficult to perform for sorcerers but Yuta can use it repeatedly without issue. Yuta's releasing a shockwave with a swing of his sword. Cursed Energy Output: While not on the level of Ryu Ishigori, Yuta can unleash exceptional levels of cursed energy with his attacks. A single swing of his cursed energy charged katana created a blastwave so powerful it completely annihilated an entire swarm of Kurourushi's cockroaches. Yuta also has the unique ability to convert positive energy into output and imbue his attacks with it as well. Cursed Energy Reinforcement: Yuta compensates for his small physical frame by strengthening himself with cursed energy. This reinforcement to his physical power is enough to put him on par with Yuji's superhuman strength. When Yuji punched a car at Yuta, he was able to throw it right back at him. A mere front kick to Yuji's sternum was enough to send him reeling back[75]and one backhand from Yuta knocked Choso out cold.[76][77]While fighting in the Sendai Colony, Yuta effortlessly ripped a steel railing from the side of the road and threw it at Kurourushi[78]. He also threw a downward punch at Ryu Ishigori so ferocious that despite being blocked with cursed energy, the impact created a larger crater in the ground.[79] Yuta's fortified body shattering the ground. Improving his muscles' performance with cursed energy allows Yuta to greatly increase his speed, agility, and maneuverability. He can keep pace with Yuji's superhuman speed even with a drawn katana.[80]While closing the distance across Sendai in his fight with Ryu Ishigori, Yuta ran at incredible speed across an open area. He was able to perform acrobatic spins and parkour moves across the environment that helped him evade Ryu's cursed energy beams.[81] Thoroughly fortifying his body with cursed energy has made Yuta extremely tough. He can leap from the top of a building and crumble the side of the road from the impact without doing any damage to himself.[82]Coupled with his ability to heal himself, Yuta comes off as near invulnerable to even the strongest assault. He tanked several blastwaves from Takako Uro and Ryu Ishigori's Granite Blast head-on without sustaining and prolonged injuries.[83]Proper defensive martial arts made him able to withstand Ryu's explosive cursed energy output. Ryu compares hitting Yuta to knocking against a massive water tank.[84]Yuta was even able to deflect one of Ryu's beams with his bare hands and kept fighting after suffering several direct hits from Ryu and Uro. This made Uro recognize how tough Yuta is. Consistently reinforcing his body and healing it with reverse cursed technique helped Yuta stay in the fight, but it was still draining on his stamina and overall cursed energy.[85] Yuta unleashing Black Flash against Geto. Black Flash: A phenomenon that creates a spatial distortion when a user connects an impact of cursed energy within 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit, causing cursed energy to flash black, creating a more potent attack to the power of 2.5 of the hit. Yuta achieved a Black Flash for the first time against Suguru Geto during theNight Parade of a Hundred Demons.[86]"
What does Yuta use to make the Snake Eyes and Fangs insignia appear on his mouth as if he was born with it?,cursed speech,Cursed techniques,"Yuta has since become more proficient with cursed speech. While connected to Rika through the ring, Yuta can even make the Snake Eyes and Fangs insignia appear on his mouth as if he was born with it. This allows him to activate the technique by speaking commands in the same manner that Toge does.[94] G Warstaff: Yuta has replicatedCharles Bernard's technique that allows him to see a target's future by attaching a manga panel to them and drawing blood from them. Unlike Charles, Yuta does not use a pen-like spear cursed tool to fulfil the conditions for ink, and instead uses his own katana sword. The precognition granted by G Warstaff allowed Yuta to see Sukuna's future movements and land a heavy blow on him.[100] Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue: By amplifying the Infinity with more cursed energy, the user can infinitely converge space at a chosen location to create a magnetic effect that pulls in the surroundings.[104]Yuta attempted to use this technique against Sukuna, but was interrupted when the King of Curses approached him before he could activate the technique.[105]He later successfully used Blue to pull a voice recorder into his domain.[106] Reverse Cursed Technique:When faced with the dire injuries of his friends, Yuta was able to tap into the core of his cursed energy and unlock the ability to heal their injures with reverse cursed technique. He did so after less than a year's worth of experience in jujutsu. While most sorcerers can't use reverse cursed technique and much less can output it on others, Yuta was able to learn to do both.[110] Since first using it to heal his friends, Yuta has become a highly proficient user of reverse cursed technique. Yuta was able to apply it to Yuji at the same time he stopped his heart to prevent a permanent death. Shortly after, he healed Naoya of his injuries and removed Choso's poison, which takes a higher level reverse cursed technique.[111][112]While fighting in the Culling Game, Yuta used reverse cursed technique constantly to heal himself after getting hit by any big move. This helped him avoid long-term damage but severely drained his cursed energy. He also used it to exorcise Kurourushi, compromising the cursed spirit's body with a blast of positive energy."

Cursed Energy Manipulation: Yuta had very poor understanding of cursed energy or how to control it upon enrolling at Jujutsu High. The focus of his early training was to stabilize his cursed energy by channeling Rika's power into his ring and then into his katana. He had a lot of trouble with this and asked his peers for help. While fighting Geto, Yuta was running on lots of adrenaline and more cursed energy than he had experienced up to that point. While he was able to fight with reinforced flesh on a high level, Yuta accidentally broke his katana by imbuing excessive cursed energy into it.[115] Rika's complete manifestation. Special Grade Vengeful SpiritRika: When Yuta and Rika Orimoto were children, Yuta accidentally cursed Rika's death by consciously rejecting it. This transformed Rika into an immensely powerful vengeful spirit, who only ever fully manifested twice, but is known to be one of the most powerful cursed spirits to have ever existed. Yuta didn't know how to control Rika as she haunted him through his early years. She was extremely overprotective of him out of love, what Satoru believes is the most twisted curse of all. Rika would partially manifest her arms and attack anyone who was too aggressive with Yuta.[116]Her massive amounts of cursed energy directly fed Yuta's abilities and could be molded into any cursed technique. Fully manifesting the first time, Rika tore a large cursed spirit to pieces with little effort. Unleashing her power at full force, Rika was able to contend with every cursed spirit in Geto's arsenal at the time. Beyond the limits of her power, Rika was able to overpower Geto'smaximum technique.[117] Rika Orimoto's curse was successfully broken and her soul unbound from the ties of cursed energy, allowing her to pass away to the afterlife. However, Rika's form as a cursed spirit remained with Yuta as a different entity altogether."

Kirito described the appearance of his avatar at the beginning of the game and the beta-testing phase as having the appearance of a ridiculously handsome protagonist from some fantasy animation, looking noticeably older than he actually was.[11]His in-game height was equal to that of his height in the real world to prevent the extra height from hindering his movements.[12] In the full version of the game, during Kayaba Akihiko's tutorial, all player avatars were changed to reflect their real life appearances. After this change, Kirito's SAO avatar had slightly long but neat black hair and black eyes. His delicate face showed no trace of masculinity, allowing people to easily mistake him for a girl.[12][13] During episodes 4-6 Kirito wore a a navy-blue jacket with studded blue shoulders and a long hem, dark grey pants, brown boots, a Golden Chest Plate with a Cresent Moon engraved in the middle, a grey shirt and Black Fingerless Glove, Kirito's clothes later in the game consisted of black pants with a black belt that had a large silver buckle, a black V-necked shirt that was worn underneath a black trench-coat with gray lining going down the sleeves, and black boots with silver plates to protect his shins. He had a silver plate worn on the left side of his coat, and a pair of black fingerless gloves. He wore a strap that went over his right shoulder and under it to wrap around his left side.[14]In the last months of the game, he used «Elucidator» and «Dark Repulser» as his main weapons. After being defeated by Heathcliff in a publicdueland being forced to join his guild, Kirito donned the red and white uniform of the Knights of the Blood.[15] At the beginning ofProject Alicization, Kirito wore a hand-sewn pale blue short-sleeved shirt with a V-shaped cut on the chest which was tied with a light brown cord along with trousers and hand-sewn leather shoes.[16]Two years later, after he became a valet in theSword Mastery Academy, he wore the standard gray uniform, like all first years and non-elite swordsmen do.[17][18]In the second year of the academy, after he became one of the twelve elite swordsmen in the academy and was allowed to choose a color for his uniform, he wore a pitch black uniform.[19]"
What is Kazuto's relationship to Lisbet and Sinon?,he can appear to be rude to others,Personality,"Kazuto is someone who is not good with words, as stated byKlein,[citation needed]and can be quite direct.[citation needed]This is due to him not having many friends and closing others off because of his love for computers.[citation needed]Thus, he can appear to be rude to others, such asLisbethandSinon.[citation needed]Sometimes, he actually seems to enjoy angering and teasing people as well.[citation needed]Also, from time to time, Kazuto can be quite overconfident thinking he can do things others cannot.[citation needed] Kazuto is almost always a calm and collected character, rarely showing any signs of distress. When Kayaba Akihiko announced that Sword Art Online had become a Death Game, Kirito was able to quickly accept the new conditions of the game and take immediate action to increase his chances of survival. However, Kazuto is actually a kind person, willing to sacrifice himself to help others. When the death of Diavel during the 1st Floor Boss battle resulted in players accusing Kirito of withholding information as a beta tester that led to their leader's death, he decided to become a scapegoat by naming himself a Beater to distance himself from the average beta tester, ensuring that they would not become victims of unfounded hate by drawing all the ire of the players onto himself. He also tends to comfort others when they experience hardship, such asSilicaafter she lostPina. Kazuto is also a very emotional person and lets his emotions control him from time to time. The deaths ofSachiand the Moonlit Black Cats had haunted him until his marriage with Asuna in Sword Art Online. Sachi's death, in particular, had a huge effect on his personality and motives, making him very distant from others for a while. Kirito also temporarily lost his will to live when Asuna was killed by Heathcliff. Kazuto is a person with incredibly strong resolve, willing to do anything and everything in his power to accomplish something that is important to him without any hesitation. When Asuna was being held in ALfheim, Kirito was bound and determined to set her free and immediately attempted to fly upWorld TreewhenYuiconfirmed that she detected Asuna being at its top, despite this being an impossible task. He also attempted to fight his way to the top by himself twice despite being annihilated the first time. After escaping Sword Art Online, Kazuto attempted to atone for his past mistakes, such as mending his relationship with his cousinSuguha, whom he had ignored before becoming trapped in the death game."
What did Kirito do after completing the quest?,forming apartyand,Aincrad arc,"Kirito and Klein seeing each other's real life appearance. Shortly after logging in to the fully released SAO, Kirito was stopped by a stranger. Klein, a new guy, asks for his help in learning how to play. After befriending each other and training in the fields for several hours, they were forcefully teleported back to theTown of Beginnings, to receive an announcement from Kayaba Akihiko. He revealed that the lack of a logout function, which they had recently realized, was a ""feature"" of his new game, and that forced removal of the NerveGear headpiece from the other side would fry the person's brain using microwaves. Kirito heading to the next town. The only means to escape was to clear the game, in other words, to successfully defeat all 100 floors ofAincradand defeat the final boss. Kirito immediately took Klein and ran off, and after hearing that Klein would remain with his friends here, left him and headed off to thenext town. Kirito spent the first day making his way to the next village. He decided to completea quest, which he knew of from the beta period, to obtain a new sword. During thisquesthe encountered another player, a beta tester namedCoper, who proposed forming apartyand completing the quest together. After killing many «Little Nepenthes», two more Nepenthes, one with the required item and another with a fruit, appeared. Kirito killed the one carrying the flower while Coper intentionally kills the one with the fruit while triggering the fruit, which caused many Little «Nepenthes» to swarm on their position. Kirito managed to escape, but Coper, who did not know that his «Hiding» skill would not work against monsters that did not rely on sight, died. This caused Kirito's mortality to weigh heavily on him. At around 04:00 on December 2, 2022, nearly a month since the start of the official service of the game, Kirito encountered a hooded player fighting aRuin Kobold Trooperon the nineteenth level of the1stFloor's Labyrinth. While amazed by the player's brilliant skill with a rapier, the former beta tester hesitated before revealing himself to the fencer after the fight to comment on the inefficiency of usingSword Skillson a nearly dead enemy. During his conversation with the hooded player, Kirito realised that he was speaking to a girl based on her voice, and was astonished by her disregard for her self-preservation, the time she had spent in the Labyrinth, and the condition of her equipment. When the player collapsed just before she could leave, the swordsman carried her to the forest outside of the Labyrinth and waited for her to recover. Seven hours later, the girl awoke, desiring to return to the Labyrinth again, thus Kirito suggested going to the First Floor Boss Strategy conference atTolbanainstead, if she truly wished to beat the game, instead of just dying pointlessly. Having arrived at Tolbana, Kirito informed the hooded player that the meeting would take place at the town square at 16:00, before they momentarily parted ways. Immediately afterward, Kirito encountered theArgothe information broker, who notified him that the person interested in his «Anneal Blade+6» had raised his offer to 29,800Cor; however, Kirito again refused to sell his sword, wondering why Argo's client was so persistent. Kirito later found and joined the player from the Labyrinth, they both began to eat their bread. Kirito gave her a pot of cream and later explained how he had obtained the item and offered to give tips on how to gain the item efficiently, but the player quickly rejected his offer, stating that she did not come to the town to eat good food. Kirito questioned why she was in the town and listened to her explanation. After the clarification, Kirito began to apologize but was interrupted by the clock bell. The player realized that the meeting was about to start so they both headed to the conference. The meeting was organized by a player namedDiavel. Forty-four people went to the meeting and decide to try to defeat the 1stFloor boss, discovered in Argo's strategy guide to beIllfang the Kobold Lord. As the members gathered themselves into parties at Diavel's suggestion, Kirito and the mysterious fencer found themselves without a group. Kirito offered to form a party with the female player and was accepted, upon which he learned her name was Asuna. They were assigned to support E group, charged with clearing themonstersthat accompanied the boss. After the meeting, upon learning of Asuna's complete ignorance of MMO game mechanics, Kirito offered to explain MMO terms and strategies to her in detail so as to improve her chances of survival, but she requested the lesson to take place where they would not be seen. As Kirito considered several possible locations, Asuna revealed she had been sleeping in cheap inns that made sleeping less than ideal. Kirito disclosed that there were other rooms outside of inns that could be rented and described at length the details of his own rented room, but was suddenly seized by Asuna when he divulged that it had a bath. Confused at her response, he finally realized her intention when she requested the location of other such rooms with baths, but he had to reveal that there were no others, as he had rented the entire space and he could not cancel his transaction. At that moment, he was asked to lend his bathroom. At the farmhouse where Kirito had rented his space, he showed the bathroom to Asuna and warned her that the NerveGear could not adequately recreate a liquid environment. As he waited for Asuna, he focused all his willpower to not look at the bathroom door and tried to read Argo's strategy guide. At that moment, he was visited by Argo, from whom he learnt that her client had raised his offer for Kirito's Anneal Blade to 39,800 Cor. Shocked at how the buyer was willing to spend so much money on his sword when it would easier and cheaper to acquire a similar sword, Kirito requested the name of Argo's client, and was surprised to learn it was Kibaou. Pondering on the reason behind Kibaou's actions, Kirito was late to realize that Argo intended to use the bathroom to change her equipment. A few seconds after the info broker entered the bath and Asuna exited, Kirito lost consciousness. The next day on December 4, when the boss raid party gathered in Tolbana for the upcoming boss battle, Kirito was approached by Kibaou, who gruffly ordered him and Asuna to only engage stray Ruin Kobold Sentinels during the battle. As Kibaou was walking away, Kirito suddenly noticed that Kibaou had not spent the money offered for the former's Anneal Blade to upgrade his equipment instead, causing Kirito to become suspicious, but his thoughts were interrupted when, at that moment, Diavel began his speech to the raid party. Several hours later, the raid group finally reached the doors to the boss room. Before the battle began, Kirito reminded Asuna to aim her Sword Skills at the throats of the Ruin Kobold Sentinels after he secured an opening. Resolving to ensure Asuna's survival, he faced the doors and followed the other raid members as they charged into the boss room and commenced battle with Illfang and his guards. All went well until Illfang's lasthit point bar reached its last third. Instead of a talwar, as he originally carried in the Beta, he now carried anodachi. In this turn of events, Diavel was heavily wounded and subsequently died, after Kirito realized that Diavel had been a beta tester as well. Kirito then reorganized the shocked players and, with Asuna, worked together to take down the boss. After an intense battle, one of the tanks made a mistake and triggered Illfang'sTsumujiguruma. Kirito quickly countered the attack withSonic Leap, causing the boss to tumble and allowing everyone to attack in full force while the boss was recovering. However, just as the boss's HP neared depletion, it recovered while the tanks were still recovering from their post-motion delays, prompting Kirito and Asuna to finish off the boss themselves. Kirito finally managed to deal theLast Attackon the boss and gained a unique item from it, theCoat of Midnight. Kirito declaring himself as a Beater. However, as the raid party celebrated their victory,someonefrom Group C brought up the death of Diavel and blamed Kirito for withholding information which led to Diavel's death. Kirito then realized that the beta testers needed to make peace with the regular players before the beta tester hatred went out of hand. Therefore, Kirito created a new category of players, calledBeaters, who were the only ones withholding information for their own benefit and dubbed himself as one them, so that all of the hate and rage would be focused on him rather than upon all beta testers. After this announcement, Kirito decided to open the2ndFloorand activate itsTeleport Gate. However, while he was enjoying the view of the floor, Asuna followed him to show her gratitude, as well as to relay two worded messages fromAgiland Kibaou. After Kirito parted with Asuna once again, he received a message from Argo about his infamous speech. She wished to compensate him for the trouble she had caused by allowing a one-time free offer on any piece of information, thus Kirito mischievously replied by asking for the meaning behind her painted whiskers. Several minutes after parting with Asuna, Kirito reached the town ofUrbus. While hiding from the players entering through the Teleport Gate that he had just opened, Kirito saw Argo running from two male players and decided to follow them using hisTrackingmod. Once he reached them in an area outside of town, he identified that the two players were part of aguildfrom the beta test period that simulated being ninjas. Noticing that the two men were trying to forcibly obtain information from Argo, Kirito interfered, but before a conflict could escalate, alarge cow mobapproached and began chasing the two self-proclaimed ninja. In the aftermath, Kirito jokingly reminded Argo about his desire to know about her whiskers, but when it seemed that Argo would show him her whisker-less face, Kirito panicked and instead inquired about the hidden skill the two ninja were interested in. After Kirito promised not to hold Argo accountable for the consequences of the quest, Kirito was led to the questNPCfor the Martial ArtsExtra Skill. Only after Kirito accepted the quest given did he discover that the goal was to break a rock that was near unbreakable and that whisker markers would be drawn on his face until he could complete the quest. Thus, he realized that the reason why Argo kept the markings, even after the beta test period, was because it had become a part of her image. After three days and three nights of working on the quest, Kirito finally completed it and obtained the Martial Arts skill. While Kirito visited the town of Urbus looking for a blacksmith toenhancehis «Anneal Blade» to +7, he found Asuna and the two of them watched a discussion between two players because one of them, the blacksmithNezha, failed four consecutive times to enhance theother's weapon. Kirito decided to help Asuna gather more materials to enhance herWind Fleuret, so they made a bet to kill the mostWindwaspsfaster, which Kirito lost and had to treat her to dinner. Asuna chose a restaurant that he knew, and after exiting, they found out that they had received a luckbuff, so he took Asuna to the blacksmith to try to enhance her weapon. Although it had a 97% success, the enhancement failed and the weapon seemingly dissipated. After calming Asuna and taking her to an inn, Kirito returned outdoors and followed Nezha into a bar, where he encountered him talking tosome friendsabout business. Kirito noticed something, ran to Asuna's inn, abruptly entered her room, made her materialize all her items, and at the bottom of the item pile, he uncovered her Wind Fleuret. Upon figuring out Nezha's scam, Kirito donned a suit of armor to conceal his identity, approached Nezha and asked for a weapon upgrade. After Nezha seemingly destroyed his weapon and began apologizing, Kirito revealed himself and retrieved his sword with the One-Handed Sword mod, Quick Change. Following the defeat of Asterius the Taurus King, Kirito and Asuna climbed up to the3rdFloor, during which the former revealed human enemies using Sword Skills would begin appearing from this Floor onward. Distracted by a consequent discussion over the referral of SAO's titular Sword Arts clashing against each other as a concerto of life and death, the boy fell backwards through the doors at the top of the stairs, after which he messaged Argo that the 2ndFloor had been cleared and the 3rdFloor would be opened shortly. Then Kirito turned to his partner, proposing to take a detour through theforestinstead of going straight to themain city. After a brief encounter withone of the forest's denizens, the two followed the sound of clashing blades to the southwest of their position for under five minutes under Kirito's request. There, the duo found two NPCs, a Forest Elven man and a Dark Elven woman, locked in combat. Kirito explained to Asuna that the two characters were questgivers for acampaign questthat lasted until the 9thFloor, but warned that they could choose only one of the questlines, with no possibility of changing their choice afterwards. The two decided to follow the same route Kirito had chosen in the beta and assist the Dark Elf namedKizmel. Before entering the battle, Kirito informed Asuna that it was impossible for them to defeat the Forest Elf, thus he recommended focusing on defence until the Dark Elf used a special attack to end the battle upon half of their hit points being depleted, withholding the fact that the Dark Elf would die in the process. When the two stepped into the clearing, Kirito and Asuna ignored the elves' order to leave and pointed their blades at the Forest Elf. As the elf directed his aggression towards them, the swordsman reminded his partner to prioritize defense, but grew uneasy at seeing a determined expression on the fencer's face. Twenty minutes later, to his surprise, they managed to defeat the Forest Elf just before their hit points could reach the halfway point. After a moment of shock, Kirito gingerly directed the girls' attention to the bag of sewn leaves containing the Jade Key quest item that the Forest Elf had dropped on his death. Once Kizmel retrieved the bag, he and Asuna were thanked for their assistance and invited to accompany her to the Dark Elf Base, where they would be rewarded by the Dark Elf Commander for their help. After fifteen minutes of hiking and fighting monsters along the way, the trio reached the Dark Elf Base, hidden by a Forest-Sinking Charm. Once the players were rewarded by the Dark Elf commander, they initiated the next quest in the campaign and joined Kizmel in her tent for sleep at 19:00 after a bath and dinner. Early the next morning on December 15 eight hours later, Kirito's party left the camp for the second part of the questline. During their search for the Queen Spider's Cave, the three were forced to fight twoThicket Spiders, after defeating which the group decided to head in the direction from which the monsters had appeared to locate their nest. Following several more battles against the spiders, Kirito, Asuna, and Kizmel found the cave that served as their nest. But as they were about to finish investigating the cave's first floor for their quest, the group noticed that Kibaou,an ax-wielding player in a chain coif, and four other members of the Aincrad Liberation Squad had entered the cave as part of the guild creation quest, prompting the trio to hide until the players reached the stairs to the second floor. However, moments after the party located a Dark Elf scout brooch required for their quest, they overheard Kibaou's party retreating fromNephila Regina, the queen spider boss of the nest. Kirito's group decided to assist the fleeing party by discreetly defeating the boss, acquiring the queen spider's poison fang in the process. Having returned to the Dark Elf Base just before dawn, Kirito and Asuna delivered both the scout's emblem and the queen spider's fang to the commander to complete their quest. After receiving their rewards from the quest and then having anew rapierforged for Asuna, the duo elected to return to the main town of Zumfut. While navigating their way to the city, Kirito and Asuna found Lind, a swordsman in a chain coif, and three other members of the Dragon Knights Brigade fighting alongside the Forest Elf questgiver for the Jade Key quest against a different Dark Elf. Once Lind's party completed the quest, the boy and the girl resumed their trek to the town. Arriving there at around 10:00, they slept for two hours before accepting quests to level up. Having managed to complete their quests before 17:00, the pair attended the Clearers' strategy meeting for the 3rdFloor, after which they traveled back to the Dark Elf Base. For the next three days, Kirito and Asuna remained at the Dark Elf Base while strengthening themselves and completing the Elf War campaign, pausing only to participate in the battle against the Field Boss The Indolent Treent on December 18. Having returned to the camp later that afternoon, they resumed working on several more quests with Kizmel's assistance for four hours before retiring for the night. Two hours later at 23:45, the boy awoke and surreptitiously journeyed to the staircase pavilion linking the 3rdand 2ndFloors for a private rendezvous with Argo. After paying the information broker for her services, he learned only one player had joined the newly-formedDragon Knights Brigade since the 3rdFloor's opening: a metal coif-wearing swordsman named Morte who had been inducted into the guild by Lind himself. However, he had not been present at the previous strategy meeting or anywhere near the DKB's temporary base in Zumfut, leading the two to speculate he might be a secret weapon against the recently establishedAincrad Liberation Squad. Having separated from Argo, Kirito trekked to the Forest Elf Camp he and Asuna had discovered earlier that day, where the next sequence in the Elf War quest series required them to steal a set of orders. However, the swordsman was reluctant to accomplish that goal by leading a midnight assault on the camp and killing the Forest Elves in their sleep like he had in the beta; instead, he opted to infiltrate the camp from the rear by climbing a set of cliffs, which he could only achieve by himself. As the boy approached the cliff just before 01:00, though, he sensed someone hiding and watching him nearby, revealed to be Morte. As the way hisSearchingskill detected the coif-wearing player indicated he had been waiting for him and his partner for a while, Kirito was suspicious of Morte's presence. This wariness only grew when he was requested to postpone the quest for the night for an undisclosed reason, with the implicit threat Morte would alert the Forest Elves to his presence and potentially have him killed if he continued with the infiltration. When the swordsman questioned why he should accept, the other player suggested they settle the matter with a duel. Concerned at the lengths Morte was apparently willing to go just for the chance to hinder him in one quest out of a lengthy questline, the boy agreed to the proposal with the caveat that in the event he won, the other player would explain why he was doing this. Once both swordsmen had moved to a clearing a short distance nearby, Kirito accepted Morte's duel request and drew his Anneal Blade into a neutral battle stance. To his surprise, the coif-wearing player, who only unsheathed his own Anneal Blade with just a few seconds remaining on the countdown timer, charged toward him with a Sword Skill, perfectly timing the attack so as to make the first strike without triggering the criminal code. Though initially panicked, the boy regained his composure after blocking the blow and exchanging attacks with his opponent, even landing the first damaging strike of the duel. Then he attempted to exploit a perceived opening in Morte's defense but was caught off-guard when it was revealed the coif-wearing player had switched his Anneal Blade for a Harsh Hatchet and shield via the Quick Change mod before inflicting two stunning attacks that reduced Kirito's HP to just above half. While contemplating how he was outclassed by his opponent in terms of dueling, the boy realized with how the mechanics of duels operated, Morte was attempting to kill him without becoming an orange player. At the same time, Kirito recognized from the coif-wearing player's handling of his weapon that he was the same axman who had accompanied Kibaou's party in the Queen Spider's Cave days earlier, yet joined Lind's party for the Jade Key quest only hours later. This revelation renewed his resolve to win the duel and discover Morte's motivations, despite his concerns for his life. Carefully timing and aiming his next move, Kirito managed to disarm Morte of his shield with a Martial Arts skill, which exposed his opponent to several attacks that depleted his HP to just about half as well. Before either fighter could continue their battle, however, the coif-wearing player suddenly announced he had run out of time and took his leave, declaring the swordsman was free to resume the infiltration quest since the duel was a draw but cryptically warned it might be difficult. Once Kirito had confirmed Morte was gone, he returned to the cliffs below the Forest Elf Camp. As he drew closer, though, he was startled by a loud shout, which the boy identified as coming from two groups of players that had gathered at the entrance of a path leading to the camp. Having stealthily approached the players under the cover of the forest, Kirito recognized them as members from the ALS and DKB, respectively playing the Elf War campaign on the side of the Forest Elves and Dark Elves, with Kibaou and Lind personally leading the groups. While eavesdropping on the confrontation, he became shocked at Kibaou's claim that completing the Elf War questline provided critical information in defeating the 3rdFloor Boss and accusation that the DKB had deliberately withheld their awareness of such knowledge during the strategy meeting. Deducing Morte must have manipulated events to set the guilds into conflict with each other like this, the boy elected to resolve the situation before the current tensions between them escalated to the point of potential player killing. Inspired by something he overheard from Lind, Kirito quickly backtracked through the forest to the river spot below the Forest Elf Camp. From there, he climbed the cliff, sneaked past the guard patrols into the captain's tent, seized the orders, and retraced his steps back to the river. Once the quest log updated and the camp teleported to a new, randomized location, the boy reascended the cliffs and followed the path to where the ALS and DKB had frozen in shock over the disappearance of their destination, announcing what he had just done. Frustrated when the guilds attempted to resume their argument regardless, Kirito regained their attention by declaring he would be postponing his progress in the Elf War campaign to focus on clearing the Labyrinth, even organizing the boss raid if necessary should they insist on quarreling over the quest series. However, Lind questioned if he was only distracting them while Asuna worked to complete the quest. Unable to refute the Dragon Knights leader's speculation, the boy could only remain silent as the other players threw accusations at him, growing uneasily aware of the situation's similarities with Nezha's public condemnation after the 2ndFloor Boss fight. To everyone's surprise, Asuna suddenly revealed herself from Kirito's original eavesdropping spot in the forest and declared she would assist her partner with his plan. This was shortly followed by Kizmel unveiling her presence and pledging her support in helping the pair clear the Labyrinth, the Dark Elf's high level convincing the other players they were capable of such a feat. After some discussion between the ALS and DKB, Kirito's party was requested to investigate if the Elf War campaign indeed held relevant information on the Floor Boss while the guilds worked on mapping the Labyrinth. Recognizing it as the best option available, the swordsman agreed, whereupon the groups separated to focus on their assigned tasks. Kirito, Asuna and Kizmel spent the next day and a half finishing the remaining quests in the Elf War campaign, pausing only to rest at the Dark Elf Base. This soon culminated in the Dark Elf transporting the Jade Key to the next Floor via a special spirit tree, with the players solemnly bidding their comrade farewell. Then Kirito and Asuna returned to the Dark Elf Base to receive their rewards, after which the commander advised them to carry plenty of antidote potions to counteract the Floor Boss's poisonous attack if they intended to fight it. The boy relayed this warning to the Clearers' second strategy meeting in Zumfut at 17:00 on December 20, clarifying that the boss did not have such an attack in the beta test. Thus, everyone in the boss raid collected as many potions they could find before launching their assault on the Labyrinth the next day, where the swordsman defeated Nerius the Evil Treant at 13:12. As Kirito and Asuna ascended the spiral staircase to the4thFloorwhile the ALS and the DKB remained behind to determine the distribution of boss rewards, they resumed the conversation they had on the 2nd-3rdFloor staircase regarding how combat in Sword Art Online was compared to a concerto. This led to them contemplating on the help they had received throughout the Floor from Kizmel, who the boy assured his partner they would see again. Upon reaching the doors to the 4thFloor at 13:32, Kirito paused for several seconds when he noticed that the carved relief on the doors was different from the beta test version, likely indicating a modification to the floor's terrain. The swordsman followed Asuna as she pushed the doors open, and found that the crisscrossing web of sandy canyons from the beta had been changed into rivers. Contemplating on the alteration of the landscape, Kirito concluded that the only method of navigating the now water-filled canyons was to swim through them. As swimming was hazardous in Sword Art Online, the boy doubted that players would be left without assistance. At that moment, he noticed a tree with donut-shaped fruit standing behind the staircase pavilion and rushed towards it with Asuna. Upon managing to acquire two of the fruits by accidentally striking the tree withSenda, Kirito determined how to inflate them into inner tubes. Now having a means to traverse the floor, he left a scroll next to the pavilion for the other boss raid members, describing the procedure to obtain an inner tube. After advising Asuna to remove her heavy equipment for easier maneuverability, Kirito stripped to his underwear himself, before testing how well the inner tubes would support their weight. Once the pair was satisfied that they would be able to float adequately, the two swam further into the river, holding onto each other's inner tubes and allowing the current to carry them downstream when they reached the middle. Upon reaching land and reequiping their gear, the duo arrived at the northern gate of the main town ofRoviajust before 14:00. As the streets had been converted into channels, the boy decided to hire an NPC-ownedgondolato transport them to the Teleport Gate plaza, learning from the gondolier along the way that the gondola services would only operate within the city. After activating the Teleport Gate at around 14:12, the two retired to a small inn at the edge of the plaza, where Kirito sent a quick message to Argo requesting the location of all the quest NPCs in Rovia, before falling asleep. After three hours of sleep, Kirito joined Asuna for an early dinner at the food carts in the plaza. Just as the two were about to start their meal, they were approached by Argo with Kirito's requested information on a map scroll. Upon paying the info broker for her services, Kirito examined the quest NPCs on the map, noticing a quest that had not been present in the beta test. Believing the quest was essential in conquering the 4thFloor, Kirito and Asuna traveled to the northwestern quadrant of Rovia, where they found the NPC quest giverRomoloin a large old building there. As the boy pondered on the required question to initiate the quest due to the NPC's unresponsiveness to the usual ones, his attention was drawn to a half-rusted, long square nail on the floor by Asuna. This allowed him to deduce that the old man was a shipwright, whom they could request to build a gondola, thus beginning theShipwright of Yorequest. For the first part of the quest, Kirito and Asuna journeyed to the forest southeast of Rovia to gather bear fat. Due to the girl's insistence on collecting only the highest quality versions of the quest materials, the pair trekked through the woods for three hours in search of thebear kingrumored to live in the area. Immediately after they found claw markings that demarcated the bear king's territory, Kirito and Asuna were assaulted by the bear. While evading the bear's attacks, the duo discovered that they could collect Noblewood Cores by manipulating the bear into ramming trees. Deducing that the wood would be required for the next part of the quest, the two continued guiding the bear into ramming trees until they filled their free storage capacity with wood. At that point, the pair switched to active close combat and eventually defeated the bear, whereupon they returned to Rovia. Having arrived at Romolo's home at 23:50, Kirito and Asuna delivered the bear fat and the other crafting ingredients to the NPC and configured the design of their gondola, which they decided to name The Tilnel after Kizmel's sister. Once the gondola was completed at 04:30, the boy navigated The Tilnel into Rovia's waterways to practice steering it, where they encountered several surprisingly abrasive NPC gondoliers. Upon checking his quest log, Kirito discovered the Shipwright of Yore quest prompting them to speak with Romolo, who instructed them to covertly follow a large ship carrying wooden boxes when it departed Rovia around nightfall. Exhausted from their activities, the two agreed to rest and inform Argo of their progress on the quest before proceeding any further. After resupplying and eating lunch about ten hours later, Kirito and Asuna circumnavigated Rovia's southeastern quarter in search of the boat from Romolo's description. Once they identified the ship around 16:30, the duo stealthily followed it out of the city into a submerged dungeon, where they saw the crew handing the boxes to Fallen Elves. Though exhausted from attempting to relocate the vessel when they had lost track of it earlier while navigating the dungeon, Kirito and Asuna decided to continue the quest by investigating the boxes. Having managed to evade the guards while sneaking through the Fallen Elves' hideout, they discovered where the boxes had been stored but to their surprise found them empty. However, after eavesdropping on a conversation between the Fallen Elven General N'ltzahh and his subordinates, the boy deduced the boxes were actually meant to be dismantled into ship construction materials for an unknown scheme that would commence in five days hence. Deciding they had learned enough, the pair departed the dungeon, returning to Rovia by 03:00 for sleep. Having rested from their night adventure, Kirito and Asuna relayed the Shipwright of Yore quest details to Argo, who published the information not connected to the Fallen Elves in her strategy guide that afternoon. While the Clearing guilds used the guide to construct enough gondolas of their own, the two finished quests and scouted the attack patterns ofBiceps Archelon, the Field Boss guarding the caldera that granted access to the southern half of the 4thFloor. As soon as the raid party was ready, they began their battle against Biceps Archelon at 15:00 the next day on December 24. Once the swordsman landed the final blow to defeat the Field Boss, he navigated The Tilnel to the nearby village of Usco to celebrate their victory, being joined by Argo along the way. While the trio briefly rested in Usco, Kirito was shocked to learn from the girls that the ALS and DKB had returned to Rovia for a Christmas party at 17:00, to which the guilds had purposely neglected to invite him. Shortly after Argo left to gather information on the village, it began snowing, prompting the boy to remember how Asuna had wished to see such an event on Christmas back on the 2ndFloor. Although his partner feigned disinterest in celebrating the holiday, he decided to invigorate her spirits by holding their own private Christmas party at a special place where they could view the snowfall better. Once the pair finished resupplying, Kirito steered The Tilnel further downriver, arriving an hour later at the Dark Elven stronghold ofYofel Castle. Having gained entry to the fortress, the boy guided Asuna to the central courtyard, where they reunited with Kizmel. After a sumptuous dinner together, the three relaxed in Yofel Castle's bathing, during which the players learned the base's defenders had grown complacent due to the stronghold's position in the middle of a large lake. Kizmel's explanation of how the Forest Elves consistently lacked enough ships to launch an effective naval assault prompted Kirito to remember what he and his partner had discovered during the Shipwright of Yore quest, which caused him to realize the Fallen Elves were providing the Forest Elves enough ships to attack Yofel Castle in three days. Having reminded Asuna of this, they informed the Dark Elf of what they had found in the Fallen Elves' hideout, whereupon the trio hurried to notify ViscountLeyshren Zed Yofilis, the reclusive master of the fortress, of this new development. After the three reported the Forest Elves' impending assault on Yofel Castle to Yofilis, they were assigned to retrieve the Lapis Key to send it and the Jade Key to a higher floor while the fortress prepared for the siege. Therefore, Kazuto, Asuna, and Kizmel spent the next two days completing quests that eventually allowed them to enter the dungeon holding the key and return to the castle by sunset. At noon on December 27, the trio joined the rest of Yofel Castle's navy in facing the Forest Elven fleet when the latter appeared. Despite managing to sink several enemy ships from aboard The Tilnel, they failed to prevent the Forest Elven flagship from breaching the naval defenses and landing at the fortress dock. Sensing they could still claim victory with Yofilis's help, Kirito decided to beseech the viscount for aid while Asuna and Kizmel assisted the castle gatekeepers in keeping the invaders at bay. Having reached Yofilis's office, he reported the dire state of the battle and implored him to personally take command of his soldiers. When the viscount questioned why he supported the Dark Elves over the Forest Elves, the boy honestly answered he and Asuna simply wanted to protect Kizmel and her people, which convinced Yofilis to join the fight. With the viscount's presence boosting the morale of Yofel Castle's defenders and granting them buffs, the swordsman was able to help repel the invaders, even defeating the Forest Elven inferior knight leading the assault at the cost of shattering his Anneal Blade. In the aftermath of their victory, Kirito was given a selection of rewards for completing the Laketop Fortress quest of the Elf War campaign. In the middle of mulling over which reward to choose, he learned from Asuna that the Clearers had discovered the Floor Boss chamber that morning and already opted to launch their boss raid that same day. When the players notified Kizmel and Yofilis of this, they were informed to their dismay the Floor Boss had changed from a hippogriff in the beta test to a hippocampus with the ability to flood the boss chamber. Concerned at the possibility of the raid party drowning but unable to warn them in time via messaging, the pair elected to hurry to the boss room and see if they could drain the flood from the outside. Having replaced his broken weapon with an Elven Stout Sword dropped by the Forest Elf commander, the swordsman and his partner were accompanied by the Dark Elf knight and the viscount on their hasty rush along the river and into the Labyrinth, being joined by Argo at the dungeon's entrance. To their relief when they reached the boss chamber and opened the doors, they found the raid party had suffered no fatalities. After a brief rousing speech from Yofilis, everyone resumed the fight against Wythege the Hippocampus, with Kirito dealing the final blow at 14:32. While the other Clearers remained in the boss room to negotiate the distribution of the items dropped by the boss, Kirito and Asuna ascended the stairs to the5thFloorto activate the Teleport Gate, all the while discussing their latest experience with the Dark Elves. As they drew closer to the doors leading to the next Floor, the boy was asked by his companion how much longer he intended to continue their partnership, to which the swordsman replied he would work with the fencer until she was strong enough to no longer need him. After reaching the 5thFloor and recounting the rampantplayer killing on the Floor in the beta, Kirito and Asuna arrived atKarluinto activate the town's Teleport Gate and spent the night at an inn. The next day on December 28, the pair committed most of the day to fulfilling quests. As dusk fell, Kirito was requested by Asuna to teach her the basics of player versus player combat, thus the two initiated a first-strike duel. However, Kirito had to halt the duel just as he began his first attack, as Asuna refused to continue with it. Having returned to Karluin after 19:00 that evening, Kirito led Asuna through the southern part of the town to the BLINK & BRINK inn, where he ordered a limited-supply Blue-Blueberry Tart dish as part of their dinner. When the girl drew his attention to an icon that appeared within her view after they consumed the dessert, the boy explained that the dish gave an hour-long buff that highlighted relics littered throughout the town. After spending the next hour on an impromptu relic hunt, the duo teleported to Rovia at around 21:30, where they borrowed a gondola from Agil to travel to Yofel Castle in order to claim their rewards from Viscount Yofilis. After spending the night in the castle, Kirito and Asuna returned to Karluin at 08:20 the next morning on December 29 to continue completing quests. Having finished all the available quests in town by evening, they decided to eat dinner, during which Kirito realized that Argo's strategy guide to the 5thFloor was unusually late. Concerned that the info broker might be in a dungeon, as she could not be reached by friend message, the boy left the BLINK & BRINK after 21:00 to search for her in the catacombs beneath the city. While hurrying through the second level of the catacombs, however, Kirito noticed Asuna's HP bar drop by ten percent. Realizing the girl had followed after him into the dungeon but fallen afoul of a trapdoor, the boy headed to where the trap let out on the third level. Along the way, he found Morte meeting with another player in a secluded room, the latter of whom to his horror was holding Asuna's Chivalric Rapier. Overwhelmed at the thought that the two men might have killed his partner, the swordsman revealed himself to confront them on how they had acquired the weapon. As he and Morte tensely glared at each other, however, his fear for Asuna's safety proved unfounded when the girl revealed herself by startling Morte's confederate into dropping the Chivalric Rapier, allowing the fencer to retrieve it. Though relieved to see his partner was alright, Kirito overheard a large group of monsters attracted by Asuna's entrance approaching their location, thus he grabbed Asuna to conceal both of them with his Hiding skill while Morte and his associate were forced to flee. Even long after the monsters moved past their position, the boy remained in place to gently comfort the girl, who was still frightened by her ordeal. Once Asuna had recomposed herself, Kirito resumed his search for Argo with his partner in tow. Less than an hour later, they found the information broker investigating the area boss guarding the shortcut tunnel that led to the next town of Mananarena. Thanks to Argo solving a puzzle that weakened the resilient boss, the two were able to defeat it alongside the other Clearers on December 30. Afterward, they spent some time working on the Elf War campaign, quickly finishing its chapter on the 5thFloor before the next morning. During this time, Kirito and Asuna invited Argo to join them in the Dark Elven village of Shiyaya as thanks for the information broker's assistance in vanquishing the catacombs boss and to discuss what the fencer had overheard from Morte and his partner. Apparently, while the Dragon Knights Brigade would be occupied with preparing a New Year's party in Karluin, the Aincrad Liberation Squad had been manipulated by Morte and other PK-agitating players into secretly challenging the Floor Boss at the same time, which could sow discord between the two guilds. After Asuna finished relaxing with Argo in Shiyaya's baths, Kirito debated with his partner how to counteract the PK gang's scheme without disrupting the celebration. Hoping to gather more information, the pair decided to contact the Liberation Squad member collaborating with the Dragon Knights on planning the festivities, suspecting the ALS party planner would be opposed to their guild's clandestine boss raid attempt. To that end, Kirito and Asuna traveled to where the DKB was currently stationed in the nearby village of Mananarena and persuaded Shivata, who was acting as his guild's representative for the New Year's party, to disclose the identity of his partner from the ALS. When the Liberation Squad member arrived, revealed to the boy's surprise to be a heavily-armored girl namedLitenas well as Shivata's girlfriend, the duo spent the next several minutes learning how she had been recently scouted into the guild. His suspicions having been assuaged during the recounting that Liten was not secretly in league with Morte, Kirito felt comfortable enough to divulge his awareness of the ALS's intention to attempt defeating the Floor Boss on their own, whereupon the ALS member explained the senior members of her guild had made that decision due to acquiring information that the 5thFloor Boss might drop an item which could destroy the balance among the Clearers. While recollecting his participation in the boss fight from the beta test, he recalled there was indeed an item that could give one guild an advantage over others: the Flag of Valor, which buffed every stat of all the wielder's guildmates within range. Having separated from Liten and Shivata, Kirito and Asuna were joined by Argo in a cafe elsewhere in Mananarena, where they updated the information broker on what they had learned. After contemplating the conflict that could arise from the impossibility of Lind and Kibaou jointly managing the guild flag, the boy decided to vanquish the Floor Boss themselves, claiming they could beat it with a smaller raid party so long as it had not changed significantly from the beta. Once he received confirmation there had been no obvious alterations to the boss, he tasked Asuna with persuading Agil, Liten and Shivata to participate and Argo with gathering supplies. Then the swordsman contacted Nezha at Karluin, where he convinced the chakram user to join them as well to provide long-range support. To Kirito's pleasant surprise when he and Nezha assembled with the others outside Mananarena, he found Liten and Shivata had convinced an additional member from the Aincrad Liberation Squad and the Dragon Knights Brigade to join them alongside Agil's guild, thus they had enough people for their impromptu boss raid. At the behest of Hafner of the DKB, the boy explained his reasons for leading this assault, though he omitted the PK gang's machinations. Then once everyone had redistributed their gear and items to maximize their chances of success, they departed for the Labyrinth around 15:00, with Kirito discussing with Asuna along the way what players and roles to assign to each party in the raid group. Under Argo's guidance, the team used a shortcut that bypassed a giant maze surrounding the Labyrinth tower, enabling them to reach the dungeon far faster than if they had taken the normal route. After a quick break atop the maze's outer wall, during which Kirito was silently comforted by Asuna over a intense reflection over his spearheading of the boss raid, the swordsman officially organized the parties' formations before they entered the Labyrinth at 16:15 through a side door. Due to the side entrance also skipping a fifth of the Labyrinth, the boss raid members had an extra two hours to cooperate with each other in traversing the dungeon and handling its monsters, reaching the stairs to the boss chamber after 20:00. Disturbed by the lack of doors that normally marked entry into the boss room like in the previous Labyrinths, Kirito insisted on accompanying Argo in scouting the staircase in case it was a trap. Having climbed the stairs into the conspicuously empty boss chamber, the boy remained at the entrance while the information broker deliberately stepped into a complex circular pattern formed by fine lines on the floor. To his shock, a giant arm rose under the girl, whose hand grabbed her and destroyed part of her equipment. The swordsman desperately unleashed a Sword Skill that forced the hand to release Argo and retract into the floor, before the duo were prompted to dodge attacks from yet another arm and two legs that respectively burst from the floor and ceiling. Deducing they could avoid triggering the limb attacks by not stepping on the lines, Kirito was about to suggest regrouping at the stairs to Argo when the other boss raid members hurried into the boss room and inadvertently activated the trap, leading to two of them being caught by one of the boss's hands. After instructing Asuna to successfully free the ensnared players, the boy ordered everyone to head to where the floor lines were spaced farthest apart close to the wall, before quickly sharing what he had inferred on the boss's attack patterns. Once Fuscus the Vacant Colossus's face appeared on the ceiling and released a roar that inflicted a defense-lowering debuff on them, the swordsman directed everyone to follow his example of purposely summoning the limbs and striking them as they appeared whenever possible. Midway through the depletion of Fuscus's fourth health bar, Kirito noticed the floor and ceiling were closing toward each other, thus he commanded everyone else to briefly withdraw to the stairs so he could ascertain any changes to the boss's attack patterns. To his bewilderment, the Vacant Colossus's face suddenly reformed around the staircase exit and unyieldingly trapped Shivata in its mouth. Additionally, the symbol on its forehead, which served as its weak point and Nezha had repeatedly targeted throughout the battle to disrupt the debuffing attack, had vanished, meaning there was no obvious way to save the DKB tank from being crushed to death. Before the boy could succumb to despair over the raid party's seemingly inevitable demise, though, Liten's bravery in using her own body to shield Shivata galvanized him to organize the others in pinpointing where the sigil had reappeared on the limbs. Relieved when the weak spot was struck and Shivata freed, as well as at the man's resolve to continue fighting, the swordsman resumed leading the assault without any further major incidents. After Fuscus transformed into a humanoid golem following the reduction of its HP to the final bar, Kirito reorganized the other players into their original intended strategy for handling the Floor Boss until he eventually dealt the last attack on the colossus himself by 20:30. While everyone celebrated their victory over the Floor Boss, Kirito realized he had forgotten to plan what to do if the Flag of Valor did drop. Since monster drops appeared directly in a player's inventory without notifying any party members, it would be too easy for whoever received the guild flag to conceal their acquisition. With this concern in mind, he grew tense at all the raid party members' collective claim of not having it. The boy quickly suspected Liten's ALS guildmate Okotan might be withholding the Flag of Valor due to the man's unusual word choice when earlier discussing how the Aincrad Liberation Squad had intended to handle Fuscus, but was still unsure how to proceed without resorting to heavy-handed methods. However, after drawing strength from Asuna's presence, Kirito looked directly at Okotan and implored with a bow that the guild flag be used for the sake of everyone trapped in SAO. To his relief, the ALS member confessed to possessing the item and having kept quiet about it out of a well-intentioned impulse to see the ALS and DKB merged. At 03:00 on January 1, 2023, Kirito and Asuna teleported to Stachion, where the former drew the latter's attention to the puzzles that comprised much of the town. As the duo wandered through the city, the boy recalled how he had been ambushed by a man in a black poncho in Karluin only a few hours earlier. Predicting that another attempt would be made on his and Asuna's lives, he resolved to teach his partner how to protect herself against such inevitable encounters. With that thought in mind, Kirito informed the girl of the incident, requesting to resume their player versus player combat practices in the morning before proceeding any further with clearing the6thFloor, to which she agreed. After breakfast that same morning, Kirito and Asuna traveled to the Dark Elf Base on the 3rdFloor to upgrade their weapons and armor, as well as privately practice player versus player combat. After upgrading the Sword of Eventide's Accuracy and Durability and spending an hour training in player versus player combat, the pair returned to Stachion at 12:30 to meet with Lind, Hafner, and Shivata to inform the Dragon Knights Brigade on the Flag of Valor, which resulted in the two parties coming to an agreement that Kirito would continue maintaining custody of the item. After the meeting, Kirito and Asuna began working on quests in-town, including the Curse of Stachion quest series. As part of the questline, the two journeyed to Suribus by nightfall to investigate a mansion owned by Pithagrus, the previous lord of Stachion. Having obtained a key needed for the quest from the haunted building after 21:00, Kirito decided to surprise Asuna by not warning her about an upcoming scripted event, allowing themselves to be ambushed on their way out of the house by Cylon, an apprentice of Pithagrus who had hired them to investigate his former master. Immobilized with a paralyzing gas, the duo was abducted by Cylon and his henchman to be transported back to Stachion as part of the quest. Shortly after leaving Suribus, however, the carriage carrying the pair was intercepted by Morte and his accomplice. Still paralyzed, the boy could only helplessly watch as Morte disarmed and killed Cylon so as to target them next more easily, resulting in a bonanza of the NPC's valuables falling to the ground upon his death. Among the pile of loot, Kirito noticed a small skull-marked jar: the Namnepenth's Poison Jar Cylon had used to incapacitate them in town earlier. As Morte approached them, Kirito and Asuna independently arrived at the same plan of action: to topple the jar by blowing on it. With their combined effort, the two managed to spawn a cloud of paralyzing smoke that forced their would-be murderer to retreat. As soon as he was freed from his paralysis debuff, the boy retrieved his sword and pursued Morte out of the toxic fumes, only to find himself outnumbered as Asuna seemingly failed to escape the gas cloud. As he engaged the two men, however, his fears for his partner's safety proved to be misguided when he noticed the girl sneakily leaving the fumes with a gas mask to launch a surprise attack on Morte's dagger-wielding associate while the two assailants were preoccupied with him. Now able to focus his attention solely on Morte, Kirito baited the axman into overextending himself during his assault by pretending to trip. As an emboldened Morte took a broad step towards him, the swordsman suddenly closed the distance between them and blocked his opponent's ax by the handle, creating an opening that allowed him to sever the man's left forearm. To both of their surprise, when Morte attempted to block a followup attack, Kirito's Accuracy-boosted Sword of Eventide unexpectedly evaded the weapon at the last second to embed itself in his opponent's heart. Just as the critical hit had reduced Morte's hit points by about seventy-five percent, Kirito was attacked by the man's associate. Though the swordsman managed to deflect the attack, he was too exhausted from the fighting to counterattack or pursue the player killers as they fled from the area. Having returned to Suribus, after breakfast the next morning on January 2, Kirito and Asuna examined the items they had obtained the previous night, which included the golden key from Pithagrus's mansion, an iron one dropped by Cylon, two poisoned throwing picks used by Morte, and his confederate's dagger. During their survey, Kirito explained how they were now unable to complete the Curse of Stachion quest due to the player killers' interference, opening the quest log to illustrate his point. To their surprise, the quest log had updated to reflect Cylon's death and was directing them to locate where to use the keys. Though curious over how they still could continue the quest despite the quest giver being killed, the boy was more interested in the player killers' weapons, whose descriptions indicated they had been received from Fallen Elves. Concerned at the possibility that the player killers might have access to an unlimited supply of high-level poisoned weapons, the two agreed to prioritize investigating the throwing picks further. To that end, they needed to help clear the 6thFloor so they could contact Kizmel again. After Kirito and Asuna joined the Clearers at the front lines later that day, they assisted in clearing the first of the four mountainous dungeons that sequentially blocked access to the rest of the 6thFloor. During their journey, the boy surreptitiously attempted to confirm that Joe of the ALS was Morte's accomplice, but without success. Once they gained access to the northwest sector of the Floor by defeating the first Field Boss, the duo separated from the Clearers to trek to the Dark Elven fortress of Castle Galey at the north end of the Floor, arriving there by twilight. Having reunited with Kizmel inside the castle, Kirito explained the attempt on his and Asuna's lives and showed her the Spines of Shmargor and the Dirk of Agony, Morte's and his accomplice's weapons, which the Dark Elven knight confirmed had likely been gifted by Fallen Elves. To his relief, he learned Kizmel knew of a Dark Elven storyteller in Castle Galey that could possibly inform them how to counteract the Spikes' poison, who they could contact while working on the Elf War campaign. Since the trio could only visit the storyteller in the early afternoon, they decided to focus on retrieving the Agate Key after breakfast the next morning on January 3. With the aid of special Dark Elven equipment, Kirito, Asuna, and Kizmel were able to enter the south sector of the 6thFloor by crossing Lake Talpha in the Floor's center without disturbing the starfish monster Ophiometus inhabiting it, thereby bypassing the need to trek through the mountainous dungeons. Having reached the key shrine, the humans were surprised to find the dungeon entrance locked with a thirty-five puzzle, when such puzzles were were supposed to be restricted to Stachion, though the Dark Elf was able to quickly solve it. Once the three had managed to secure the Agate Key, they returned to Castle Galey by 16:20 but were too late to meet with the storyteller. That evening, just as Kirito and Asuna were about to explore Castle Galey after dinner, they heard the arrival of other players entering the fortress. Concerned it might be Morte or members of the PK gang, they decided to investigate. To their surprised relief, the visitors were revealed to be a small guild named Qusack, who focused on obtaining money and strengthening themselves purely by completing quests. While learning the history behind Qusack's formation, the pair were interested to discover that instead of another variant of Kizmel, the guild was accompanied by a generic Dark Elf Scout, who would only appear while they worked on the Dark Elf side of the Elf War campaign. Silently disquieted by the implications of Qusack's presence at Castle Galey, Kirito and Asuna reunited with Kizmel in their quarters, where the former accidentally let slip the guild's intent to collect the Agate Key themselves. To the two's astonishment, the Dark Elf explained her people had taken several measures involving decoys and fake keys to prevent the real ones from being stolen, in such a way that allowed multiple players to undertake the Elf War questline separately yet simultaneously; in addition, the fortress's location discouraged the Forest Elves and the Fallen Elves from attacking it the way they did with Yofel Castle. These words somewhat reassured the boy and the girl that their time with Kizmel was unlikely to be disrupted by unforeseen circumstances, which relaxed them enough to invite their Dark Elf companion to sleep with them in their room for the night, However, Kirito still had suspicions that the Forest Elves could launch an invasion on Castle Galey from atop the cliffs into which the fortress had been built, a misgiving exacerbated by Morte's attempted assassination. Therefore, he woke at 02:00 that morning without disturbing his companions and snuck onto the roof of the castle to assess the likelihood of such a scenario. Having climbed the cliff via a combination of jumping and wall-running from the castle roof, the boy spent the next hour surveying the terrain to find if there were any other avenues of reaching the top aside from the one he used. Toward the end of his search, Kirito encountered a staircase cut into the middle of the flat mountaintop from which the scent of cooking meat wafted. Tempted by the smell, he descended the stairs to find an Dark Elven NPC, named Bouhroum, frying something resembling a hamburg steak. While attempting the elf to let him share some of the meat with him, the swordsman eventually recognized Bouhroum as a modified version of the NPC who offered training in the Meditation skill during the beta test. Following this revelation, Kirito was offered the choice to either partake in the fricatelle or undertake a quest to acquire Meditation. After a minute of indecision, the boy decided to accept the latter option, whereupon he was tasked to keep his thoughts focused and tranquil for the next three hours. Despite a few false starts, the swordsman was able to successfully spend the allotted time concentrating on his time with Asuna and consequently received the Meditation skill, which automatically gained 500 proficiency alongside the Awakening mod the moment he equipped it. Once Kirito resumed and completed his original mission of confirming it would impossible for the Forest Elves to attack Castle Galey from the mountain, he returned to an awakened and displeased Asuna and Kizmel, to whom he explained his actions but omitted his meeting with Bouhroum. When the three were joined by Qusack during breakfast afterward, Kirito, still possessed by the suspicion the guild could be connected to or manipulated by Morte's PK gang, inquired the quartet on why they had chosen to arrive at the frontlines regardless of the sparsity of information thereof. To the swordsman's surprise, he learned Qusack's progress on the Curse of Stachion quest had stalled following Cylon's disappearance, which coincided with Morte's ambush. After Qusack departed to work on the Elf War campaign, Kirito, still astounded to learn the ramifications of Cylon's death were not limited to him and Asuna contrary to his expectations, explained to a curious Kizmel their progress on the Curse of Stachion quest. Furthering his bewilderment, the Dark Elf then insisted on immediately accompanying them to Stachion to investigate the two keys the players had obtained. Although concerned about bringing an elven NPC into a human town, the boy agreed to the request. Having arrived in Stachion before 10:00, the trio were in the middle of finding a place to briefly rest when they detected someone shadowing them. The observer was revealed to be a little girl named Myia, who led them to an abandoned house to identify herself as the daughter of Cylon and Pithagrus's former maidservant Theano. Remembering how Theano was supposed to assist players in the Curse of Stachion quest had everything proceeded as normal, Kirito inquired Myia on the whereabouts of her mother in hopes of discovering how to advance the now disrupted questline. In response, he and the others learned Theano had vanished the morning after Cylon's death, leaving behind a note apologizing for her disappearance and a duplicate of the iron key dropped by the deceased lord; the following night, a thief attempted to steal the key, forcing the little girl to take shelter in their current location. At that moment, however, the group was suddenly ambushed by two black-masked figures, who threw a bomb that released a mysterious gas. With help from Asuna and Myia, Kirito and Kizmel managed to repel the assailants without inhaling the smoke, forcing the would-be burglars to retreat. To the swordsman's shock, the Dark Elf recognized their attackers by their blades and the Spines of Shmargor they had thrown during their escape as Fallen Elf assassins, followed by Myia identifying them as having the exact same clothing as the robber she had fought. Realizing the thieves must have been targeting her, Kirito inquired the little girl on the keys they had found, to which they learned the iron keys were constantly drawn to each other, hence how she had had been able to find them. Theorizing Theano might have been searching for the golden key, everyone figured they could locate her at the place where it would be needed: in the Dungeon of Trials beneath Cylon's mansion, where the late lord would have normally taken the players as part of the Curse of Stachion quest. To the quartet's disappointment, they did not find Theano under the mansion, or the golden cube needed to complete the quest. With no other alternative, Kirito and Asuna agreed to Kizmel's suggestion that they return to Castle Galey to safely discuss what to do next. Kirito trying to reach Sachi. One day, when Kirito was walking in the labyrinth area of a lower floor, he met Sachi and the others in the Moonlit Black Cats guild. After rescuing them from the labyrinth, he hid his higher level from them and was invited into the guild. He helped them reach higher levels, taught Sachi how to fight and, had fun with them. One day, Sachi ran away from the group and Kirito used his Tracking skill to find her. He talked with her and made her forget her fear of dying, while she helped him clear his conscience of lying to the other members of the guild. One day, the group decided to hunt for treasure while their leader,Keita, was off to buy their guild base. In a Labyrinth on a higher floor, they activated a trap, causing a multitude ofDark Dwarf MinersandGranite Elementalsto spawn. The members, unable to use teleport crystals due to the room being anAnti-Crystal Area, were all killed one by one, except for Kirito. He returned to their temporary headquarters inTaftto inform Keita, who committed suicide out of shock at the loss of his friends and the reveal that their newest member was a Beater. With the approach of Christmas Eve, all of the NPCs started talking about a mysterious monster which would appear on Christmas and drop rare items if defeated, causing players to look for clues regarding its future location. However, nobody could find a good lead, as the NPCs said that it would spawn at ""a certain fir tree"". Originally, Kirito and Klein had not cared about the boss until they learned that it would drop a resurrection item. When Kirito found the spawn location of the boss within theForest of Wandering, Klein and his guildFuurinkazanfollowed him there so that they could fight the boss. Moments later, theDivine Dragon Alliance, who had followed Klein and his guild, showed up. Klein told Kirito that the alliance would do anything to obtain any rare items and then told Kirito to defeat the boss while they distracted the DDA. Kirito then arrived at the correct tree, and when the bell announced midnight, the event boss,Nicholas The Renegade, spawned and was about to begin its speech, but Kirito attacked it without listening to him. After a long struggle and barely surviving, Kirito defeated the boss and obtained theDivine Stone of Returning Soul. But, to his disappointment, the item only revived players up to ten seconds after they had died. After several minutes of mourning, Kirito then gave the item to Klein and slowly walked back to his inn. He stayed up until early morning, planning to die trying to solo the floor boss once dawn broke. However, at seven o'clock, when he was about to leave, he heard a strange alarm ring in his ear and noticed an item left in his shared inventory with Sachi. Once he took out the item, a recording crystal, he heard a message left to him by Sachi before her death, urging Kirito to survive. Upon encountering Silica in the Forest of Wandering, Kirito saved her from a party of attacking «Drunk Apes». He apologized for being unable to save Pina, Silica'sTamed Monster, and told her that it was possible to revive Pina. After explaining the item needed, and that she needed to come with him, Kirito gave her new equipment to supplement the level needed to clear the quest. After having dinner with her and showing her the location of thePneuma Flower, they slept and departed to the floor the next day. Kirito revealed that he was helping Silica because she reminded him of his sister. Kirito stopping the leader of the orange Guild, Titan's Hand. The next day, they departed to the47thFloorto find the Pneuma Flower on theHill of Memories. On their way back after retrieving the flower, they were ambushed byRosaliaand theTitan's Handguild. They attacked Kirito but were forced to surrender due to his higher level. Kirito revealed that he was looking for them because of a request from a leader ofanother guild, whose members were all killed, with the exception of the leader, by the Titan's Hand guild. Kirito then threatened the bandits until they agreed to voluntarily go to the prison managed by theAincrad Liberation Force. After returning toFloria, Kirito and Silica promised to meet again in the real world. Around the end of February 2024, Kirito and the other Clearers spent a week attempting to determine a way to circumvent theGeoCrawler, the Field Boss of the 56thFloor blocking the path to the local Labyrinth, as frontal attacks against it were ineffective, while its position prevented flanking the monster. On March 6, 2024, after another failed attempt to bait the GeoCrawler, Kirito entered a quarrel with Asuna due to the latter proposing to lure the boss into the village and allow it to slaughter the villagers to give them an opportunity to attack the monster while it was occupied. Kirito protested against her suggestion, arguing that the NPCs were not mere objects. When Asuna learnt from Klein that Kirito was one level higher than her, the boy accepted her challenge to a first-strike duel to vindicate his belief, recognizing some traits of his personality from his darker times in her eyes. Although he was initially forced on the defensive by her speed and usage of short-delay-time Sword Skills, the Black Swordsman was able to trick the Flash into leaving herself open by feinting the use of a second sword, granting him the opportunity to defeat her. The next day on March 7, during the celebration of the successful vanquishment of the GeoCrawler using an alternate method, Kirito excitedly liftedRuru, the NPC girl who had been integral to beating the Field Boss, into the air. However, the boy received a system warning for harassing an NPC the next moment. Kirito saving Yolko, Caynz, and Schmitt from the Laughing Coffin. On April 22, 2024, noticing the unusually favorable weather settings that morning, Kirito elected to take a quick nap in the fields right outside the Teleport Gate plaza of themain cityof the 59thFloor. During his nap, the boy was found by Asuna, from whom he received an admonishment for not actively assisting the other players in clearing the Labyrinth. Despite offering her to rest beside him, Kirito did not actually expect to find the girl sleeping next to him when he awoke thirty minutes later. Sensing her exhaustion, the swordsman decided to let her sleep, guarding her from player killers. When Asuna finally awoke over eight hours later, the boy was offered a free meal as compensation for his consideration. Shortly after they began eating a salad at a restaurant inMartenon the 57thFloor, the duo suddenly heard a horrified scream from outside, prompting them to rush to the source. In the town square, they found anarmored playerhanging by his neck from a noose from a church's second floor window, with abarbed short spearimpaled into his chest, who seemingly died before anyone could help him. Convinced that the player had been killed in a duel, Kirito and Asuna quickly searched for a duel winner notice, but to no avail. Aware that the existence of a method to kill players within a safe zone would lead to panic, the two agreed to investigate the matter together. After retrieving the spear and the rope from within the church, Kirito and Asuna returned outside to the plaza, where they found that a young woman namedYolkowas the first person to witness the incident. Gently questioning her, they learned that the victim, named Kains, was one of her former guildmates who had had dinner with her just before his murder. Having escorted Yolko to the nearest inn, the pair had other players spread news of the incident, while they themselves investigated the rope and spear for any further leads on the killer. Since neither of them possessed an Appraisal skill and Asuna's blacksmith friend would be occupied with business at the time, Kirito proposed to contact Agil for assistance. Having sent a message to Agil beforehand, Kirito traveled with Asuna tohis shopinAlgadeon the 50thFloor, where they had the shopkeeper examine the rope and spear with his Appraisal skill. The duo learned that the spear, named Guilty Thorn, had been crafted byGrimlock, a player unknown to Agil. Although apprehensive of locating someone willing to create a weapon designed for player killing, Kirito and Asuna resolved to search for anyone on the middle floors who had been acquainted with Grimlock. After teleporting to the Town of Beginnings, Kirito, Asuna, and Agil investigated theMonument of Lifeat theBlack Iron Palace, where they verified that Grimlock was still alive, while a player named Kains had indeed died that day at 18:27. Having decided with Asuna to resume their search for Grimlock the following day, Kirito returned toLindarthpast 22:00 to spend the night at his current residence. However, he was immediately surrounded by several members of the Divine Dragon Alliance, led bySchmitt, upon his arrival. After being interrogated by Schmitt about Kains's death, he acquiesced to surrendering the murder weapon to him. Upon meeting with Yolko at 10:00 the following morning, Kirito and Asuna learned from her that Grimlock, Schmitt, and Yolko herself had once been part of theGolden Apple, a guild that had acquired a rareagility-boosting ringabout half a year prior, yet subsequently collapsed when their guild leaderGriseldawas murdered for the ring shortly afterwards. Believing whoever killed Kains was connected to Griselda's death, the two secured Yolko's stay at her inn for several days to keep her safe. Afterwards, Kirito suggested consulting withHeathclifffor advice on how to proceed with the investigation, due to his knowledge of Sword Art Online's mechanics. Once Heathcliff joined them thirty minutes later, Kirito led him and Asuna toa restaurantdeep within the mazelike city. While they waited for their lunch, the boy proposed several theories on how the Inner Area murder could have happened, all of which were debunked. After the meal, Kirito asked his partner for clarification on the guild leader's lengthy recommendation not to rely on secondhand sources of information, to which he learned they should question the motives behind Golden Apple's dissolution over the rare ring. Therefore, he agreed to the girl's suggestion to inquire Schmitt for his part of the story on the incident in hopes of acquiring new information. Having deduced Schmitt would seek the most secure location in which to hide, Kirito and Asuna journeyed to the Divine Dragon Alliance's headquarters on the 56thFloor shortly after 14:00, where they persuaded the heavily armored lancer to speak with them. While interrogating Schmitt on the whereabouts of Grimlock, Griselda's husband and the main suspect in Kains's murder, the pair learned the blacksmith used to frequent a NPC restaurant; however, the man insisted on meeting with Yolko before he would reveal the establishment's name. Though confused by the nature of the request, they reluctantly accepted it after Yolko agreed via friend message. Once they had escorted Schmitt to Yolko's inn by sundown, Kirito and Asuna kept guard as the former Golden Apple members speculated who could have killed Kains and why. In the middle of the discussion, however, a black, barbed throwing dagger suddenly appeared in Yolko's back which had been facing her room's window. The boy rushed to the young woman's side, but her avatar fell through the window to disintegrate on the street below before he could reach her. Frozen in horrified disbelief, Kirito spotted a black robed, hooded figure watching them from the rooftop of a building two blocks away. Outraged over his failure to protect Yolko, he leapt from the window to the next building and recklessly jumped from roof to roof toward the assassin, who suddenly withdrew a teleport crystal as the boy approached. In an desperate attempt to delay the murderer's escape, Kirito hurled three Throwing Picks at the figure, but theAnti-Criminal Code Effect Areaprotected the assassin from the projectiles. Additionally, the 17:00 bells began tolling just as the hooded figure activated the crystal, preventing the swordsman from hearing the name of the destination while the killer vanished. Having retrieved the throwing dagger along the way, a frustrated Kirito returned to the inn, where a hysterical Schmitt insisted the murderer had to be Griselda's ghost based on its appearance. Believing otherwise, the boy had the frightened lancer give him the name of Grimlock's frequented restaurant, hoping to dissuade the man from his vendetta if he really was the killer and was motivated by vengeance over his wife's death like Yolko had suggested during the conversation earlier. In addition, Kirito requested a list of all the other former Golden Apple members so he could check which of them were still alive. Afterward, the swordsman and Asuna escorted the agitated Schmitt back to the DDA's headquarters before heading for the restaurant to unravel the mystery for Yolko's sake. Once Kirito and Asuna located the restaurant in a secluded section of the 20thFloor's main city, they rented a room in a nearby inn to observe the players entering and exiting the pub. From there, the boy planned to challenge any potential suspects matching Yolko's killer's height and build to a duel, as it would prompt the system to display his target's name and hopefully reveal Grimlock that way. Following a quick meal at around 18:40 during their stakeout, the duo began discussing methods of handling cases of rare drops in SAO, as the lack of logs tempted players to keep their drops a secret from their party members. To Kirito's surprise, his partner decided that kind of system also made marriage within the game more meaningful, since spouses could not hide things from each other in their shared inventory. Captivated by the thought that the player who had initially received the ring could not have been the killer due to not keeping the ring a secret, Kirito glimpsed through the list of names Schmitt had written. However, just as he was about to return the parchment to his inventory, he noticed the man had spelled Kains's name as Caynz. After a few moments of bewilderment, the boy realized they had misunderstood the incident entirely, proclaiming to Asuna that Caynz and Yolko were still alive. Kirito using Dark Repulser for the first time. Around noon of June 25, 2024, due to Asuna's referral, Kirito visitedLisbeth's Smith Shopand requested Lisbeth to create for him a sword that was on par with his «Elucidator». When the blacksmith offered her best sword, he expressed his dissatisfaction with its light weight and decided to test its durability by striking it against the Elucidator, accidentally shattering the former. Apologizing to an indignant Lisbeth for destroying her masterpiece, Kirito casually agreed to her demand to accompany him in gathering the materials to craft a weapon that would surpass his own blade. Thus, the two traveled to theWest Mountainto obtain a «Crystallite Ingot» to forge what would eventually be known as «Dark Repulser». After two years into SAO, Kirito was currently on the front lines which were now located on the74thFlooron October 17, 2024. As he left the Labyrinth, Kirito found and killed aRagout Rabbit, the meat of which he later gave to Asuna to cook. He was then forced on a mapping run with Asuna. After defeatingKuradeel, Asuna's bodyguard, in a duel, the two departed for the Labyrinth the next day on October 18. Together they found the boss room. While resting at a nearby safe zone, they encountered an elite unit of the «Aincrad Liberation Force» , whom Kirito and Asuna assumed would try to challenge the boss. They chased after them in case the platoon did something unreasonable, but «The Army» platoon started fighting the boss before they could reach them. Kirito told them to teleport out, but one of the soldiers told him that their crystals would not work in the boss room as it was an Anti-Crystal Area. Kirito using Dual Blades. Upon arriving, Asuna impulsively ran in to help them, and Kirito quickly followed her. He was forced to activate his «Dual Blades» secret skill to save Asuna and the others. After the boss fight, word about Kirito's ability spread throughout Aincrad. Asuna asked for a temporary leave of absence from her guild and Heathcliff, the leader, said that he would only allow permission if Kirito defeated him in a duel. If Kirito lost, he would have to join the Knights of the Blood guild. Kirito accepted the challenge and was on the verge of winning, but, at the last moment, Heathcliff moved with impossible speed. The duel ended with Kirito's loss, forcing him to abide by their deal. He was given a KoB outfit, and after a few days, sent to a mandatory training session with Kuradeel on October 23. After the latter killedGodfree, the vanguard who wanted to see Kirito's skills, and revealed his plan to kill him, Asuna quickly came to Kirito's aid. After Kuradeel successfully feigned a surrender, he attacked Asuna after she lowered her rapier, and almost killed her. Kirito quickly intercepted, and though he lost his left arm in the process, he killed Kuradeel using the Martial Arts Sword Skill,Embracer. After this, Kirito announced his feelings for Asuna, and the two asked for another leave after the incident, which Heathcliff accepted. After proposing to Asuna at 21:00 on October 23, 2024, Kirito considered where to live quietly for their honeymoon. Thus, he recalled an isolatedlog houseon the22ndFloorthat he had encountered a year and a half prior, at a time when he had lacked the funds to purchase the estate. Wishing to spend his newlywed life with Asuna there, the boy proposed the option to the girl. The next day past 14:00 on October 24, after sending messages to their friends and settling their request for a temporary withdrawal from the Knights of the Blood, Kirito and Asuna teleported to the 22ndFloor. As they drew close to where Kirito had found the house, the boy hurried after the girl when she enthusiastically rushed ahead, but was surprised to see the home no longer there. Kirito and Asuna's honeymoon. While Asuna and Kirito were on their honeymoon on the 22ndFloor, they heard of a rumor of a ghost in the forest and decided to go check it out on October 30, 2024. In the forest, they found a young girl who went by the name of Yui, who they suspected was a traumatized player who had regressed into a baby. However, they were unable to find aColor Cursoron her, meaning she was not a player, NPC, or monster. Despite this finding, they deduced that it was most likely that she was a player. After taking her to their home and reading the Lost & Found/Q&A section of the newspaper for possible people searching for this mysterious player with no luck, they decided to go to the «Town of Beginnings» to find her parent/guardian, if they were still there. Upon their arrival at the «Town of Beginnings» the next day on October 31, they travelled around town in hope of finding her parents and were eventually led to a nearby church, serving as an orphanage for kids who were trapped in SAO. Even here, there were no signs of Yui's parents. The ""family"" of Kirito, Asuna and Yui. Then on November 1, they went to aHidden Dungeonto saveThinker, the nominal leader of the Aincrad Liberation Force , who was trapped within its deepest levels. Yui watched Kirito easily handle theScavenge Toadsand was amazed by his fighting skills. After reaching the safe area in the dungeon, Kirito toldYulierto take Yui into the safe area. The safe area contained a GM module, and after touching it, Yui suddenly remembered what she was. As the boss,The Fatal Scythe, was about to deal the final blow on Kirito and Asuna, Yui went in front of them. To their shock, the boss's attack on her was deflected due to her «Immortal Object» status, and Yui defeated The Fatal Scythe with the «Object Eraser». The two discovered that Yui was actually a Mental Health Counseling program and that theCardinal Systemwould delete her. When this happened, Kirito used the still active console to save her data into his NerveGear in the form ofYui's Heart. Kirito and Asuna planned to recreate her as Yui once they escaped from SAO. During the second week of their honeymoon on November 6, 2024, Kirito and Asuna received a call: the boss room of the 75thFloor had been found. They returned to the front lines the next day on November 7 and participated in the battle. During the battle, Kirito, Asuna, and Heathcliff managed to hold back the incrediblypowerful bosswhile the rest of the players attacked it. Afterwards, Kirito had an intuitive realization; he first attacked Heathcliff, revealed his ""Immortal Object"" status, and concluded that Heathcliff was none other than Kayaba Akihiko himself. Kayaba lauded Kirito and announced that he would be waiting on the100thFlooras the final boss. A KoB member attacked Heathcliff, prompting him to paralyze everyone in the room. After that, Heathcliff offered Kirito a chance at a one-versus-one duel, declaring that defeating him would clear the game, and the surviving players would be logged out of SAO. Kirito agreed despite Asuna's pleads to fall back. After a few minutes of fighting, Kirito became enraged and used a Sword Skill, and Kayaba, knowing the system all too well, took advantage of the post-motion delay to finish him off. However, Asuna intercepted the blow, despite her paralysis, and died from the attack. Kirito, filled with despair, attacked Kayaba thoughtlessly and was quickly struck down. Kazuto vowing to find Asuna. Through a final push of his will, before his body was deleted by the system, Kirito stabbed Heathcliff in the chest with Asuna'sLambent Light. Heathcliff and Kirito both vanished and were transported up to an area located above Aincrad, along with Asuna. Akihiko explained his reasons as for why he created SAO before vanishing along with his castle. During these final moments, Asuna and Kirito revealed their names: Yuuki Asuna and Kirigaya Kazuto, to each other. Shortly after, Kazuto woke up in a hospital bed, his body frail and weak. He rose from the bed, vowing to find Asuna. After SAO was cleared and Kazuto woke up in a Tokyo hospital, he wandered off to find Asuna, but failed. Soon after, he was visited by Kikuoka Seijirou, a representative of the «SAO Case Victims Rescue Force». Kazuto inquired about Asuna's whereabouts in exchange for sharing information about the SAO incident with him. After knowing Asuna's condition, he later attempted to return to the world of SAO via his NerveGear to find her, but the SAO servers had shut down.[20]"
How did Kazuto feel when he heard about Asuna?,despairing,Fairy dance arc,"Kazuto after finishing his rehabilitation. Two months after SAO was ended, Kazuto returned home to his family and had completed his rehabilitation, which allowed him to move freely again. Thus, he started to visit Asuna on occasion. During one of such visits on January 19, 2025, Asuna's father,Yuuki Shouzou, andSugou Nobuyukicame into the hospital room. After Nobuyuki was introduced, he told Asuna's father that he planned on having Asuna wear her bridal gown the next week. After Asuna's father's departure, he revealed his true nature and started stroking Asuna's hair while stating that he had the right to marry her, as he was in charge of maintaining the servers that hosted her conscience. He invited Kazuto to the wedding, leaving the boy helpless to do anything. Kazuto despairing after hearing about Asuna. That evening, Kazuto's sister Suguha found him alone in his room in a state of deep despair and self-loathing. After telling his sister that Asuna was out of his reach and how useless he felt, he began crying like a child in front of her. After closing the window, Suguha comforted her brother and encouraged him not to give up so easily, and then gently lowered him onto his bed, where awhile later, his cries ceased. Andrew with Kazuto at his cafe. When Kazuto awoke the next morning, January 20, he found Suguha sleeping next to him in her pajamas. He then recalled what had happened the night before and, due to Suguha's encouragement, had renewed his resolve to save Asuna. Shortly after, he received an e-mail from Agil that contained a picture of a virtual world, where a bird cage could be seen in the foreground. In that cage was a girl who looked exactly like Asuna. Kazuto immediately left to meet Andrew Gilbert Mills at theDicey Cafe. There, he was shown a package for a new VRMMO game called ALfheim Online. After learning more about the game, as well as theAmuSphere, the successor of the NerveGear used to play it, Kazuto discovered that the picture he had received earlier was taken inside of the game, at the top of the World Tree. After noticing that the game was designed byRECT Progress Inc.and remembering that Nobuyuki, who worked there, said that he was in charge of the SAO servers, he realized that it could not have been just a coincidence. Thinking to himself that contacting the Ministry of Internal Affairs without concrete evidence was a bad idea, Kazuto asked Andrew to let him have the game client to personally confirm whether Asuna really was trapped in ALO. Kazuto choosing a Spriggan as his avatar. Upon returning home, Kazuto inserted the ALO client into his NerveGear and dove into the game. At the character creation screen, he inserted his character name and then continued to choose his character's race. Due to being pressed for time and not planning to play the game too seriously, he selected the Spriggan race because of its initial black-themed equipment rather than based on the race's strengths and weaknesses. Kirito was then sent into a vortex of light and entered the game world, floating in the air above the Spriggan capital. However, while free falling towards the Spriggan capital, a glitch occurred, and the area below Kirito collapsed into darkness. Kirito noticing his abnormal skill values. After a seemingly endless descent and landing on his face instead of his feet, he found himself in theAncient Forest. Due to some bad feeling, Kirito tried to open the main menu, and finally realized that commands in ALO were controlled with the left hand, instead of the right hand as it was in SAO. While the logout function was available and his HP and MP values were normal for a starting character, his avatar had over 8 skills already learnt, most of which were nearly or fully completed. However, those skills seemed strangely familiar to him, and he realized that all of the skills he had were identical to his SAO skills, except his Dual Blades skill. Kirito finding Yui's heart in his inventory. Hoping to find more clues about what was happening, he checked his item window, only to find dozens of lines consisting of enigmatic numbers and characters. That being said, all the items that he had in SAO, though no longer usable, confirmed that his SAO save data was brought over to ALO for some reason. Realising this, Kirito hoped that one specific item would be among the various unusable items and soon found the item he was looking for: MHCP-001, in other words, Yui's Heart. After he tapped the crystal twice, Yui appeared. Kirito reuniting with his ""daughter"". After Yui checked the system, Kirito learned from her that the ALO server was a copy of the SAO servers, using the same graphics engine, but an older version of the Cardinal System and different game components, and that the game used an almost identical save data and skill proficiency format to the one SAO used, which was why he was able to inherit his skills, with the exception of data denoting HP and MP. She also warned him that his items were corrupted and should be disposed of before the system's error detection protocol detected them. As for his abnormal skill values, Yui told Kirito that he should be fine unless a GM checked them directly. Kirito asked Yui what was she supposed to be in the game, and she took the form of aNavigation Pixie. Later, Kirito learned how toflywith a controller from her. Soon after, they found that some other players were approaching, one being chased by three others. Hearing that, Kirito decided to go take a closer look at it and used his controller to fly to the scene of the battle. Kirito's grand entrance interrupting the battle. Once there, due to not having practiced landing, he crash-landed near the 3Salamandersand aSylph, named Leafa, who the Salamanders were hunting. While Leafa told Kirito to run away as she noticed that he was using starting equipment, he only reproached the Salamanders for ganging up on the girl, angering the Salamanders. Two of them moved in to sandwich him, but Kirito easily stopped the first strike and threw the Salamander into his teammate who was still airborne. After confirming with Leafa that it was alright to kill the Salamanders, Kirito drew his sword, and charged at one of the Salamanders and killed him in one swing. The other Salamander was mercilessly bisected shortly after. Looking up at the leader of the party,Kagemune, Kirito relaxed and asked whether he was going to fight as well, but Kagemune only smiled as he refused. Kirito trying to hide Yui from Leafa. As soon as Kagemune had flown away and theRemain Lightsof the two other Salamanders disappeared, Leafa asked the boy about what he expected her to do now, to which he responded by joking about her hugging him. Before Leafa was able to retaliate, Yui emerged out of Kirito's breast pocket, telling Leafa that she would only let Mama and herself stick to Papa. Kirito reacted by wrapping both of his hands around the Pixie, not knowing how to explain what she was to Leafa, who then asked whether Yui was a Private Pixie, a prize of a lottery that took place at the launch of the game, which Kirito confirmed to cover Yui's true nature. Leafa, who had already loosened up after the encounter with Yui, then found out that Kirito got lost and decided to thank Kirito by treating him to a drink, which Kirito planned to use as an opportunity to find out more about ALO, especially about the World Tree. At Kirito's request, the duo decided to travel to the nearest town,Swilvane. Before they depart, Kirito noticed that Leafa was about to take flight without using the controller and asked her how she was able to do it, therefore she showed him the trick to Voluntary Flight. Kirito's first ""attempt"" at Voluntary Flight. After a humorous first attempt at flying without a controller, with Leafa's help Kirito soon grew accustomed to Voluntary Flight and they proceeded with flying towards Swilvane at high speed. Unfortunately, Kirito realized he still did not know how to land and crashed into the Tower of Wind. At the city, after a brief encounter withRecon, Kirito and Leafa entered an inn and pub where they ordered their refreshments. Kirito and Leafa at the «Lily of the Valley Pavilion» pub. Kirito then asked Leafa about the World Tree, as he wanted to get to the top of tree, and learned that it was theGrand Questof ALO, as the first starting race to reach the top of the tree would be turned into the legendary race of ALFs and that nobody had managed to complete this quest yet, even though the game had been online for a year now. Surprised by Kirito's determination to reach the top of the tree as soon as possible, no matter how difficult of a task it was, and seeing the familiar despair in his eyes despite his smile, Leafa volunteered to take him to the capital ofAlfheim,Alne, where the entrance to the World Tree lay. As there was no method of instantaneous travel in ALO, they had to fly to the city, which would take hours. As Leafa had to log out already, they agreed to meet up again the next day and Leafa told him that he can use the inn room to log out, as logging out instantly can only be done inside the player's home territory, by using a tent, or an inn if outside of the player's home territory. Kirito promising to Yui to reunite their family. Puzzled by Leafa's actions, though grateful for her help, Kirito decided to follow her advice and use the inn room to log out. As a sudden change from standing to a lying down caused a strong sense of vertigo, he decided to use the ""sleep off"" approach to log out, literally falling asleep, which would automatically log him off. As he laid in bed, Yui returned to her original form and asks whether she could sleep with him before he logged out. Although surprised by the request, understanding Yui's wish to be exposed to new data, he agreed and made room for her. He fell asleep as he promised to Yui that, as soon as Asuna was safe, they would purchase a house in-game and live as a family again. Kirito and Leafa rotating. As Kirito and Leafa left for the World Tree the next day on January 21, under Leafa's advice, Kirito decided to buy some new equipment to replace his starting equipment. As a replacement for his beginner's sword, he purchased a sword as large as him. Both departed Swilvane by the Tower of Wind to gain an altitude boost. After fighting some aerial monsters, both eventually took a rest after their wings' flying time was depleted. They then decided to rotational logout to have one of them protect the other's body while the other took a short break in the real world. Kirito and Leafa fought through manyorcswhile heading towards the neutral mining town ofLegrue. As Leafa explained to Kirito about Spriggan magic, she also told him to remember the chanting, as it could save their lives one day. Yui detected many players coming behind them, and so both fairies hid in a gap in the wall, and Leafa cast ahiding spellto cover the gap up. After a short time of waiting, Kirito noticed a bat coming towards them, and Leafa realized that it was a high-level tracer. She quickly destroyed it and told him to run, stating that the bat was a fire-attribute familiar, and therefore Salamanders were pursuing them. Kirito as the Gleam Eyes like creature. As the two tried to reach Legrue, the Salamanders cast a high-levelEarth Wallspell to block the entrance of the town. Kirito asked Leafa to act as support by healing him when he was hit while engaging the enemy head-on. The Salamander party cornering them consisted of three tanks and nine mages. Kirito tried to attack the tanks, dealing some damage, but three healer mages quickly healed them while the other six offense mages then cast offensivefire spellsat Kirito, greatly injuring him. As the fight progressed, he tried to get close to the tanks and tried to move their shields, but was forced to jump back after the mages cast another set of fireballs on him. As Leafa provided Kirito amagic-protection shieldby Yui's advice, Kiritotransformedinto a Gleam Eyes-like creature and easily ruined the Salamanders' formation, sparing one to interrogate. After being bribed with the items Kirito had received for killing the other Salamanders, the mage told them why they had gone after the two. After the mage was given the items and happily left, Leafa wondered why Recon was sending messages and under Kirito's advice, logged out. After logging back in, she told him what the problem was, and that he should work for the Salamanders, but he refused and decided to assist Leafa with her problem. Kirito at the conference meeting. After rushing past groups of Orcs, they exited the caves, and headed towardsButterfly Valleyto try to stop the Salamander attack force from killing leaders ofCait Sithand Sylph that are going to sign treaties. As the leader of the Lancers,Eugene, was about to order the lancers to attack them, Kirito landed with a boom, and expressed a wish to speak with the commander of the attack force. After Kirito told the commander that he was an ambassador to the Spriggan-Undinealliance, being there for ""trade"" reasons, and that the Salamander attack would be considered as a war declaration against the four races, Eugene thought that he was bluffing because of his gear and having no guards with him. Thus Eugene challenged Kirito, which he accepts and both began to fight. By taking advantage of his Dual Blades proficiency in SAO, as well as aSmokescreenspell to surprise his opponent, he quickly defeated Eugene and left players who watched the battle were in a state of shock at the fact that a Spriggan had managed to defeat the strongest player in ALO with weapons inferior to Eugene's Demonic Sword Gram that have magical ability. Under Kirito's request, Eugene was revived, and, after being revived, he contemplated on Kirito's statement of the Spriggan-Undine alliance. Kagemune then came out from the Salamander ranks and lied about Kirito having ties with an Undine, ""confirming"" this alliance, thus Eugene and his troops left on good terms, as they did not want to wage war on 4 races simultaneously. After the fight, the two leaders attempted to seduce Kirito into joining their respective army, however he declined their offers, stating that he needed to get to the World Tree to see someone. As the alliance had just started and the group was low on money to buy gear, he gave them a large package of coins each worth 100,000Yrd, which they gratefully accepted. He quickly left with Leafa and both flew towards Alne. Before they could reach Alne in the early morning hours of January 22, the two triggered a trap that forcefully transported them toJötunheimr, a large and high-difficulty maze. There, they found and helpedTonkyagainst a group of Undine players and left the place successfully with it to reach Alne. After that, Kirito and Leafa decided to take a rest. After being notified by the system that maintenance was shutting the servers off for three hours, they decided to log off at an inn not too expensive, as Kirito was now broke. He asked Yui to find a cheap inn, and she pointed them to one and they both logged off. In the morning in the real world, Kazuto greeted Suguha and they decided to go the hospital together. Kazuto then told his sister that the government plans to use a local school tohold the students from SAO. The two later arrived at the hospital where Asuna was being cared for. After the visit, they go back to ALfheim. While walking through a street of Alne, Yui told Kirito that Asuna was right above them. In a desperate act to reach her, he blasted off to the World Tree, hoping to find her there. As Kirito was flying towards the World Tree, Leafa tried to warn him of a barrier the admins had put after several players nearly managed to reach the top of the Tree that way. He tried to attack the barrier but to no avail. Yui then used her Warning mode to contact her, and Asuna eventually heard her voice. She then dropped an admin card, and Kirito caught the card, not knowing what it was but knowing that Asuna had heard them. As Kirito went to the base of the World Tree to get to the top, two Guardian statues blocked the door and asked if he was willing to challenge the Grand Quest. Kirito's Remain Light. Kirito quickly accepted the challenge and ascended towards the top of the tree. As he flew upwards, multipleGuardian Knightsspawned and tried to stop him. After killing several of them, he tried to speed up and reach the top, but got hit by a ranged guardian. More ranged guardians appeared and tried to stop him; however, he ignored the arrows and tried to get to the top. The melee guardians then started throwing their swords at Kirito, successfully hitting him and causing him to stop and bleed out from the damage, turning into a Remain Light. Kirito began to have doubts about his strength, having flashbacks from SAO. He was then rescued by Leafa, who revived him outside the World Tree. As he apologized to Leafa and told her that he needed to rescue Asuna, Leafa suddenly realized that Kirito was actually Kazuto, and called him big brother. Kirito then realized that Leafa was actually Suguha, who logged out in disbelief. Kirito quickly logged out of the game and tried to comfort Suguha, but to no avail. Afterwards, Kazuto leaned against the door before falling in sorrow. Kirito and Leafa hugging in the air. After some thinking, Kazuto got back up and told Suguha that he would be waiting for her on the north terrace of Alne. There, he was soon joined by Leafa, who proposed having a duel to express their feelings. During the battle, Leafa fell and let her sword go, intending to be slashed by Kirito, but instead he caught her, shocking both of them. Kirito then told Leafa that he wanted to apologize to her, but he did not know what to say and wanted her to have a free hit on him. After both quickly apologized to each other, they met up with Recon and the three begin their second attempt on the World Tree. As Yui believed he could reach the top because of his speed, Kirito decided to play the role of the attacker, while asking Recon and Leafa to provide support as healers. Guardian Knights began to spawn again, and Kirito easily killed many of them, amazing Recon in the process. As Kirito tried to reach the top, a large number of Guardians blocked him, and while healing Kirito, a few Guardians began to target Recon and Leafa. Recon quickly took some out, and then used theSacrificespell to remove a large number of Guardians. Kirito then tried to get to the top again, but another large group of Guardians blocked him and they quickly refilled the gap caused by Recon's Sacrifice spell. The Guardians began to charge towards Kirito, impaling him multiple times and prompting Leafa to heal him. Kirito piercing through the army of Guardians. As Leafa was about to be attacked, the Sylphs and a squad of Cait Sith Dragoons arrived on time. They stated that they had come to help Kirito as he had helped them with their preparations greatly earlier. The combined forces destroyed many Guardians, and Leafa tossed her sword to Kirito. Kirito then used the two swords to wipe out many Guardians with his slashing speed and ended up at the top of the World Tree. As Kirito tried to open the door, he was unable to because, as Yui told, the door was not locked by the quest, but by admins instead. As the Guardians spawned and surrounded him, he suddenly remembered about the admin card Asuna had dropped to him earlier. He gave it to Yui, who transferred the code to open the door, reaching upper levels of the World Tree. Kirito finally reuniting his ""family"". As Yui and Kirito explored the area, Kirito realized that the Floating City atop the World Tree had been a lie along with the quest. Yui then found Asuna's location, and, after they reached the location, removed the gates, allowing Kirito and Asuna to meet again. Kirito suddenly drew his sword as he sensed an enemy coming, and Yui disappeared. The scene then transformed into a black space, and Oberon appeared, binding them both with gravity magic. Oberon then stabbed Kirito with his sword, and then sets thePain Absorption levelto 8, causing Kirito to feel some of the pain. Kirito killing Oberon, Nobuyuki's avatar in ALO. As Kirito helplessly watched Oberon abuse Asuna, Kayaba appeared and told him to re-think the fact that human will could overcome the system and give him his admin ID and password. Kirito then came to his senses and got back up. When Oberon tried to kick him back down, Kirito stopped the blow midway and accessed Kayaba's ID ""Heathcliff"" and then revoked Oberon's admin privileges. Enraged, Oberon tried to spawn Excalibur, but the system ignored his request. Kirito then repeated the same command to spawn one and gave it to him, while setting the Pain Absorption level to 0, which made Oberon panic. Kirito then told him not to run, as Kayaba had never run from him during their fight. Oberon cursed Kayaba for interfering with him, even after his death, and he tried to attack Kirito, but Kirito parried his attacks with no effort and then quickly sliced and dismembered him which let Oberon started trembling from the pain and tossed him up to stab him in the right eye, killing him, and then freed Asuna. Kazuto heading towards Asuna's hospital. Kirito then logged Asuna out, and after he was the only one left, Kayaba came out and talked with him again. Kayaba gave Kirito «The Seed», and then told him he could do whatever he wanted with it. He then disappeared, and Kirito called for Yui and promised her that the two would come back to ALfheim and start again. Kirito quickly logged out to the real world, where he was met by Suguha, who was worried about him. At that moment, he informed Suguha that Asuna was back in the real world and Suguha let him go to the hospital so that he could meet her again, which he quickly agreed to. He got his bike and started riding towards the hospital where Asuna was being taken care of. Nobuyuki attempting to kill Kazuto. As Kazuto ran towards the entrance of the hospital, he was cut by an attacker. He then realized that his right arm was bleeding, and identified his attacker as Nobuyuki, who, despite being in a lot of pain, declared his intent to kill him. As Kazuto was unable to defend himself from Nobuyuki because of his bleeding arm, Nobuyuki tried to kill him but missed because of his eye being blurry. As Nobuyuki tried to perform the finishing blow again, Kazuto's thoughts of Asuna gave him the willpower to stop Nobuyuki and disarm him. Kazuto then smashed Nobuyuki's face into a van and put the knife to his neck. Thinking of all the things Nobuyuki had done to him and Asuna, Kazuto almost killed him but in the end let him live. Kazuto headed towards the hospital, where he reported Nobuyuki and got some of his wounds treated, before grabbing a guest card so that he could go to Asuna's room. He then met Asuna for the first time in real life and, hugging each other, they shared a kiss. Kazuto and Asuna meeting each other in real life for the first time. Months later, in school, Kazuto had just finished a class and headed outside to meet up with Asuna. Kazuto told her about all the recent news, also mentioning the arrest of Nobuyuki and the end of his inhumane experiments. After a while of chatting, Kazuto quickly spaced out while thinking about Kayaba and his seed. After Asuna got Kirito out of his train of thoughts, the two enjoyed the sandwiches Asuna had made for lunch. SAO survivors congratulating Kazuto for completing SAO. After school, the two and Suguha head towards the Dicey Cafe to attend the Aincrad Capture Commemorative Party. As they opened the doors of the cafe, they were surprised that everyone was already there. Shortly afterwards, everyone congratulated Kazuto for completing SAO. Kazuto then went to the bar, where he was joined by Ryoutarou, Thinker and Andrew. Andrew showed the progress of «The Seed» to the three. Kirito heading towards New Aincrad. Kazuto later logged into ALO, which was now owned by a new company, to bring Leafa to the afterparty. After he caught her falling from the sky, Leafa asked him to dance with her. Later, Kirito grabbed Leafa's hand and took her near the World Tree, where he showed Leafa the Floating Castle New Aincrad, and told her that they were going to clear all one hundred floors this time. More players showed up, heading towards New Aincrad and Kirito muttered something that surprised Leafa and Asuna, before encouraging them to start moving."
What was the name of the nurse who took care of Kazuto during the SAO incident?,Aki Natsuki,Phantom bullet arc,"On December 7, 2025, Kazuto was called by Kikuoka Seijirou, the man in charge of net crimes division, to a pastry shop to chat. Kazuto learned about the GGO players found dead in their homes, as well as the player calling himself «Death Gun» who harassed them prior to their disconnection from the game. After hearing about the potential threat to MMO game security Kazuto agreed to investigate GGO for a fee, and notified Asuna of his decision to convert his avatar, though he kept the reason secret. Six days later, a hospital room was set up for Kazuto to FullDive in, withAki Natsuki, the nurse who had taken care of him during the SAO incident, assigned to observe him for any abnormalities in his condition during the dives. Upon entering GGO at the hospital, Kirito was stunned at the extremely feminine appearance of his avatar. Though initially disappointed and discomforted at its lack of intimidation and aggressive aura, Kirito determined it would still help him be conspicuous among the players of GGO and attract Death Gun's attention. Having become lost while trying to find the location where registration for the Bullet of Bullets was being held, Kirito attempted to ask another player for directions. Upon realizing that the person was female, he became concerned that the girl would think he was just flirting with her, rather than being genuinely lost. However, being mistaken for a girl due to his appearance, Kirito was instead offered her assistance. Kirito decided to make use of the misunderstanding and inquired on the location of the administrative office and an equipment store. As the girl was heading for the administrative building as well, Kirito was escorted to the marketplace along the way. Kirito dodging the NPC gunman's bullets in the Untouchable! minigame. At the marketplace, the two realized that Kirito only had starter funds after his conversion. When Sinon offered to lend some credits, Kirito declined the offer due to guilt and instead enquired about gambling within GGO as a way to quickly earn money. Thus, he was directed to the bullet dodging game namedUntouchable!, the objective of which was to get as close to an NPC cowboy gunman as possible while dodging his gunfire. After learning the mechanics ofBullet Linesfrom Sinon, Kirito decided to try the game himself. Using his previous experience with NPC targeting, he managed to evade the cowboy's shots by following his eyes, and touch the NPC's chest, winning the jackpot. Kirito using the Kagemitsu G4. Kirito used all his funds in buying a photon sword, a Kagemitsu G4, an FN Five-Seven and some equipment to participate in the 3rdBullet of Bullets event. After a rush through the city, he and Sinon entered the tournament. During the tournament, Kirito used an original battle style of deflecting incoming bullets with his sword. Kirito and Sinon managed to get into the finals held the next day, although Kirito was shocked by his encounter with Death Gun. Kirito comforting Sinon. The next day, Kazuto was confronted by Suguha, who discovered that he was mentioned in a video games news site as one of the participants of the Bullet of Bullets tournament. Kazuto waited for the afternoon to head to the hospital. Before he logged into GGO, he shared his guilt of having killed threeLaughing Coffinmembers to stop them from harming others and then forcefully forgetting about their deaths. In response, he was comforted by Natsuki, who reminded him of his right to save others and himself. Upon entering the game, where he saw Sinon and asked her to tell him more about the finals. In the tournament finals, while trailing Pale Rider by hiding underwater, he was able to avoid the Satellite Scan and thus unintentionally sneak up on Sinon. He and Sinon then witnessed Death Gun dispatching Pale Rider despite their efforts to stop him. Afterwards, they trailed Death Gun to the central city on the stage, where Kirito took out Musketeer X, mistaking her for Death Gun, and returned just in time to save Sinon from the real Death Gun, who had been hiding with aMetamaterial Optical Camouflage Mantle. They managed to escape and hid in the desert, where Sinon told him her past, which Kirito responded to by comforting her. Kirito duelling against Death Gun. After talking for a while, they figured out the secret behind Death Gun: he attained the addresses of some of the players by using his mantle to peep on them while they were using the in-game terminals and inputting personal details. His accomplice would then kill the selected targets in the real world by injecting a lethal dose of a drug. Realising this, Kirito and Sinon prepared a plan to defeat Death Gun, using Kirito as bait. Initiating their plan, Kirito stepped out of the cave while Sinon prepared her equipment. Trusting Sinon to take care of their other opponent,Yamikaze, Kirito focused on sensing for Death Gun's location. After Sinon defeated Yamikaze and destroyed Death Gun's sniping equipment, Kirito engaged with him in battle, in which Kirito discovered the identity of hisopponent. During the battle, Kirito had a difficult time gaining the upper hand. However, he later sensed Asuna's hand which reminded him of the existence of his pistol, which he then used to imitate the «Double Circular» Sword Skill with the gun and his sword, finally killing Death Gun. Once they were the only two competitors left, Kirito and Sinon exchanged personal details and planned what to do next. The tournament then ended when Sinon used a gift grenade to have them both killed at the same time, thus ending the tournament as a tie. After logging out, Kirito hurried over to Shino's house and arrived just in time to save her from Death Gun's firstaccomplice. Two days later, he visited Shino's school and took her to meet Seijirou. After discussing the recent incident, he brought her to the Dicey Cafe, where they met with Asuna and Rika, as well as a woman Shino had saved during the incident in the post office."
What was the name of Kirito's second sword?,Holy Sword Excalibur,Mother's rosario,"After seeing both Lisbeth and Leafa relatively easily defeated by «Absolute Sword Yuuki», Kirito decided to try dueling her himself, using only a single sword. Midway during the duel, he had a suspicion about his opponent and asked her whether she had completely become a resident of the virtual world. Instead of a response, Kirito was assaulted with a high-speed attack and lost the duel. Kirito later appeared in front of the27thFloorboss room to prevent a large guild from interfering with the Sleeping Knight's attempt at beating theFloor Boss. As the guild attempted to launch various spells at him, Kirito revealed hisOutside System Skill«Spell Blast» - using Sword Skills to strike the centre of the incoming spells to neutralise them. He then drew his second sword, the «Holy Sword Excalibur», to distract the guild long enough for theSleeping Knightsto enter the boss room. He, along with Klein, held off the guild for three minutes before succumbing to the overwhelming numbers. Several days later, Kazuto pointed Asuna to the hospital Yuuki was in when Asuna told him she wanted to meet her again. He then helped the Sleeping Knights clear the 28thFloor with his friends. Sometime later, he faced against Yuuki in the ALO Duel Tournament finals using only a single sword but ended up losing again."
Where did Kirito meet a teenage woodcutter named Eugeo?,a fantasy style forest,Alicization arc,"Recruited by Kikuoka for an experiment with a new form of VR system, developed by the mysterious companyRath, Kirito awoke in a fantasy style forest with no memory of how he got there. There, he met a teenage woodcutter namedEugeo, who seemed too lifelike to be an NPC. Kazuto met Shino at the Dicey Cafe, where they talked while waiting for Asuna to arrive. When she arrived, they showed Shino that Asuna was able to monitor Kazuto's pulse via the monitor he had implanted for his part-time job. They proceed to talk about Kazuto's part-time job, which involved FullDiving using a new generation FullDive machine. After Kazuto's long explanation about the theory of the new generation device, they departed and Kazuto insisted to accompany Asuna to her house. But just before arriving, he noticed that they were being followed, and faced the stalker, Kanamoto Atsushi . He defended Asuna, but was injected withSuccinylcholineand was later taken in an ambulance. Although Kazuto managed to survive, he suffered severe brain damage. Secretly, Kazuto's body was intercepted by the Kikuoka Seijirou as he was supposedly being transferred to a different hospital. Kazuto's body was taken to theOcean Turtlewhere he was connected to the Soul Translator to treat his damaged neural pathways.[29] Kirito awoke in a forest in an unknown place, wondering where he was. He heard a strange noise and at the source of the noise, he met a boy called Eugeo, who explained to him the basics of the world and took him to his hometown,Rulid Village. In the town he met other people, and decided to stay there. Kirito unintentionally causedSelka Zubergto run into a certain cave and get captured, causing Kirito and Eugeo to go after her. They defeated theGoblins, but Eugeo was heavily wounded. Kirito awakened Selka, who was lying in a cart, and Selka, with Kirito's assistance, saves Eugeo. They all returned back to the village. Eugeo finished his currentSacred Taskand chose his next: to be a swordsman. Several months had passed since Kirito and Eugeo had left Rulid Village and had been working as stable boys for a family of farmers. On the 28thDay of the 8thMonth they participated in theZakkaria Sword Arts Tournament, where he facedEgome Zakkarite, a sixth class noble, who used a stronger sword to have an advantage against Kirito, but the latter used his «Snake Bite» Sword Skill to break Egome's sword and win. Months later he, along with Eugeo, enrolled in the Norlangarth Sword Master Academy, and became valets for the elite swordsmen. One day, Kirito was training with his mentor,Sortiliena Serlut, and after the practice, he returned to his dorm and spoke to Eugeo, who reminded him that the next day, after a complete year, he would receive theswordthat was carved from the branch of theGigas Cedar. When he returns to the Academy with his new sword, he practiced his Sword Skills to show them to Sortiliena later, but when he attempted to perform a five-hit Sword Skill in the forest to challenge the limit of his new sword in secret, he lost control and stained the shirt ofVolo Levantein, the head elite swordsman who was watching him, with mud. As punishment, he had to spar with Volo, who tried to win in one hit as always, but Kirito stopped him with the four hits of «Vertical Square». Asupervisorintervened and declared a tie, thus ending the duel. Kirito had become an elite-swordsman in the academy, and thus, he now had a valet. One and a half months in the new school year, on the 17thof the 5thMonth, he entered his and Eugeo's room from the window with a bag of honey pies, took a pair for Eugeo and himself, and gave the rest to their respective valets,Tiese ShtolienenandRonye Arabel. Eugeo reminded him that they have a test onSacred Artsthat he was not good at, so he stayed in his room studying while Eugeo practiced. Days later, he went to a picnic with Eugeo and their valets, where the latter revealed to Kirito and Eugeo aboutHumbert Zizek's mistreatment ofFrenica Szeski, his valet. Since Eugeo was flustered, Kirito accompanied him toRaios Antinousand Humbert's room to discuss the matter with them; the nobles played dumb and the matter was left as such. Days later, Kirito was maintaining his sword with Eugeo, and both were waiting for their valets to arrive. They became worried when it turned out that the valets were running late and Kirito decided to look for them, exiting through the window. When he returned to his room, Frenica informed him that Ronye, Tiese and Eugeo were in Raios and Humbert's room. He arrived at the scene just in time to stop Raios from killing Eugeo. As they faced each other, he inexplicitly transformed his sword from a one-handed to a two-handed one and used Whirl Current to beat him, and, at the same time, cutting his arms off. Kirito and Eugeo were arrested for breaking the Taboo Index and were given into Alice's custody the following day. They were then taken to the prison under theCentral Cathedralby Alice. They managed to escape from the prison and arrive at the courtyard of the Cathedral, where they faced the Integrity KnightEldrie Synthesis Thirty-one. After an intense battle, Eugeo recalled that Eldrie was the winner of the Four Empires Unity tournament held the previous month. Noticing that this revelation could highlight some peculiarities in Eldrie's memory, Kirito joined Eugeo in awakening Eldrie's memory, which caused the Knight to enter a state of shock. As more and more of Eldrie's life details were revealed, a purple prism began to protrude out of Eldrie's forehead. However, at this point,another Integrity Knightattacked the youngsters by firing arrows at them with abowfrom atop a flying dragon. Kirito and Eugeo then began to retreat into the Cathedral's garden, while getting directions fromCharlottepulling Kirito's hair in a certain direction at every crossroad. Once they arrived at what seemed to be a dead end, they were called by a young looking girl to escape through a door which Kirito had not noticed before. Thus they entered theGreat Library Room, where the girl introduced herself asCardinal. In the library he was separated from Eugeo by Cardinal for her to tell him her story and what had happened in Underworld before requesting his help to overthrow Quinella. After Cardinal finished her story, he said that he wanted to save her and the people of Underworld. After reuniting with Eugeo, Cardinal helped the two swordsmen create their ownArmament Full Control Arts, before the two headed out into the Central Cathedral again. Once they were back in the Central Cathedral, they made their way to the Equipment Vault where theBlue Rose Swordand Kirito's black sword were being kept. Upon finding their swords, they were then found by Deusolbert, whom they then fought against and defeated. After Deusolbert was defeated, he asked them to kill him, as he had failed his task, and therefore he would be punished accordingly. However, they rejected his request, until Eugeo heard the knight's name, and remembered that he was the one that took Alice away. Eugeo then wanted to harm him, however he was then stopped by Kirito. They then continued on their way up to the top of the Cathedral. On the way to the 29th floor, they metFizelandLinel, who claimed to be ""Sister Apprentices"" which was soon proven to be false, as the girls paralysed Kirito and Eugeo with poisoned daggers, while revealing that they were in fact Integrity Knights. The girls then made their way up to the 50thfloor, dragging the paralysed duo with them so that they could be executed in front of the other Integrity Knights. Once they reached the 50thfloor, it was revealed that Kirito had determined that the girls were lying before they paralysed Eugeo and himself and noticed that they were carrying blades made from «poison steel from Ruberyl», so while Eugeo was chatting with them, he had chanted an antidote Sacred Art to counter the effects of the poison. He paralysed both Fizel and Linel, and then requested to battle withFanatio Synthesis Twoin an individual duel. However, Fanatio declined the offer, thus Kirito was forced to fight four other Integrity Knights while Fanatio recited her «Armament Full Control Art». Kirito defeated the four Integrity Knights, and leaped at Fanatio with «Sonic Leap»; however, as he reached the peak of his jump, she finished her «Armament Full Control Art» which upset the trajectory of Kirito's Secret Move as it hit him with a powerful ray of light. Kirito continued to defend against Fanatio, and after getting an upper hand, he found out that Fanatio was a woman. Eugeo took a hand in the fight, and used his Blue Rose Sword's «Armament Full Control Art» to freeze Fanatio. Even though Fanatio was frozen for a few moments, she broke through the ice with herHeaven Piercing Sword. She activated her «Armament Full Control Art» once again, which Kirito countered with his own «Armament Full Control Art». Due to the fight, Fanatio was mortally wounded, so Kirito decided to use the dagger, which Cardinal had given to him to use on Administrator, on Fanatio to save her life. After Cardinal took Fanatio to save her, Kirito and Eugeo made their past the door that the knights were guarding, where, instead of stairs, they found the Cathedral's equivalent of an elevator and met a young girl who was known by the name ""Elevating Operator"". She took Kirito and Eugeo to the 80thfloor where they met Alice, sitting in the «Cloudtop Garden» waiting for them. Alice spoke to the two boys, telling them that she had thought Eldrie would be sufficient to cope with the two prisoners in the off chance that they escaped; however, they had surprised her by defeating him, as well as Deusolbert and Fanatio, who possessedDivine Objects. Alice placed her hand on the tree, stating that she would have to fight them, and herFragrant Olive Swordappeared in her hand, revealing that the tree was her sword in its original form. As Kirito began to attack, the Fragrant Olive Sword split into several petals, capable of killing with ease. Kirito suggested a fair fight, and Alice agreed. Kirito attacked in hopes of surpassing the knight with chain attacks but failed. Due to the Fragrant Olive Sword's high level of Priority, Kirito could only defend himself until Eugeo intervened and froze Alice. Alice broke herself free but, before she could reassemble her sword, Kirito unleashed his Armament Full Control against her sword to keep Alice occupied while Eugeo used Cardinal's dagger. However, the clash of between the two Armament Full Control Arts resulted in a torrent that struck the supposedly indestructible wall and created a hole, which sucked Kirito and Alice out of the Central Cathedral."

How did Asuna's personality change after meeting Kirito?,"She soon takes most things Kirito says to heart and looks to him for help, using him as somewhat of a lifeline",Personality,"Asuna originally did not care about dying in the game before meetingKirito. That meeting drastically changed Asuna's personality and outlook on life. She soon takes most things Kirito says to heart and looks to him for help, using him as somewhat of a lifeline. Asuna is a kind and helpful young woman who, similarly to Kirito, cannot abandon another in trouble. She takes the game very seriously and is determined to clear it before Kirito tells her to enjoy SAO a bit. Asuna is also somewhat proud and despite her kind personality, she will not hesitate to get physical with those that challenge her authority or make fun of her abilities, such as cooking. She even challenged Kirito to a duel after an argument over how to handle aField Boss. She is not afraid to act out on her own and will take matters into her own hands from time to time. Asuna, in a similar manner to Kirito, is someone who can be controlled and manipulated by her emotions. This is evident during Kirito's final duel withHeathcliffon the 75thFloor, when she resisted her paralysis, jumped in front of Kirito, and took an attack that would have otherwise killed him. She also cannot handle seeing others die in front of her, such as when she recklessly attackedThe Gleam Eyesafter seeing theAincrad Liberation Forceplayers getting slaughtered. In ALO, after being saved by Kirito, Asuna's personality had not changed a bit except that she was not as proud as she was in SAO. Her personality began to develop further still after meetingYuukiin the events ofMother's Rosario. Seeing how Yuuki still moves forward, despite knowing her death is inevitable, Asuna takes after her and resolves to keep moving forward, no matter what happens."
How many Iron Rapiers did Asuna take with her?,five,Aincrad arc,"By December 2, 2022, Asuna had spent three to four days battling in the1stFloor'sLabyrinth, having taken five Iron Rapiers with her and planning to return as soon as her last one was at half durability. Around 04:00, after dispatching aRuin Kobold Trooperon the dungeon's nineteenth level withLinear, she leaned against the wall and sank to the floor, when she was approached by a male player, who critiqued her use ofSword Skillson nearly dead enemies as wasted effort. Just as Asuna finished declaring her belief that death was inevitable either way, she collapsed from exhaustion. When Asuna awoke seven hours later, she found herself outside the Labyrinth, having been moved to safety by the boy. Before she could leave, she was informed of the First Floor Boss Raid Strategy Meeting taking place in «Tolbana» that afternoon and decided to visit the meeting with the boy. Upon reaching town, the two parted ways briefly. Asuna and Kirito eating bread. The two eventually met up again while Asuna was buying bread. Kirito decided to share cream with her, which he had obtained from aquestand gave the bread a surprisingly good taste. Asuna thanked him for the bread, but explained she was not there to eat food. She explained her reason for coming, and Kirito apologized. At this point, Asuna mentioned it was time for the meeting, and the two went to it. The meeting was to organize a large raid to explore the Labyrinth and find the entrance to the boss room. The next day on December 3, the Boss Room was found, which prompted another meeting. After discussing the information they knew, they were informed thatArgo's self-published guide had information regarding the boss from the beta period. They planned to attack the boss the next day, and Asuna and Kirito decided to party up as they were the only ones without apartyalready. During the planning, their party was decided to be a support group for attacking the smaller mobs in the room. Though Asuna disagreed with this, Kirito explained that it made sense, as they were only two people. After the meeting, Asuna and Kirito were to have a conversation regarding something he had said during the meeting, but Asuna did not want to have it in public. While considering other possibilities, Kirito mentioned that he had a floor in a farmer's house, with a view and a bath, the latter of which caught Asuna's attention. She requested the location of other such rooms, but Kirito revealed he had rented the entire space and he could not cancel the transaction. As all the other rooms in the village were likely taken and trying to find another in the previous village after sunset was dangerous and would render her tardy for the boss meeting, Asuna quietly asked him to let her use his bath. When they reached the farmhouse, Asuna was shown to Kirito's lodgings on the second floor and offered the bathroom, though she was told that the NerveGear could not adequately recreate a liquid environment. Asuna simply and sincerely stated the hot bathwater would be enough for her and entered the bathroom, but was somewhat dismayed at the door's lack of a lock. Reassuring herself that the swordsman was not the type to intrude and he could not harm her within the Area even if he did, Asuna breathlessly examined the exquisite details of the bath, which would be more appropriately located in a medieval European manor. Removing all of her equipment, Asuna quickly reached the bathtub and held her head under the shower from the bath sprout for a moment before allowing herself to fall back and splash into the water. Feeling completely relaxed with no regrets, she began wondering when she had developed such a strong appetite and urge to bathe, and how the details of the virtual world, flawed as they were, appealed to her more than that of the real world. However, Argo, who had met with Kirito to discuss the offer on hisAnneal Blade, decided to enter the bathroom to change her clothes. Noticing the sudden intrusion, Asuna screamed and delivered a blow that knocked him unconscious. The next day on December 4, the two joined the raid group and headed for the boss room. After reaching the room, the players went into the formation planned in the meeting, and everything seemed to go well until the boss's health dropped below a quarter. At this point, the boss pulled out its secondary weapon which, unexpectedly, was a katana, and not what was originally predicted. This resulted in the boss using Sword Skills that everyone was unfamiliar with and the death ofDiavel. In his last words, he called for Kirito to defeat the boss in his absence. Along withAgil, Asuna assisted Kirito in finally defeating the boss. Kirito alone climbed the stairs to the2ndFloorand, after reaching the top, Asuna came up behind him to speak with him briefly. She asked him how he knew her name, and he proceeded to explain that, when in a party, ahit pointbar is displayed in the top left corner of the player's vision and under it are the health bars of the player's party members, along with their names. He advised her to join a guild if someone she trusts invited her, before he headed to the nearest town to activate theTeleport Gatethere. On December 8, 2022, four days after the first boss was defeated, Asuna later encountered Kirito, watching a scene of a player arguing with SAO's first known blacksmith,Nezha, because he failed aweapon enhancementfour times in a row. After the commotion was cleared, Kirito and Asuna talked and Kirito decided to help her gather more materials for enhancing herWind Fleuret. On the field she made a bet with Kirito that she could kill 50waspsfaster than he could and, in the end, won the bet. Kirito, consequently, had to pay for their dinner, and Asuna choose a restaurant, recommended by Argo, which had a very tasty, but expensivedessert. After eating, they found out that they got a luckbufffor eating the dessert. Afterwards, Kirito took her to the blacksmith from earlier in order to try for another upgrade on Asuna's Wind Fleuret. Despite there being a 97% success rate, the blacksmith failed and her Wind Fleuret seemingly shattered due to a new, previously unheard-of penalty, which the blacksmith then told them about. With tears in her eyes, she resumed walking with Kirito. They sat on a bench and later checked into an inn. Minutes later, Kirito abruptly entered Asuna's room and made her materialize all her items. Under the big pile of materialized equipment, Asuna's Wind Fleuret was somehow found. She asked Kirito to explain how he got her beloved weapon back and he explained to her about the dropping weapon system and the scam that the blacksmith was pulling. As Asuna and Kirito ascended the stairs to the3rdFlooron December 14, 2022, Asuna was informed by the latter that the appearance of human enemies from the 3rdFloor onward marked the true beginning of Sword Art Online. Wondering if Kayaba Akihiko had been planning his crime from the very beginning, Asuna pondered on the referral of Sword Skill clashing against Sword Skill as a concerto of life and death. She remarked the basic definition of a concerto did not match the design behind many of the battles in SAO, though she added that she could be overthinking the matter. Seeing that her partner was walking backwards right towards the doors at the top of the stairs, she tried to warn him about it, but he collided with them and tumbled through the doorway before she could do so. After Asuna marvelled at the surroundings for several moments, she was given the choice to either join Kirito for a task, or disband the party. Sensing that the errand would best handled before restocking on supplies at the main town ofZumfut, she bluntly chose the former option. While they traveled the road to the next town, she listened to Kirito's description oftheir current locationand its residents and interjected to warn him ofa monsterapproaching behind them. After the monster was dispatched, Asuna was asked to listen for the clashing of blades, until both of them heard it southwest of their position. Following the clanging of metal on metal for less than five minutes, Asuna and Kirito soon found a clearing wherein twoNon-Player Characters, a light-colored man anda dark-colored woman, were locked in combat with each other. While Asuna was stunned at the realism of the NPCs, she was informed by Kirito that they were a Forest Elf and a Dark Elf, respectively, as well asquestgivers fora campaign questthat lasted until the 9thFloor. She was also warned that they could only choose one of the sides, with no option of restarting the campaign or switching sides. Asuna decided to follow the same route Kirito had taken in the beta and suspected he had chosen the Dark Elf. Just as she was about to join the Dark Elf, she was stopped by Kirito, who warned her of the impossibility of beating the Forest Elf, as both NPCs were elite monsters. However, she was reassured that the moment their hit points dropped below the halfway point, the Dark Elf would aid them with a special attack to win the fight, thus they only had to concentrate on defense. When the pair stepped into the clearing, both elves ordered the humans to leave, but Asuna and Kirito ignored them and pointed their blades at the Forest Elf. As the elf directed his aggression towards them, the fencer acknowledged her partner's reminder to focus on defense, but nevertheless regarded her opponent with a determined look. Twenty minutes later, while the stunned Forest Elf collapsed in defeat, Asuna remarked on the relative easiness of the battle, with both her and Kirito's hit points being just above half. Once the Dark Elf secured a bag that the Forest Elf had dropped on his death, the two were invited to the Dark Elf Base, where they would be remunerated by the Dark Elf Commander for their aid. After fifteen minutes of hiking and fighting monsters along the way, the trio arrived at the base around 17:00, where Asuna and Kirito started the next quest in the campaign upon claiming their rewards. Following formal introductions with the Dark Elf knight, named Kizmel, the two accepted her offer to make use of her tent. After taking a bath and eating dinner, Asuna and Kirito joined Kizmel in her tent at 19:00 for sleep. Awaking early the next morning on December 15 after eight hours of sleep, the girl left the camp with her companions for the second part of the campaign. During their search for the Queen Spider's Nest within the forest, the group encountered twoThicket Spiders. After dispatching the monsters, the trio chose to go in the direction from which the spiders had appeared to find the spider nest. Following four more battles with the spiders, Asuna, Kirito, and Kizmel located the cave that served as their nest. However, as they were about to finish investigating the cave's first floor for their quest, the group noticed that Kibaou,a player in a chain coif, and four other members of the Aincrad Liberation Squad had entered the cave as part of the guild creation quest, prompting the trio to hide until the players reached the stairs to the second floor. However, moments after the party located a Dark Elf scout brooch required for their quest, they overheard Kibaou's party retreating fromNephila Regina, the queen spider boss of the nest. Asuna's group decided to assist the fleeing party by discreetly defeating the boss, acquiring the queen spider's poison fang in the process. Once Asuna and Kirito delivered both the scout's emblem and the queen spider's fang to the Dark Elf Commander to complete their quest by dawn, they had anew rapierforged for the fencer before electing to return to the main town. Along the way, the duo witnessed Lind, a swordsman in a chain coif, and three other members of the Dragon Knights Brigade siding with the Forest Elf questgiver for the Jade Key quest against a different Dark Elf. Having reached the town at around 10:00, Asuna and Kirito spent some time resting and leveling up prior to attending the Clearers' strategy meeting for the 3rdFloor seven hours later. Afterwards, due to disagreeing with the ALS's and DKB's methods, the girl decided they should stay at the Dark Elf Base for the remainder of their time on the Floor. Over the next three days, Asuna and Kirito remained at the Dark Elf Base while strengthening themselves and completing the Elf War campaign, pausing only to participate in the battle against the Field Boss The Indolent Treent on December 18. Having returned to the camp later that afternoon, they resumed working on several more quests with Kizmel's assistance for four hours before retiring for the night. At 13:32 on December 21, 2022, Asuna accompanied Kirito on the stairs to the door to the4thFloor. Upon learning that the carved relief on the doors had been altered from the beta, she sensed the change in pictures corresponded with a change in the floor's design, a conjecture that was proven to be correct when they discovered a fiercely rushing mountain stream beyond the door. Having sent a message to Argo, notifying the information broker about the defeat of Nerius the Evil Treant, Asuna approached the river in front of them, where she realized that the only method of navigating the 4thFloor's now water-filled canyons was to swim through them. Before Asuna could take any action to address the issue, the girl's attention was drawn to a tree with donut-shaped fruit behind the staircase by Kirito. Realising that the fruit could be inflated into inner tubes, Asuna reluctantly agreed to Kirito's suggestion to remove her heavy equipment, before the duo swam further into the river, allowing the current to carry them downstream. After reaching land and reequipping their gear, the pair arrived at the northern gate of the main city ofRoviajust before 14:00, where they chartered an NPC-ownedgondolato the Teleport Gate plaza. Once they activated the Teleport Gate around twelve minutes later, Asuna and Kirito retired to a small inn at the edge of the plaza. Awaking several hours later at 18:00, the girl joined the boy for an early dinner at the food carts in the square, where they were approached by Argo with a map of all the quest NPCs in Rovia under Kirito's request. After paying the info broker for her services, the two traveled to the northwestern quadrant of the city, believing that a quest that had not been present in the beta test there would hold crucial significance in conquering the 4thFloor. Having found the NPC quest giverRomoloin a large old building there, Asuna unexpectedly helped Kirito deduce that Romolo was a shipwright when she happened to notice a half-rusted, long, square nail on the floor inside, which allowed them to initiate theShipwright of Yorequest. For the first part of the quest, Asuna and Kirito journeyed to the forest southeast of Rovia to gather bear fat. Due to the girl's insistence on collecting only the highest quality versions of the quest materials, the pair trekked through the woods for three hours in search of thebear kingrumored to live in the area. Immediately after they found claw markings that demarcated the bear king's territory, Asuna and Kirito were assaulted by the monster. While evading the bear's attacks, the duo discovered that they could collect Noblewood Cores by manipulating the monster into ramming trees. Deducing that the wood would be required for the next part of the quest, they continued guiding the bear into ramming trees until they filled their free storage capacity with wood. At that point, the two switched to active close combat and eventually defeated the monster, whereupon they returned to Rovia. Having arrived at Romolo's home at 23:50, Asuna and Kirito delivered the bear fat and the other crafting ingredients to the NPC and configured the design of their gondola, which they decided to name The Tilnel after Kizmel's sister. Once the gondola was completed at 04:30, Asuna joined the boy for a ride through Rovia's waterways, where they encountered several surprisingly abrasive NPC gondoliers. This antagonism was followed by an update of their quest log, prompting them to return to the old shipwright, who directed them to stealthily follow a large ship carrying wooden boxes when it departed Rovia around evening. Exhausted from their activities, the pair agreed to rest and inform Argo of their progress on the Shipwright of Yore quest before proceeding any further. After resupplying and eating lunch about ten hours later, Asuna and Kirito circumnavigated Rovia's southeastern quarter in search of the gondola from Romolo's description. Once they identified the boat around 16:30, the two stealthily followed it out of the city into a submerged dungeon, where they saw the crew handing the boxes to Fallen Elves. Though exhausted from attempting to relocate the ship when they had lost track of it earlier while navigating the dungeon, Asuna and Kirito decided to continue the quest by investigating the boxes. Having managed to evade the guards while sneaking through the Fallen Elves' hideout, they discovered where the crates had been stored but to their surprise found them empty. At that moment, the duo were forced to hide in one of the boxes when the Fallen Elven General N'ltzahh and several of his subordinates marched close to their position, where they overheard a discussion about the Fallen Elves needing materials for an unknown plan that would begin in five days hence. Sensing her partner had gleaned something from the conversation after the NPCs had left the area, the girl decided they should leave the dungeon before he could explain his deduction. When they returned to Rovia by 03:30, however, she collapsed into an exhausted sleep before the boy could share his knowledge with her. Having rested from their night adventure, Asuna and Kirito relayed the Shipwright of Yore quest details to Argo, who published the information not connected to the Fallen Elves in her strategy guide that afternoon. While the Clearing guilds used the guide to construct enough gondolas of their own, the pair finished quests and scouted the attack patterns ofBiceps Archelon, the Field Boss guarding the caldera that granted access to the southern half of the 4thFloor. As soon as the raid party was ready, they began their battle against Biceps Archelon at 15:00 the next day on December 24. Once the Field Boss was vanquished, the fencer and her partner exited the caldera for the nearby village of Usco to celebrate their victory, being joined by Argo along the way. While the trio briefly rested in Usco, the girls learned the ALS and DKB had purposely neglected to invite Kirito to a Christmas party in Rovia at 17:00. Though Asuna had received an invitation to the party during the field boss strategy meeting earlier, she explained to the boy she was disinterested in celebrating the holiday in such an ostentatious manner. Shortly after Argo left to gather information on the village, however, it began snowing, reminding the girl how she had wished to see such an event on Christmas back on the 2ndFloor. Although she insisted they did not need to hold their own private Christmas party when they obviously had not prepared for it, she agreed to let her partner take her to a special place to compensate for not planning for the holiday. Once the two finished resupplying, Asuna allowed Kirito to steer The Tilnel further downriver, arriving an hour later at the Dark Elven stronghold ofYofel Castle. Having gained entry to the fortress, the girl followed her partner to the central courtyard, where they joyously reunited with Kizmel. After a sumptuous dinner together, the three relaxed in Yofel Castle's bathing, during which the players learned the base's defenders had grown complacent due to the stronghold's position in the middle of a large lake. In the middle of Kizmel's explanation of how the Forest Elves consistently lacked enough ships to launch an effective naval assault, however, Kirito suddenly declared the Forest Elves actually would have enough ships to attack Yofel Castle in three days. Her partner's statement about the ships reminded Asuna of his discovery that the Fallen Elves were dismantling the boxes from Rovia's Water Carriers Guild into ship construction materials, leading her to realize he was indeed right. Then the humans informed Kizmel of what they had found in the Fallen Elves' hideout, whereupon the trio hurried to notify ViscountLeyshren Zed Yofilis, the reclusive master of the fortress, of this new development. After the three reported the Forest Elves' impending assault on Yofel Castle to Yofilis, they were assigned to retrieve the Lapis Key to send it and the Jade Key to a higher floor while the fortress prepared for the siege. Therefore, Asuna, Kirito, and Kizmel spent the next two days completing quests that eventually allowed them to enter the dungeon holding the key and return to the castle by sunset. At noon on December 27, the trio joined the rest of Yofel Castle's navy in facing the Forest Elven fleet when the latter appeared. Despite managing to sink several enemy ships from aboard The Tilnel, they failed to prevent the Forest Elven flagship from breaching the naval defenses and landing at the fortress dock. Though Asuna panicked over how there was seemingly no way to improve the situation, she and Kizmel assented to assist the castle gatekeepers in keeping the invaders at bay while Kirito separated from them to find help. To her surprise when the boy returned five minutes later, he was followed close behind by Yofilis, whose presence boosted the morale of Yofel Castle's defenders and granted them buffs. Thus empowered, the fencer was able to help repel the invaders, even stunning the Forest Elven commander's adjutant enough for her partner to deal the finishing blow. In the aftermath of their victory, Asuna temporarily left the boundaries of the lake in order to check for any messages sent by Argo during the siege. Subsequently, she discovered that the Clearers had discovered the Floor Boss chamber that morning and already opted to launch their boss raid that same day. The girl quickly relayed the news to Kirito, Kizmel and Yofilis, whereupon the players were informed to their dismay the Floor Boss was said to be a hippocampus with the ability to flood the boss chamber. Concerned at the possibility of the raid party drowning but unable to sent them a message due to the Clearers having already entered the Labyrinth, the pair elected to rush there to help however they could, with the Dark Elf knight and the viscount declaring they would be accompanying them. Following the defeat of Wythege the Hippocampus, Asuna and Kirito arrived atKarluin, where they activated the town portal and spent the night at an inn. The next day on December 28, after restocking their items, the duo devoted most of the day to completing quests. As twilight approached, Asuna remembered how serious Kirito had looked while recounting theplayer killing on the5thFloorin the beta test, and thus she decided to request him to teach her the basics of player versus player combat. However, the duel had to be cancelled just as it started as Asuna was unable to force herself to face Kirito in combat. Having returned to Karluin after 19:00 that evening, Asuna followed Kirito through the southern part of the town to the BLINK & BRINK inn, where she was introduced to the limited-supply Blue-Blueberry Tart dish. When they finished their dinner, the girl learnt that the dessert granted a buff that highlighted relics scattered throughout the city. Upon learning that the relic-hunting bonus only lasted for an hour, while the relics themselves would likely never respawn once acquired by someone, Asuna persuaded the boy to embark on a relic hunt before the buff effect expired. After spending the next hour relic hunting, Asuna and Kirito teleported to Rovia at around 21:30, where they borrowed a gondola from Agil to travel to Yofel Castle in order to claim their rewards from Viscount Yofilis. Having spent the night in the castle, the pair returned to Karluin at 08:20 the next morning on December 29 to continue completing quests. Upon finishing all the available quests in town by evening, the two decided to have dinner, during which they realized that Argo had, strangely, yet to release her guidebook for the 5thFloor. Worried, they attempted to contact her with a friend message to no avail, which indicated that the info broker was likely in a dungeon. Upon learning from Kirito that there was a dungeon in the catacombs beneath Karluin with a shortcut to the next town, however, Asuna dismissed Argo's prolonged stay in the dungeon as her simply being thorough in investigating it. The duo thus finished their meal, whereupon they decided to rent rooms on the second floor of the BLINK & BRINK for the night. On her way to the inn's communal bath past 21:00, Asuna noticed the boy surreptitiously leaving his own room, fully outfitted in his combat gear. Concluding that her partner was planning to search for Argo, she elected to follow him. Unable to reach or message Kirito before he entered the second level of the catacombs, Asuna decided to search each room on the floor for him. During her exploration, she was startled by an astral monster into accidentally triggering a trapdoor through which she fell to the third level. In order to brace herself for the impact, the fencer released her grip on her Chivalric Rapier, which was stolen by a Sly Shrewman that managed to escape before she could retrieve it. Terrified at the thought of being stranded alone in a dungeon without her best weapon, she spent the next fifteen minutes luring and dispatching every Sly Shrewman within range in hopes that one of them had her rapier. However, all of the shrewmen the girl hunted in that time only dropped regular items, the last of whom included a wad of paper. To Asuna's surprise, written on the paper were coordinates for a rendezvous on the third level of the catacombs at 22:00 that night. Intrigued by why a player would compose a handwritten memo when it would have been more convenient to use an instant message, she quickly proceeded to the location of the meeting, where she hid herself in a hollow. Several minutes after Asuna concealed herself, two cloaked players arrived at the rendezvous point, one of whom carried a sword. From eavesdropping on them, she learned the swordsman's conspirator had persuaded one of the main Clearer guilds into defeating the Floor Boss on New Year's Eve while the other guild was occupied. While wondering why the accomplice would reveal his guild's internal activities to an outsider, the girl remembered the conversation she had with Kirito following her failed duel attempt against him the day before. Recalling the man in the black poncho who had manipulated the Legend Braves into committing their weapons enhancement scam, as well as Morte, the swordsman that had surreptitiously attempted to legally kill her partner in a duel on the 3rdFloor, she realized the two players were members of a PK group working to sow discord among the Clearers and set them against each other. Overwhelmed by these thoughts, Asuna unconsciously shifted her balance and accidentally kicked a pebble, alerting the cloaked men. Hoping to remain undiscovered, the girl dropped the paper wad to lure a Sly Shrewman into the room where the meeting was being held, successfully misleading the two players. To her horror, the shrewman she had attracted was the same one that had looted her Chivalric Rapier, which was now in the swordsman's possession upon the monster's death. Unwilling to risk her beloved weapon being used to kill another person, the fencer was about to reveal herself to the would-be player killers when she was interrupted by the sudden appearance of Kirito, who identified the swordsman as Morte and questioned how they had acquired the rapier. Sensing the growing tension between Kirito and Morte, Asuna decided she had to recover her Chivalric Rapier before the situation could escalate into violence. Having detected a Sly Shrewman spawning nearby as well as Morte's associate reaching for his weapon, the girl dropped the paper wad again to lure the monster while simultaneously screaming to startle the dagger user into dropping the rapier. Then, once the monster had seized it, the fencer dispatched the rodent and switched out her equipped Iron Rapier with the newly dropped Chivalric Rapier, thus restoring her ownership rights to her beloved weapon. However, her shriek had also attracted the attention of a large group of monsters, prompting Kirito to grab her and conceal both of them with hisHidingskill while the cloaked players were forced to retreat. After the monsters had moved past their position, she finally broke down from the terror of her ordeal, to which she was gently comforted by the boy. Once Asuna had recomposed herself, she joined Kirito in the resumption of his search for Argo. Less than an hour later, they found the information broker investigating the area boss guarding the shortcut tunnel that led to the next town of Mananarena. Thanks to Argo solving a puzzle that weakened the resilient boss, the duo were able to defeat it alongside the other Clearers on December 30. Afterward, they spent some time working on the Elf War campaign, quickly finishing its chapter on the 5thFloor before the next morning. During this time, Asuna and Kirito invited Argo to join them in the Dark Elven village of Shiyaya as thanks for the information broker's assistance in beating the catacombs boss and to discuss what the fencer had overheard from Morte and his partner. While Asuna and Argo relaxed in Shiyaya's bath in the late morning of December 31, the former expressed concern over the latter exposing herself to danger in the course of gathering information for the Clearers, on account of how her services were essential to progressing through the game. This led to the fencer being challenged to a mock swordfight wherein Argo demonstrated she was capable of dodging most attacks. Relieved to find the other girl could handle herself in combat, Asuna felt reassured enough to confess her apprehension toward PvP combat, an issue that had growing due to her experiences over the past few days. Consequently, she learned Argo was willing to risk her life because she valued her information services more than simple survival, just as Kirito refrained from returning to being a solo player because he wanted to protect his partner. At 03:00 on January 1, 2023, Asuna and Kirito teleported to Stachion. After the pair reserved their rooms at an inn, the girl learnt from her partner that he had been ambushed by a man in a black poncho in Karluin only a few hours earlier. Thus, she agreed to resume practicing player versus player combat in the morning before they proceeded any further with clearing the6thFloor. After breakfast the next day, Asuna and Kirito journeyed to the Dark Elf Base on the 3rdFloor to upgrade their weapons and armor, as well as privately practice dueling. After an hour of training, the two returned to Stachion at 12:30 to meet with Lind, Hafner, and Shivata to inform the Dragon Knights Brigade on the Flag of Valor, which resulted in the two parties coming to an agreement that Kirito would continue maintaining custody of the item. After the meeting, Asuna and Kirito began working on quests in-town, including the Curse of Stachion quest series. As part of the questline, the duo traveled to Suribus by nightfall to investigate a house owned by Pithagrus, the previous lord of Stachion. Having acquired a key needed for the quest from the haunted building after 21:00, Asuna and Kirito were about to leave the house when they were ambushed by Cylon, an apprentice of Pithagrus who had hired them to investigate his former master. Immobilized with a paralyzing gas, the pair was abducted by Cylon and his henchman to be transported back to Stachion as part of the quest. Shortly after leaving Suribus, however, the carriage carrying the duo was intercepted by a pair of player-killer gang members: Morte and his accomplice. Still paralysed, Asuna could only helplessly watch as Morte disarmed and killed Cylon in order to target them next more easily, resulting in a windfall of Cylon's valuables dropping to the ground upon his passing. Among this pile of loot, the girl noticed a gas mask and a small, skull-marked jar: the Namnepenth's Poison Jar the NPC had used to incapacitate them in town earlier. As the axeman drew near, Asuna and Kirito independently arrived at the same plan of action: to topple the jar by blowing on it. With their combined effort, the two managed to spawn a cloud of paralyzing smoke that forced their would-be murderer to retreat. Instead of following Kirito's lead and engaging the player-killers the moment the paralysis debuff expired, Asuna opted to lurk inside the cloud in wait of an opportune moment for a surprise attack by using Cylon's gas mask to shield her from the toxic fumes. Such a moment presented itself when Morte's dagger-wielding associate left his back exposed to her, allowing her to land a clean hit on him. With the dagger user knocked off-balance by the surprise attack, the fencer quickly pressed her assault to allow her partner to focus on Morte until they eventually managed to force their opponents to retreat. Having returned to Suribus, after breakfast the next morning on January 2, Asuna and Kirito examined the items they had obtained the previous night, which included the golden key from Pithagrus's mansion and an iron one dropped by Cylon. While surveying the keys, Asuna wondered how the player killers' interference had affected their ability to complete the Curse of Stachion quest. To their surprise, the duo found the quest log had updated to reflect Cylon's death and was instructing them to locate where to use the keys. Curious over how they could still continue the quest despite the quest giver being killed, the girl was inclined to return to Stachion to talk to Theano, Pithagrus's former maid who would have assisted them in the quest had it proceeded as normal. However, her attention was redirected by her partner to the weapons Morte and his confederate had dropped: a pair of poisoned throwing picks and a dagger, respectively named the Spikes of Shmargor and the Dirk of Agony, whose descriptions indicated they had been received from Fallen Elves. Concerned at the possibility that the player killers might have access to an unlimited supply of high-level poisoned weapons, the two concurred to prioritize investigating the throwing picks further. To that end, they needed to help clear the 6thFloor so they could contact Kizmel again. After Asuna and Kirito joined the Clearers at the front lines later that day, they helped with clearing the first of the four mountainous dungeons that sequentially blocked access to the rest of the 6thFloor. During the travel, the girl consulted her partner on how they could determine who among the ALS was Morte's accomplice, but to no avail. Once the pair gained access to the northwest sector of the Floor by defeating the first Field Boss, they separated from the Clearers to trek to the Dark Elven fortress of Castle Galey at the north end of the Floor, arriving there by sunset. Having reunited with Kizmel inside the castle, Asuna and Kirito explained the attempt on their lives and showed her the Spikes and the Dirk, which the Dark Elven knight confirmed had likely been gifted by Fallen Elves. To their relief, the duo learned Kizmel knew of a Dark Elven storyteller in Castle Galey that could possibly inform them how to counteract the Spikes' poison, who they could contact while working on the Elf War campaign. Since the trio could only visit the storyteller in the early afternoon, they decided to focus on retrieving the Agate Key after breakfast the next morning on January 3. With the aid of special Dark Elven equipment, Asuna, Kirito, and Kizmel were able to enter the south sector of the 6thFloor by crossing Lake Talpa in the Floor's center without disturbing the starfish monster Ophiometus inhabiting it, thereby bypassing the need to trek through the boundary dungeons. Having reached the key shrine, the humans were surprised to find the dungeon entrance locked with a thirty-five puzzle, when such puzzles were were supposed to be restricted to Stachion, though the Dark Elf was able to quickly solve it. Once the three had managed to secure the Agate Key, they returned to Castle Galey by 16:20 but were too late to meet with the storyteller. In February 2023, Asuna became the sub-leader of the newly created «Knights of the Blood» guild in SAO, shortly after the25thFloorwas cleared and, during the battle, the leading clearing guild, the Aincrad Liberation Force, was nearly wiped out. After joining the guild, she constantly disagreed with Kirito in the boss clearing strategy meetings on how to beat the field and floor bosses. Around the end of February 2024, Asuna and the other Clearers spent a week attempting to determine a way to circumvent theGeoCrawler, the Field Boss of the 56thFloor blocking the path to the local Labyrinth, as frontal attacks against it were ineffective, while its position prevented flanking the monster. On March 6, 2024, following Klein and Kirito's latest failed plan to overcome the boss, Asuna assumed control of the strategy meeting and proposed luring the boss into the local village, where they could attack its weak point from behind while it was distracted with killing the villagers. When Kirito argued against her plan, Asuna reminded him that clearing the game was their main priority. However, upon discovering that the Black Swordsman was one level higher than her, the Flash challenged the solo player to vindicate his belief through a first-strike duel. While Asuna initially managed to force Kirito on the defensive with her speed and short-delay-time Sword Skills, she was tricked into leaving herself open when he feinted drawing and striking with a second sword, resulting in her defeat. Later that night, as Asuna sat by herself outside one of the houses in the village, mulling over her loss and Kirito's attitude, she accidentally triggered an encounter with an NPC girl namedRuru, who approached her and inquired over the player's apparent lack of sleep. When the child began singing a lullaby for her, Asuna grew interested in the lyrics' reference to an iron-armored serpent falling asleep with the rest of the characters in the song due to a musician playing the lute. The next day on March 7, after Ruru's song was successfully used in conjunction with a player's Musical Instrumentsskillto subdue and defeat the GeoCrawler, Asuna declined to participate in the subsequent victory party. Seeing Kirito celebrating with Ruru, she realized the boy was not simply working to escape Sword Art Online but was also truly living in it. On the morning of April 22, 2024,[24]Asuna teleported to themain cityof the 59thFloor.[25]Seeing Kirito dozing on a hill next to the Teleport Gate plaza, she chided him for not actively assisting the other players in clearing the Labyrinth,[25]but grew surprised when he stated his preference to enjoy the day's pleasant weather settings.[26]Realizing how Kirito viewed his time inAincradas simply living in the virtual world, the girl sent the other members of the Knights of the Blood ahead and lay next to the boy, falling into a deep, peaceful sleep.[26] When Asuna finally awoke over eight hours later, she grew mortified to find Kirito watching her from right beside her; however, she soon realised he had been guarding her from player killers and thus offered the boy a free meal as gratitude for his consideration. While eating a salad at a restaurant inMarten, the two suddenly heard a horrified scream from outside, prompting them to rush to the source. There, they discovered amanimpaled with abarbed spearand hanging by his neck from a noose from a church's window, who seemingly died before anyone could assist him. Convinced that the player had been killed in a duel, the girl and the boy quickly searched for a duel winner notice, to no avail. Aware that panic and disaster would occur if there was a way to kill players within a safe zone, the two agreed to investigate the matter together. After retrieving the rope from the church, Asuna and Kirito returned outside to the plaza, where they found that a woman namedYolkowas the first person to witness the incident. Gently questioning her, they learned that the victim, named Kains, was one of her former guildmates who had had dinner with her just before his death. Upon escorting Yolko to the nearest inn and having other players spread news of the incident, the duo elected to examine the rope and spear for any further leads on the murderer. Since neither of them possessed an Appraisal skill, while her blacksmith friend would be occupied with business at the time, Asuna hesitantly acquiesced to Kirito's suggestion to contact Agil for assistance. With Kirito having sent a message to Agil beforehand, Asuna traveled with the boy tothe man's shopinAlgadeon the 50thFloor, where they had the shopkeeper examine the rope and spear with his Appraisal skill. The pair learned that the spear, named Guilty Thorn, had been created byGrimlock, a player unknown to Agil. Although apprehensive of locating someone willing to craft a weapon designed for player killing, Asuna and Kirito resolved to search for anyone on the middle floors who had been acquainted with Grimlock. After teleporting to the Town of Beginnings, Asuna, Agil, and Kirito investigated theMonument of Lifeat theBlack Iron Palace, where they verified that Grimlock was still alive, while a player named Kains had indeed died that day. As Asuna needed to return to the Knights of the Blood's headquarters, she and Kirito decided to resume their search for Grimlock the following day. Having reunited with Kirito for breakfast at 09:00 the next morning, Asuna was informed of how Schmitt of the Divine Dragon Alliance had forced her partner to surrender the murder weapon to him. Although the duo suspected there was a link between him, Grimlock, and Kains, they decided to not act on any assumptions until they had gathered more information. Upon meeting with Yolko an hour later, the boy and the girl learned she, Grimlock, and Schmitt had once been part of theGolden Apple, a guild that had acquired a rareagility-boosting ringabout half a year prior, yet subsequently collapsed when their guild leaderGriseldawas murdered for the ring shortly afterwards. Believing whoever killed Kains was connected to Griselda's death, the two secured Yolko's stay at her inn for several days to keep her safe. Afterwards, they elected to investigate the method used to kill Kains; though Asuna was surprised at Kirito's suggestion they consultHeathclifffor advice due to his trustworthy knowledge of SAO's mechanics, she agreed to send the guild leader a message. Once Heathcliff had joined Asuna and Kirito in Algade thirty minutes later, she followed her partner toa restaurantdeep within the mazelike city. As the trio waited for their lunch, the girl updated the guild leader on the events since the previous day and listened to her partner's theories about the Inner Area murder, occasionally offering her insights. However, each hypothesis was eventually debunked. After their meal, the pair were advised by Heathcliff not to rely solely on secondhand information. When Kirito expressed confusion, Asuna clarified that they should scrutinize the motives behind the dissolution of the Golden Apple over the rare ring. Consequently, she proposed they inquire Schmitt about his involvement, hoping to uncover new information. Having deduced Schmitt would seek the most secure location in which to hide, Asuna and Kirito journeyed to the Divine Dragon Alliance's headquarters on the 56thFloor shortly after 14:00, where the girl persuaded the heavily armored lancer to speak with them. While interrogating Schmitt on the whereabouts of Grimlock, Griselda's husband and the main suspect in Kains's murder, the two learned the blacksmith used to frequent a NPC restaurant; however, the man insisted on meeting with Yolko before he would reveal the establishment's name. Though confused by the nature of the request, they reluctantly accepted it after Yolko agreed via friend message. Once Asuna and Kirito had escorted Schmitt to Yolko's inn by sundown, the duo kept guard as the former Golden Apple members speculated who could have killed Kains and why. In the middle of the discussion, however, a black, barbed throwing dagger suddenly appeared in Yolko's back which had been facing her room's window. Before anyone could react, the young woman's avatar fell through the window to disintegrate on the street below. On June 24, 2024, Asuna visited her best friend, Lisbeth, at the latter's shop, and asked for Lisbeth to polish her rapier, the Lambent Light. During this time, Lisbeth deduced that Asuna was in love, and made Asuna promise to bring her new lover to the shop some time later. Two days later on June 26, after Lisbeth had createda new swordfor Kirito and as she was about to confess her feelings to him, Asuna burst into the shop in a panic. She explained that she was worried that something had happened to Lisbeth due to her having gone missing and being unreachable the day before. After Lisbeth explained that she had been stuck in adungeonand told Asuna that she had been in the dungeon with Kirito, Asuna, who only now noticed Kirito, revealed that Kirito had come to the shop because he had asked her for a place where he could get a strong sword. Lisbeth, who now harbored feelings for the Black Swordsman, realized that he was also the one Asuna loved and took her to a café inLindarthto confirm whether Kirito was the one Asuna was interested in. After Asuna confirmed this, Lisbeth revealed that Kirito had broken her best sword while testing its durability and that they had gone to a dungeon to finda rare raw materialin order to forge a stronger, better sword for him. After talking a bit about the adventure and Kirito, Lisbeth abruptly left under the guise of having an appointment and asked Asuna to keep Kirito company. Asuna was one of the participants of the crusade againstLaughing Coffin. After Asuna entered Agil's shop to find Kirito on October 17, 2024, Kirito asked Asuna to cook an ingredient he had found. He revealed that he had acquired aRagout Rabbit's Meat, an incredibly rare S-class ingredient. Even Asuna, who had recently completed her Cooking skill, had not seen such a rare ingredient before. She demanded to be given half of the rabbit if she cooked it. Kirito reluctantly agreed and the two headed to Asuna's flat inSelmburg, the main city on the61stFloor. After they ate their fill, Asuna persuaded Kirito to join her party, and the next day on October 18, they discovered the74thFloorBoss, The Gleam Eyes. They proceeded to hastily retreat to a safe area, where they later encounteredKleinand his guild, the «Fuurinkazan», and troops from «The Army». When «The Army»'s troops left towards the boss room, Asuna, Kirito and the Fuurinkazan followed behind, worried that «The Army»'s troops would get themselves into trouble. They were stalled by a group oflizardmenwhen they suddenly heard screams. Upon arrival at the door, they discovered with horror that the troops were unable to escape from the wrath of the boss due to the area being an Anti-Crystal Zone. Asuna rushed in to help, only to quickly endanger herself and, consequently, be rescued by Kirito. Together with Klein, she distracted the boss while Kirito prepared his «Dual Blades» skill, then watched with a combination of awe and terror as the two clashed with power she had never seen. In the end, Kirito defeated The Gleam Eyes and, suddenly overcome with fatigue, he collapsed to the ground, noticing that he only had a sliver of his hit points remaining. Asuna rushed to his side and, upon seeing his state, quickly healed him and then nearly crushed him in an overbearing hug. Shaking with a combination of fear and newfound emotions she had not realized were there until she had seen how her friend had nearly died, Asuna decided to take a break from her guild in order to spend more time with Kirito. When she returned to «Granzam» to apply for leave, Heathcliff told her that before he could grant her request, he wished to duel with Kirito. He set his terms: if Kirito won the duel, he would allow Asuna to have her requested time off, but if Kirito lost, then Kirito would have to join the Knights of the Blood. The two returned to Granzam so that Kirito could talk with Heathcliff himself, but he ended up accepting the challenge. Kirito was, ultimately, defeated.Godfree, the Commander of the Vanguard of the Knights of the Blood, demanded Kirito's prowess in combat to be tested, despite Kirito having nearly won a duel with Heathcliff. Before leaving on the test, Kirito confided in Asuna his dark past with theMoonlit Black Catsguild. She embraced him as he tensed up and whispered in his ear that she was not planning on dying anytime soon, so he needed to stop worrying about her. After Kirito departed with Godfree andKuradeel, Asuna anxiously watched the party's progress on her own map back at the KoB headquarters, not being allowed to join them. Midway into their trip, Asuna noticed Godfree's disappearance from the map and rushed to save Kirito with panicked, adrenaline-fueled speed that players were, supposedly, incapable of reaching. She narrowly saved Kirito from Kuradeel, who had betrayed them midway through the trip, but was unable to bring herself to kill the man, despite all of her anger towards him for nearly killing someone she cared a great deal about. In that moment, Kuradeel sensed his opportunity and struck, launching a surprise attack against her. Despite Kuradeel's advantage, Kirito was fast enough to deflect the blow, albeit costing him his own hand, and he then finished Kuradeel off. Upon realizing how her indecision had nearly killed both of them, Asuna collapsed to the ground in tears. She believed that her presence near Kirito had put him in danger, and through her tears told him that she wanted to stay away from Kirito, lest her presence once again be a liability upon him. Kirito, realizing that he was on the verge of losing her, chose to surprise Asuna by kissing her passionately. Asuna, while shocked, did not turn him away and instead melted into the kiss. Kirito solemnly declared his emotions for her, how he had come to realize that Asuna meant the world and more to him and that he would do anything to stay by her side. Asuna said the same to him, and Kirito requested that he be allowed to sleep with Asuna that night. Later that night, after finishing their dinner together in Asuna's place, Asuna nervously turned down the lights and slowly removed her clothing. Kirito was completely and utterly shocked and quickly explained that he simply meant he wanted to stay by her side that night and not what Asuna was implying. Embarrassed by the situation, Asuna shouted and attacked Kirito, though the «Area» effect stopped her. Once things had been cleared up, they finally did sleep together and, later that night, Kirito proposed to Asuna, which she happily accepted. On October 24, 2024, after sending messages to their friends and settling their request for a temporary withdrawal from the Knights of the Blood, Asuna and Kirito teleported to the22ndFloorfor their honeymoon. As Asuna and Kirito drew close to where the latter had first found the house, the sub-leader rushed ahead enthusiastically. However, the home was, surprisingly, no longer there. On October 30, 2024, while walking through the woods and while Kirito was playfully scaring Asuna with ghost stories, they saw a pale entity in the forest. Convinced that Kirito's stories were true, Asuna screamed and hid behind him, but Kirito realized that the entity was actually a young girl. They walked up to her and tried to talk to her, but she suddenly fell unconscious. They carried her back to their cabin where they waited for her to wake up. Upon waking up, the girl had no memories, save for her own name:Yui. They then decided to help Yui find her real family, as Yui seemed far too young to be alone in SAO. They took her to the «Town of Beginnings» on the 1stFloor where they took her to a church where many other young children trapped in SAO had taken residence, but the person taking care of the children there,Sasha, confirmed that she had never seen Yui.Yulier, the sub-leader of «The Army», suddenly showed up at the church and besought Kirito and Asuna for their help in finding her husband,Thinker, the leader of «The Army», who had disappeared several days prior in aHidden Dungeonbeneath theBlack Iron Palace. Yui stubbornly insisted on accompanying them. After descending into the dungeon, they eventually found Thinker in a safe zone. Yulier rushed forward, overjoyed at the sight of her lover safe, but was barely saved from being ambushed by a boss:The Fatal Scythe. Kirito quickly ordered Asuna to take Yui and teleport to safety while he distracted the boss, but Asuna defied him and instead pushed Yui into Yulier's arms and told them to take her out of there with them. Asuna and Kirito managed to deflect a single blow from the boss but were completely overwhelmed by the effort, as the boss nearly killed them with its first strike. They realized that its level must match that of the 90thFloor and above bosses and that it would easily kill them if they resist any further. However, while they were struggling to get up, Yui intervened, materializing a massive, flaming, two-handed greatsword, theObject Eraser. Yui deleted the boss from the game, and Kirito and Asuna followed her into the safe-zone that Yulier and Thinker had teleported from. There, they found an admin console, which, with admin credentials, could be used to control various aspects of the game. Yui revealed that she had recovered her memory and explained that she was actually an AI mental health counseling program that was sealed away on the first day of SAO's launch. After noticing a couple with unusual emotions, such as happiness, she developed a desire to be near Asuna and Kirito. However, Yui had been slated for deletion by theCardinal System, the program which oversaw SAO's processes, after it deemed her as a foreign body due to ignoring its orders. Powerless to do anything, Asuna clung desperately to her ""daughter"", but Yui was deleted in Asuna's arms. Asuna collapsed to the floor, overwhelmed with sorrow, and lamented Yui's death, but Kirito intervened. Using Yui's still active admin credentials, he accessed the admin console and transferred Yui's data to his own NerveGear's local memory and transformed her into a game object, calledYui's Heart, in the form of a tear-shaped necklace for Asuna to wear and remember her by. Two weeks later on November 7, 2024, they were called back by Heathcliff who explained that the next floor boss had been found, but was stronger than anticipated, as it had killed half of the members in the scouting party, while the other half were locked out of the boss room. Fearing for Asuna's safety, Kirito asked her to stay behind in the guild hall where it was safe. However, she refused and stated that she would kill herself if she found out that Kirito was killed in action, being unable to forgive herself for not going. After a short conversation about what their real life bodies must be going through, Asuna began to cry as Kirito embraced her in his arms. She told Kirito that she wished to be with him forever, to date in real life, and to truly get married. Later on, they joined the guilds in attacking the 75thFloor Labyrinth'sbosswhere, after defeating the boss, Kirito deduced and exposed Heathcliff's true identity as Kayaba Akihiko, the creator of SAO. Before challenging Kirito to a final duel, he put the other players in a state of paralysis. However, as Kirito was about to be struck down by Heathcliff, Asuna managed to move herself in front of the fatal blow, causing her character to die. Stricken with pain, Kirito continued fighting on, despite his HP reaching 0, and he managed to deal a fatal blow to Heathcliff with Asuna's rapier. After the battle, when Aincrad began to break down, Asuna and Kirito met once again in a special area created by Akihiko, who prevented them from dying because he wanted to talk to them, and told each other their real names. Afterwards they decided to kiss and fade away from the world as one."
How many days after her incarceration did Asuna escape her prison by using the passcode she had seen Oberon entering into the keypad beside the door?,sixty,Fairy dance arc,"Asuna trapped in the World Tree. Instead of being released from Sword Art Online, Asuna was among a group of three hundred players who were captured and diverted to ALfheim Online bySugou Nobuyuki, thus she found herself trapped in a large birdcage atop theWorld Tree. About sixty days after her incarceration, during one of Oberon's visits to the cage, she learned, to her horror, of his experiments on the SAO survivors under his control as part of an effort to develop a way to control the human mind. Past midnight on January 22, 2025, Asuna escaped her prison by using the passcode she had seen Oberon entering into the keypad beside the door. While trying to find a console that she could use to log out, she discovered thelab facilitywhere Nobuyuki was conducting experiments on the human brain. Though she was caught as she tried to log out, she managed to steal an administrator card before being returned to her prison. Upon Kirito's arrival and as he tried to fly up to the top of the World Tree, only to be stopped by the barrier, Asuna heard Yui's call and threw down the admin card she had obtained to Kirito. Later on, Kirito and Yui arrived at the cage and the three of them were reunited. Suddenly, Yui disappeared and they were pressed down to the ground by the use of Gravity Magic, cast by Oberon, who then chained and began abusing Asuna. However, Kirito managed to force himself up and, by accessing Heathcliff's account which had admin privileges, easily killed Oberon and then released Asuna from her chains. After resuming their short reunion, Kirito logged Asuna off. When she woke up in her hospital bed, she sat quietly, anxiously waiting for Kirigaya Kazuto . When he finally arrived, he was bloodied up by an encounter he had with Nobuyuki in the parking lot of the hospital, but after formally introducing themselves, as it was their first time actually meeting each other physically, they shared a passionate kiss. Several months later on May 16, Asuna was waiting for Kazuto to meet up with her on a bench outside of school, with both of them attending a school specifically targeted at SAO survivors called theSAO Survivor School. Asuna listened to Kazuto's explanation of how Nobuyuki was arrested and how Kayaba Akihiko had killed himself after having downloaded his consciousness to the Internet. Asuna later attended the «Aincrad Capture Commemorative Party» at Andrew Gilbert Mills's Dicey Cafe, along with other SAO survivors and Kazuto's sisterSuguhaand, later that day, joined them during the Floating Castle Aincrad update in ALfheim Online."
Where did Asuna join Shinozaki Rika and Ayano Keiko?,SAO Survivor School,Extra edition,"On July 25, 2025, Asuna joined Shinozaki Rika andAyano Keiko at the SAO Survivor School to help in teaching Suguha how to swim. During the training, she talked about how she met Kirito. Later she joined Kirito and friends for the «Deep Sea Plunderers» quest in ALO."
How many days after Asuna and Kirito were gathered together in the room that Asuna and Kirito had rented in ALO in Yggdrasil City was Asuna and Kirito gathered together in the room that Asuna and Kirito had rented in ALO in Yggdrasil City?,1,Phantom bullet arc,"After Kazuto's meeting withKikuoka Seijirou, Asuna was waiting for him in front of Otemachi Station, the Chiyoda Line on December 7, 2025, almost one year after her return to the real world. As she was waiting, she wondered about the ""real"" things around her, made up of atoms and not data, yet she felt that what had happened in virtual reality was also ""real."" As she mused this topic, she asked what were the differences between virtual reality and reality out loud. To her surprise, Kazuto suddenly answered from behind, saying that it was just the difference in the quantity of data. Taking her hand, they both walked into the East Garden of the Imperial Palace and looked at the Edo Castle ruins together. After discussing several topics about their future together, their friends, and Yui, Kazuto shyly revealed the fact that he would be transferring his ALO avatar to anotherMMOgame:Gun Gale Online. After Asuna's initial panicked reaction, Kazuto managed to calm her down and convinced her that he was only doing it because Seijirou, a government official who worked with Kazuto to uncover some events of SAO, she decided that it could not be helped and begrudgingly accepted that she would have to play ALO without him for several days, but insisted that the moment he was finished with Seijirou's request he would transfer his avatar's data back over to ALO. A few days later on December 14, Asuna and all of their friends were gathered together in the room that Asuna and Kirito had rented in ALO inYggdrasil City, watching theBullet of Bulletstournament live on a huge, 16-inch screen television in their home. While watching it, Asuna noticed strange behavior coming from a player calling himself «Death Gun», who had pinned down another player,Pale Rider, with paralyzing bullets froma large sniper riflein his possession. He walked over to Pale Rider's paralyzed body, raiseda small pistolto him, and shot him once, instead of finishing him off with his rifle. This caused fear to seep into Asuna's stomach, as she knew something was wrong with this player. Moments later, Pale Rider suddenly seized up and disappeared from the tournament, with the broadcast stating his connection had been interrupted. Death Gun turned to the screen and made an announcement, and Asuna quickly realized that the player calling himself Death Gun was actually a player of SAO, and worse still, a Laughing Coffin member. Fearing the worst, that this man was here to actually kill people, Asuna quickly logged out of ALO and contacted Seijirou in the real world, demanding he log into ALO to give an explanation as to what Kirito's true purpose in GGO was. As Asuna waited for him to log in, she suffered from severe anxiety and remembered the crusade that had destroyed the Laughing Coffin back in the last days of SAO. A huge raid party of fifty players, Asuna and Kirito included, had swept into the Laughing Coffin headquarters to finally destroy the evil, murderous guild once and for all, but, having been tipped off that the raid was coming, the red players set up an ambush. What had originally been intended - to simply lock up the Laughing Coffin members in the SAO prison so they could no longer harm anybody - quickly turned into a slaughter. Twenty-one of Laughing Coffin's members were killed, and eleven more of the raid party as well - thirty-two players in total dead forever. Finally, Chrysheight showed up, but before he could explain anything, Yui, who had been conducting research of her own, explained that there had been two mysterious deaths in the real world linked to this player, Death Gun, in GGO. What had just happened to Pale Rider was likely another murder, and it was revealed by Chrysheight that Kirito had been sent to investigate and possibly prevent anymore murders. Frustrated that she was unable to protect him, Asuna resolved to stay by Kazuto's side instead. She logged out of ALO and quickly took a taxi to Kazuto's location: a room in a hospital in Chiyoda, the same one he had stayed in during his time in SAO. After getting there, the only thing Asuna could do was watch the broadcast of the Bullet of Bullets tournament and hold Kazuto's hand while he was immersed in the game. It was due to the warmth of Asuna's hand against his, the sensation of his lover supporting him, that Kirito gained the strength he needed to overcome the Laughing Coffin player in the final battle of the BoB tournament."
How long had Asuna been under Full Dive? Available choices: (A). For how long? (B). For how many years? (C). For how many years? (D). For how many years?,(D).,Mother's rosario,"On January 6, 2026, Asuna heard rumors of a player who was said to be stronger than any other, and had been challenging anybody who cared to try it to a duel. Supposedly, this player had never been defeated even once. Asuna at first doubted that this player was as strong as everybody was saying, as she was sure that Kirito would be stronger, but was informed by Kirito himself that he had also been defeated in a duel. Her curiosity now piqued, Asuna tried to duel the mysterious swordsman, who went by the nickname of «Absolute Sword», herself. On the24thFloor, she came to the site where the swordsman was challenging players and found out that Absolute Sword was actually a girl named Yuuki. After both agreed to duel on the ground, an intense battle ensued, and Asuna nearly won, but an extremely powerfulOriginal Sword Skilldelivered by Yuuki defeated her. Despite Asuna's defeat, Yuuki suddenly seized Asuna's hand and dragged her along to the27thFloor. There, Yuuki invited Asuna to join her to defeat the 27thFloorbosswith her guild, the «Sleeping Knights». Together, after one failed attempt, they succeeded at defeating the boss, and their names were forever marked on theMonument of Swordsmen. Asuna later learned that Yuuki and other members of the «Sleeping Knights» were all terminally ill patients who had been underFullDivefor longer than even the SAO survivors. The benefit of Fulldive to them was the fact that, when immersed in VR, senses to the outside world could be cut off. Patients who were in great suffering could connect to a VR world and not have to experience the pain and suffering they might endure in the real world due to the VR interface intercepting their brain signals. It was possible for them to live life almost normally, to a degree, thanks to VR, despite their grave situations. To Asuna's great surprise, Yuuki had only a few remaining months before she died. She decided to help Yuuki experience life to its fullest with the help of Kirito'sVR probe, which could be operated by Yuuki through theMedicuboidthat she was using in the hospital, to attend school and walk among the streets. In the end, after Yuuki died, Asuna reflected on her attitude and way of life. She committed that no matter what hardship she would face in life, she would continue to fight for her happiness and refuse to give up, just like Yuuki."
Where did Asuna meet Nurse Aki?,second Soul Translator room,Alicization arc,"Asuna learned about the part-time job that Kazuto was doing. Soon after she found about this information in detail atDicey Cafe, she and Kazuto both left for her home. However, Kanamoto Atsushi , a vengeful former player of Sword Art Online from the guild Laughing Coffin and the remaining member of the Death Gun conspiracy, unleashed his anger on Kazuto, severely injuring the latter. Asuna quickly accompanied Kazuto to the hospital. After Kazuto disappeared from the hospital the next day, Asuna, Leafa, Sinon, and Yui deduced that he was kidnapped and taken to a turtle-like facility, known as theOcean Turtle, in the middle of the ocean. As such, Asuna requested the help ofKoujiro Rinkoin order to infiltrate the facility to find him. There, she learnt about Kazuto's situation, as well as details ofProject Alicization, from Kikuoka Seijirou and Higa Takeru. After the conversation, Asuna went to see Kazuto from outside the second Soul Translator room, where she also met Nurse Aki, discovering that she was a sergeant at the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force. At night, Asuna was visited by Rinko, who expressed her apology to Asuna as well as all SAO players by not interrupting Kayaba Akihiko's plan. Asuna responded that she did not have any resentment toward Rinko. The next morning on July 6, 2026, on her way to see the Main Visualizer, Asuna encounteredIchiemom, Takeru, and Rinko. Upon reaching the sub control room, Asuna rushed toward the passageway outside the Soul Translator room to see Kazuto. After a discussion about Ichiemom, Asuna and Rinko left the passageway to have breakfast. On their way, they encountered two Rath employees, who made Asuna feel uneasy. Later in the morning, while Asuna and Rinko were enjoying their breakfast, they were joined by LieutenantNakanishi, with whom they had a conversation about the Japanese destroyer Nagato, the ship escorting the Ocean Turtle. Not long after, the Ocean Turtle was attacked, thus Asuna and Rinko were asked by Seijirou to retreat to the upper shaft region of Ocean Turtle under the lead of Takeru."
How did Kirito and Asuna get their new rings?,a monk,Infinity moment/hollow fragment,"During Hollow Fragment, Asuna and Kirito were out shopping in Trader's Way, an area on the 76thFloor, when they suddenly realised that a system error caused by the battle with Heathcliff on the 75thFloor had corrupted and erased Kirito and Asuna's marriage status, leaving Asuna heartbroken and in tears. At first, Asuna was fearful that Kirito could have divorced her, but he assured her that he never did anything. Talking it over with the others, Kirito realized that it was a system error, as he could still propose to the other girls. With the aid of Yui, they discovered a quest where they can restore their marriage status. After reaching the 79thFloor, Kirito and Asuna arrived at a church within town, the site of the quest's beginning. They spoke to a monk who could forge them special rings, if they brought him a special material guarded by a powerful monster. After the pair retrieved the materials and brought it back, the monk crafted them a pair of translucent rings that were the key they need to complete the quest. However, to complete the quest, they needed to visit three other locations while wearing their new rings, and the locations were on separate floors. The first location to visit was the Lake of Purification on the 82ndFloor, where Kirito and Asuna had to ""purify"" themselves by both entering the lake's water while being naked. Though reluctant at first, Asuna managed to go into the water with Kirito, under the condition that he would not look at her. Their rings reacted when they both entered the water, and this excited Kirito to the point that he turned around, accidentally looking directly at Asuna. Shortly afterwards, Kirito thought to himself how he was afraid to say that Asuna was beautiful because of how she reacted to the situation. The next location was discovered by coincidence when Kirito found an ideal log cabin on a floor that reminded him of the 22ndFloor. With Agil's help, they purchased the house and surprised Asuna, who was overflowing with joy upon discovering it. After a brief scene, their rings glowed again, signaling they had found the «Nest of Memories». The final location was on the 86thFloor, where Kirito and Asuna found a beautiful church. Upon entering, a voice asked if they were here to pledge their love to each other. They were put to the test when a powerful knight-like monster was summoned into the room. After defeating it, they discovered that their rings had not changed, meaning that the final event had yet to be finished. However, after recalling how the voice spoke, they both realized that this was no different from a real wedding ceremony. And, after they kissed each other, their rings changed for the final time, becoming pure silver, signifying that their marriage status was restored."
How many battles did Silica have?,multiple battles,Aincrad arc,"On February 23, 2024, Silica was hunting in the Forest of Wandering with apartyshe had encountered two weeks prior. As they were returning to town around sunset, she got into a dispute withRosaliaover the distribution of healing items after the latter claimed the former having a Tamed Monster that could heal her exempted her from the allocation. Ignoring the party leader's attempts to defuse the argument, Silica left the party in anger and began traveling the Forest of Wandering alone, fully expecting her skills and Pina's support to be sufficient for her journey. However, she quickly lost her way due to thedungeon's unique design, forcing her into multiple battles and exhausting her healing supplies. Well after nightfall, she fell into an assault from multiple «Drunk Apes», becoming discouraged at the extent of her opponents' healing abilities. Fatigued from her constant fights, she made a miscalculated strike, opening herself to a counterattack that reduced her hit points to critical levels, thus causing her to freeze with fear. But as the Drunk Ape that had struck her launched a final attack, the blow was intercepted by Pina at the cost of its life, leaving only a tail feather behind. In a state of rage, Silica defeated the ape that had killed her partner and was about to engage the other two apes in a suicidal attack when the remaining apes were suddenly defeated by Kirito.

However, her resolution was broken when she discovered that she only had three days before the time limit for reviving a Tamed Monster expired.

Right outside the building, they encountered Silica's former party, including Rosalia, who taunted the Dragon Master for the loss of her familiar, prompting Silica to announce her plans of reviving Pina.

While waiting, Silica voiced her confusion over Rosalia's attitude, prompting Kirito to explainColor Cursors,Player Killing, and roleplaying in massively multiplayer online games to her. After finishing dinner past 20:00, Silica and Kirito retired to their rooms, where the former found herself unable to sleep. Wanting to talk with Kirito some more, she visited his room at around 22:00 and requested to discuss the 47thFloor in private. However, their conversation was overheard by an eavesdropper, who fled before they could catch him. Despite her unease, Silica was soothed into sleep as she watched Kirito write a message to someone. The next morning on February 24, Silica and Kirito teleported toFloriato begin their journey to theHill of Memories.

Although they successfully retrieved the Pneuma Flower there, Silica and Kirito were ambushed by Rosalia and the other members of the «Titan's Hand» orangeguildon their return trip. To her surprise, however, the orange players were effortlessly handled by Kirito and forced to teleport to the prison at theBlack Iron Palace. After the pair returned to the Weathercock Pavilion, the two promised to meet each other again in the real world as they revived Pina. On October 4, 2024, Silica invited Kirito to a meal at the Weathercock Pavilion in Mishe to celebrate the defeat of the 73rdFloor Boss. To her surprise, the boy unexpectedly mentioned a riddle she had given him the previous month, regarding the origin of her in-game name, as they reminisced about their first meeting.

Where did Lisbeth meet Kirito?,elementary school,Aincrad arc,"Lisbeth wishing Asuna luck on her meeting with Kirito. On June 24, 2024, Lisbeth was visited by Asuna to perform maintenance on the latter'sLambent Light. Teasing Asuna about meeting a boy, she listened to her description of him before proceeding to sharpen the blade. Despite teasing the Flash, Lisbeth secretly felt envy due to the fencer finding a potential boyfriend, and wondered if she would ever find someone who would care for her as well. Lisbeth watching Kirito accidentally break her best sword. The next day on June 25, Lisbeth was having a dream of an experience she had during elementary school in the real world when she was visited by Kirito, who came to purchase a custom sword similar to hiscurrent one. Though initially skeptical of his appearance and equipment, she became impressed by the high quality of the monster drop weapon. Thus, she offered her best sword, which was designed for speed. Shocked and angered when he accidentally broke her best sword while testing its durability versus the Elucidator, she vowed to create a weapon that would surpass his blade. Lisbeth reprimanding Kirito for destroying her best sword. Therefore, Lisbeth informed Kirito of aqueston the55thFloorin which acrystal eating dragonproduced arare metalthat she could use to craft a great sword. However, as the metal was rumored to drop only when a blacksmith was in theparty, she insisted on accompanying him on thequest. After gathering her equipment and supplies, she closed her store and followed Kirito to the 55thFloor, all the while wondering how she had gotten herself into her current situation. Lisbeth and Kirito arriving at the West Mountain. When the party arrived on the 55thFloor, Lisbeth found herself unprepared for the cold climate, thus she received a thick mantle from Kirito to keep herself warmth. After finding the quest giverNon-Player Character and accepting the quest, they began heading for the frost dragon's lair on theWest Mountain. When the pair reached the area by sunset, Lisbeth was ordered by Kirito to prepare her items and hide the moment the dragon appeared. The blacksmith initally protested but acquiesced upon seeing the swordsman's seriousness and genuine concern for her safety. Lisbeth quickly hid behind one of the crystal pillars in the area as X'rphan the White Wyrm emerged from a nearby large and deep hole in the ground. As Kirito engaged X'rphan in combat, Lisbeth became astonished at the swordsman's fighting skills, and pondered about his identity. When X'rphan'shit pointswere reduced to critical levels, she stepped from behind the pillar to urge Kirito to finish the battle. At that moment, Lisbeth was assailed by theboss' blizzard attack, which blew her over the hole the dragon had come from. Just as she began to fall, she was grabbed by Kirito, who slowed their descent and shielded her from most of the damage from the fall. After landing, Lisbeth accepted apotionfrom Kirito to recover her hit points, before wondering how they could escape from their situation. As their position was both adungeonand an Anti-Crystal Zone, they could neither contact their acquaintances with a message nor use acrystalto teleport. Lisbeth holding hands with Kirito just before sleep. Having resigned to the predicament for the night, Lisbeth watched as Kirito prepared a simple dinner and sleeping bags for them. After the meal, she listened to stories of his adventures on the front lines and inquired why he had risked his life to save her when he could have died failing to do so. Touched by his sincere reply that he would rather die with someone than let them die in front of him due to inaction, the blacksmith was overwhelmed by loneliness and asked to hold his hand. When he accepted her request, she held onto it as she fell asleep. Lisbeth shocked at learning the Crystallite Ingot was the dragon's excrement. After awaking the next morning on June 26, Lisbeth and Kirito found a Crystallite Ingot, the material they had originally been searching for, buried in the snow covering the bottom of the pit. The duo deduced that the rare metal had been produced by the dragon as its excrement, meaning that they were in its nest. Having stored the ingot, Lisbeth resumed contemplating on a method to escape from the hole, when she remembered that X'rphan would be returning to its nest soon, as it was nocturnal. Lisbeth hugging Kirito during their freefall. Just as Lisbeth prepared herself to fight against the dragon when it landed, she was suddenly grabbed by Kirito as he raced behind the boss and seized its tail. While she held onto the swordsman, the two were carried by X'rphan out of the pit and into the air, before Kirito released his grip on the dragon. Having safely landed with their ingot, the pair began their return journey to the smith shop. Lisbeth forging the Crystallite Ingot into a weapon. Once Lisbeth and Kirito arrived at the former's store, the blacksmith begancraftinga sword from the Crystallite Ingot, resolving to confess her feelings to the boy if she succeeded in forging a weapon he would be satisfied with. After the ingot transformed into awhite sword, Lisbeth waived payment for her services in exchange for becoming the swordsman's personal blacksmith. In August, 2024, Lisbeth was visited by Kirito toreinforcehis Dark Repulser +39 to +40. Lisbeth wondered to herself why he would go to such effort to upgrade his sword when it would have been considerably easier to find a new weapon that could match his current blade's stats. During the enhancement process, the blacksmith stopped hammering the Dark Repulser and expressed her fear that once the blade's reinforcement attempts were exhausted, Kirito would no longer have a reason to see her anymore. Upon being told of his belief that the Dark Repulser was meant to be used against the last boss of Aincrad, Lisbeth felt encouraged enough to complete the upgrade. After managing to successfully enhance the sword's sharpness, she professed her hope to not undergo such a stressful reinforcement attempt for a while, only to be asked to upgrade his Elucidator +39 to +40 as well. On November 7, 2024, Lisbeth had finished her quota of orders for the day and was considering what to eat for lunch when Hanna Heinemann, the NPC tending her store, suddenly vanished. Shocked, she left the building and heard the system announcement of the game being cleared. After a few seconds of stunned silence, she realized that only Kirito could have done such a feat despite the front lines being at the 75thFloor and declared her love for him at the top of her lungs, swearing to see him again."

The day after Kirito's victory in the duel, on March 7, the Clearers learnt that a lullaby could lull the GeoCrawler to sleep.

How tall is Edward Elric Edward at the beginning of the series?,"149 cm (4'11"")",Appearance,"Edward Elric Edward is small boy for his age, standing at only 149 cm at the beginning of the series, despite his attempts to appear taller, . He wears his golden-blond hair long - usually tied in a braid that hangs down to his shoulders, but sometimes forgoing the braid for a simpler ponytail. He parts his bangs in the middle so that they frame his face on either side as they fall and, in the center of the parting, he leaves a single strand of hair sticking up like an antenna. InChapter 56, it is revealed that he does this intentionally, presumably to add to his height. Ed's eyes, too, are gold, signifying hisXerxesianancestry. It is revealed in one of the Fullmetal Alchemist art books that the reason why Edward wears all black is to hide any oil stains that he may obtain from his automail. Early on in the manga, Ed receives a thin, horizontal battle scar just above his right eye, which remains because his subsequent battles cause the sensitive skin to tear open repeatedly. As ofChapter 76, however, the scar appears to have healed over completely. As the series progresses, some of Edward's facial features begin to take on characteristics similar tohis father's. At the end of the series, Edward is shown to have grown noticeably taller, being several inches taller than Winry and finally being at least equal in height to Alphonse."
What is the name of Ed's cloak?,Flamel,Clothes,"Ed wears as his trademark a bright red, long-sleeved, hooded cloak whose tail comes down to his upper calves. Emblazoned in black on the back is aFlamel, signifying his tutelage under the masteralchemistIzumi Curtis. It is likely that Edward fashioned this cloak for himself, as he needs to repair it often and, inChapter 85,transmutedone from scratch using a roll of red cloth. During the Elric Brothers' trip to the northern area, Ed's cloak was modified somewhat with a white fur trim around the hood to accommodate comfortable passage through cold conditions. Though Ed's clothes vary over the course of the series, he seems particularly partial to black and will nearly always dress in black trousers and some sort of black shirt under his coat. In his usual outfit, Ed primarily wears a sleeveless black shirt with a black jacket that has silver/white lining along the edges, along with a red trenchcoat-type jacket. This is his main outfit, and over the course of themanga, the jacket undergoes multiple changes. This is seen at the beginning of the manga where the jacket is longer and is tucked into his belt. However, when he first leaves Resembool, it hangs over his belt and has a zipper on top. The most common version portrays the jacket being connected at the top with a button, and falling slightly short of waist-length, making it possible to see his black shirt. He also wears a wide brown leather belt to which he keeps his silver State Alchemist pocket watch affixed. As part of his attempts to seem taller, Edward is rarely seen without his elevator shoes - black leather boots with thick, red soles. Additionally, he frequently wears white gloves when in public to conceal the fact that his right arm is artificial. It is likely that his general outfit is meant to convey a red, black, and white motif, as these three colors are considered significant in traditional alchemy."
Who did Greed kidnap Al to learn how to bond a soul to a suit of armor?,"The two were initially not on good terms, as Greed kidnapped Al to learn how to bond a soul to a suit of armor.",Greed,"The two were initially not on good terms, as Greed kidnapped Al to learn how to bond a soul to a suit of armor. Edward, as a result, fought with Greed before Wrath captured him. When they remet, Greed became Ed's enemy and followed Father's orders. Ed tried to reason with Ling . When the two met again, Edward asked Greed if he wanted to join him. Greed suggested instead Ed, Darius, and Heinkel be his subordinates, a proposition Ed accepted. Despite their arguments, alongside Ling, Ed became one of Greed's closest friends and the two worried for each other during their battle against Father and the other homunculi. Greed was happy to have sacrificed himself for his friends and thanks them. Edward was visibly horrified when Greed sacrificed himself to stop Father, and landed the final blow against Father as revenge."
How old is Edward Elric when he apprenticed under Izumi Curtis?,young,Abilities,"Despite Edward's small stature and young age, he is a remarkable combatant, academic, philosopher, and strategist. Having apprenticed under Izumi Curtis, Ed was taught to condition his body through regular workouts and sparring as part of her philosophy, ""to train the spirit, first train the body."" As such, his slight frame belies a compactly muscular build that, in addition to his naturally high energy level and endurance, fuels his considerable strength and agility which allows him to throw people much bigger than he is. Due to Izumi's Spartan training, Edward has become a particularly competent hand-to-hand fighter, able to hold his own against armed opponents and even skilled martial arts practitioners. Besides that, his steel right arm and left leg augment his fighting strength by adding to his defensive and offensive capabilities as well as his speed - after he is refitted with a lighter, cold-climate automail inChapter 70of the manga. Edward using alchemy without a transmutation circle. Transmuting part of his Automail Arm into a Sword. As suggested by his unprecedented acceptance into the State Alchemist program at such a remarkably young age, Edward Elric is an alchemical prodigy of genius level intellect. From early childhood, he displayed proficiency for alchemy, acquiring self-taught alchemy skills and comprehension from the advanced literature in his father's abandoned study at an age that shocked even his mother. Having incorporated alchemy into his life during his developmental stages, Edward sees the world alchemically and is, therefore, able to solve complicated codes, puzzles, and mysteries much more easily than normal. He has also shown himself to be exceptionally adept at chemistry and reasonably competent with biology; indeed even his preparations for the failed attempt to resurrect his mother were indicative of these. Edward's near-encyclopedic knowledge of alchemical theory is astounding and contributed to his incredible success with emergencySoul Bindingexperimentation. His feats as a child were so great that many initially suspected that he was a fully-trained adult alchemist rather than a ten-year-old boy. He shows an uncanny level of focus that allows him to effectively shut out everything from his surroundings and devote all of his considerable mental power to whatever problem demands his attention, especially in the case of books.

"What is the name of the character who is perceived as a shallow, self-absorbed and an incorrigible womanizer who is infamous among many of his colleagues and subordinates?",Roy,Personality,"Roy is perceived as a shallow, self-absorbed and an incorrigible womanizer who is infamous among many of his colleagues and subordinates. Easily as arrogant as his young protégé Edward, Colonel Mustang is one to act in an ostentatious manner and appears to act mostly out of self-interest rather than any sort of philanthropy. He often slacks on paperwork and other menial tasks, but is quick to take action when it appears that there is glory and military notoriety to be gained. Roy's usual demeanor. Roy also has a reputation of being a shameless flirt, and it's rumored that he spends much of his time cavorting about town with various women and wooing several of the servicewomen with his abundant charm, good looks and charisma. This adds another facet to his unpopularity among the enlisted men, many of whom fear having sweethearts and crushes romanced away from them by his hand. He has, however, never actually been shown to be on a serious date with any woman in the manga or 2009 anime; any flirtatious interactions he had with women seemed to be nothing more than a cover to discretely pass along information. However, while these traits do have a place in his real personality, much of his outward persona is a façade intended mask his ambition, and have those unfamiliar with him underestimate his remarkable intelligence and prowess. Mustang is an exceptional tactician, well-versed in various strains of combat theory and particularly talented in the realms of surreptitious information-gathering, covert operations and enemy ensnarement. Roy is expertly manipulative and prone to think several steps ahead of those around him, giving him a remarkable talent for making subordinates act exactly as he wishes despite appearing not to have had a hand in their decisions - all traits which make the fact that he has managed to attain the lofty rank of colonel at such a young age. Inwardly, Mustang harbors a deep ambition to lead the country, allowing no obstacle to hinder him on his path to the top. His own actions in theIshvalan Cival Warhave left him with haunting regret and a desire to bring to justice those who committed war crimes, even if this includes himself. Recognizing the corruption and futility stemmed from the war, Mustang seeks to lead the country himself to a better cause. At the core, he is a remarkably devoted commander with a strong sense of justice. Though he hides it well behind a veil of cynicism and self-importance, Mustang is a man who cares deeply about the people who trust and support him and goes to great lengths to ensure their safety and well-being, even at the risk of his own. As a man with considerable power, Mustang considers himself a protector to those without and acts accordingly, earning the staunch loyalty of his most trusted compatriots. Unfortunately, his self-imposed position as protector has caused him to display a penchant toward stubbornness in regards to his pride on the field and a fiery temper, both of which have been shown to cloud his judgment in certain situations."
Who is Roy's superior officer from his days at East Area Headquarters? A: General Grumman. B: Roy's superior officer from his days at East Area Headquarters. C: Roy's superior officer from his days at East Area Headquarters. D: Roy's superior officer from his days at East Area Headquarters.,A,Lt. general grumman,"Roy's superior officer from his days atEast Area Headquarters, General Grumman has played a sort of grandfatherly role in Roy's development as a soldier and officer. Having taught the young Flame Alchemist everything he knows about covert operations, subordinate coordination and womanizing, Grumman feels rather fondly for his protégé and is partly responsible for the young man's speedy rise through the ranks. Roy trusts him enough to seek the old man's help in dire situations."
What type of alchemy does Colonel Mustang use to manipulate the concentration of oxygen in the air?,flame alchemy,Flame alchemy,"An example of the power of Roy's flame alchemy. Even among the elite State Alchemists, Colonel Mustang is a particularly skilled alchemist adequately versed in standard physical transmutation, experimental theory, and biological alchemy. However, the brilliant skill that has earned him his state license, national notoriety and the status of ""hero"" during theIshval Civil Waris his remarkably powerful fire-based combat style. Mustang's unique style of combat alchemy is made possible by his custom-made gloves. Made of ""pyrotex/ignition cloth,"" these gloves create a spark when Roy rubs his fingers together and embroidered with unique flame alchemyTransmutation Circles, they allow him to manipulate the concentration of oxygen in the air. When attacking, Mustang raises the density of the oxygen surrounding his target to a level at which it becomes volatile and creates narrow pathways of oxygen between himself and his target through which he can direct the ensuing flash fire that blossoms from the spark of his gloves. As a result, he can incinerate any number of enemies in the field while deftly avoiding any adjacent allies. The 'snap' sound heard at the start of these transmutations is caused by the instantaneous speed at which the highly concentrated gases and sparks react together and pop As one may expect, Flame Alchemy is explosive, deadly, and nearly indefensible, stated by its creator to be ""the most powerful type of alchemy"" and acknowledged by the Homunculi as the most troublesome ability out of all State Alchemists. What makes Mustang so dangerous, apart from the sheer destructive potential of fire itself, is the speed of his transmutation. Unlike other fire-users in fictional media, Mustang does not ""throw"" or ""launch"" fire from his person, but rather explosive flames simply appear wherever he wishes them to at instantaneous speed. Only a single moment is needed for him to incinerate a target, the size or location mattering little in the face of his techniques. As a result, often the only way to combat him is to interrupt his alchemy before it starts, either by disrupting his transmutation circles or introducing the element of water. It has also been revealed that Roy is able to delegate each hand to a different flame effect, possibly due to a difference in hand dexterity. The right hand appears to allow for large explosive attacks, while the left allows for smaller, but strong and very accurate pinpoint flame attacks. While Mustang's Flame Alchemy cannot be used on rainy days because the humidity makes it impossible for his gloves to produce sparks, it becomes clear that water itself does not make the Colonel entirely as ""useless"" as his subordinates assume. Using the transmutation circles on his gloves, Roy is able to separate hydrogen atoms from the oxygen atoms in water molecules, isolating them into a highly combustible fuel and powerfully volatile oxidizer, respectively. Though this method can only be used when a large quantity of water is present in a relatively closed-off space , with an outside source of ignition such as a cigarette lighter or a match, Roy can produce extremely powerful, localized explosions. Flame Alchemy is the brainchild of the master alchemistBerthold Hawkeye, who had spent several years perfecting it before his death from illness in 1905. Believing it to be the greatest and most powerful form of alchemy possible, Hawkeye refused to pass on the knowledge to Roy, who was his apprentice at the time, and instead entrusted the secrets of his search for knowledge to his young daughter Riza - tattooing the perfected array onto her back as the only physical record of its existence. The full array appears to consist of a circle corralling an inverted hexagram made up of a large air triangle and a large earth triangle, both splitting into identical pairs as they intersect, with a fire triangle at the center, pointing upward toward a flame. Below the hexagram is an image of a salamander. Outside the circle is a pair of entwined basilisks and the text of the""Libera Me""responsory repeated multiple times. After Roy gains Riza's trust and takes the Flame Alchemy knowledge for himself, he modifies the symbol somewhat for his gloves . At Riza's insistence, he reluctantly uses his new knowledge to burn parts of the image off of her back, erasing the important aspects of it from existence, and freeing her from the heavy responsibility of carrying it. When he is forced to perform human transmutation and see theTruth, Roy gains the ability to transmute without a circle, clapping his hands to compensate for the sigils on his gloves being shredded. While at first he is apprehensive of this mode of alchemy, he quickly realizes that because of the absence of the need for transmutation circles he is no longer limited to flame-based alchemy on the battlefield, as seen when he transmutes a stone wall to protect himself,Riza, and MajorAlex Louis ArmstrongfromFather'sattacks. In theBook in Figure Redomake strip, Roy reveals that he sometimes uses alchemy for the purpose of scoring a date. In his ""Oxygen de Gentleman Strategy"", he uses his gloves to raise the oxygen density around a specific woman to the point that she becomes dizzy. He then rushes to her side to prevent her from falling, asks her if she is all right and follows up with other sweet words and an invitation for tea."

What kind of reinforcement is that on the claws?,diamond tipped,Personality,"""Whoa! What kind of reinforcement is that on the claws? They're not diamond tipped are they?!"": Winry admiringBuccaneer'sModified M1910. Winry is a cheerful, strong-willed, bubbly, hot-headed and empathetic girl who loves everything aboutautomailsand mechanics that she always puts all her heart and effort into her work. She also loves her patients and is always ready to help them. Due to her love and full knowledge about automails,Edward Elricoften calls her a ""engineering otaku"" or a ""crazy gearhead"", while she always calls him ""an otaku alchemist"" in response. Usually, she always hates when Ed broke her automail and often uses her wrench as a weapon, which always makes Ed and Al fear for her rage. Dedicated to her work and her friends, Winry works with almost excessive devotion on the various automail whose maintenance she undertakes for the sake of the people who depend on her, going so far as to take multiple consecutive overnight workshop sessions and travel long distances without hesitation in order to ensure their prompt and proper completion. While she has good intentions, Winry can be stubborn and straightforward, often calling others out for their weaknesses and delusions, but she also offers emotional support to her friends when they need it. She has a strong sense of morality and long respect for her parents, who unfairly died in the war doing the right thing. While at first she tried to killScarafter discovering that he is the killer of her parents, later she decided not to kill him since her parents saved him once, even though she is clear that she will never forgive him. After losing her parents on her childhood, Winry developed a strong attachment to her relatives and also got abandonment issues, always hating being left alone by theElricsand fearing that she could lose them. She also hated to see her two best friends taking the burden of their mistakes on their own. WhenLing Yaosuggests that Alphonse does not need his human body since he is inmortal now, Winry gets mad at his words, to the point of leaving the room, since she knew how Alphonse suffered emotionally for losing his body. She is very compassive, empathetic and sensitive, and often is seeing crying or getting openly emotional towards others, something that she does not have a problem with expressing it, even thought Edward calls her a ""crybaby"" jokingly. Winry also hates putting her friends in danger or awkward situations because of her, getting mad or dissapointed at herself[1]. Due to her cheerful and bubbly attitude, Winry is admired by other people, seeing her as a charming and sweet person, to the point that they seem to get in love with her for a little moment. Winry is also admired by her patients and they prefer when she is the one to attends them instead of Garfield. In many occasions she is seen to be indifferent about the theme of love, being open with her reason to reject Alphonse in her childhood, and also, she is clear an relaxed with the fact that she has romantic feelings for Edward, and is seen teasing him when he awkwardly realizes that he loves her too. Even though, she is seen getting flustered when Edwards confesses to her at the end of the series."

What is Scar's religion?,Ishvalan,Personality,"Scar as he's drawn in the latter half of the manga. Even before the start of the series, Scar has always been defined as a serious, humorless, determined man of few words. A firm believer in the Ishvalan religion, he has always been at odds with the role of alchemy and believes it to be a perversion of nature, which brings him at odds with his older brother. After the incident that gave him his trademark scar and tattoos, Scar became a decidedly brooding, vicious, and angry man, almost totally consumed by hatred towards the people who destroyed his homeland. Knowing full well that his actions go against many of the teachings of his religion, he still fashions himself an agent ofGod'sdivine punishment and takes out his fury onState Alchemists; as a result, he abandons his birth name which Ishvalans consider gifts from God. Unfortunately, this escalates into a monomaniac hatred of State Alchemists, to the point he even targetsEdward Elricwho was never part of the war and is a champion of the people. Notably, he does not seem to have any problem with alchemists that are not part of the military, only fightingAlphonsewhen provoked and showing absolutely no animosity towardsMay Chang. Still, he disagrees with the practice of alchemy as a whole and does not consider himself an alchemist. However, vestiges of his former life's kinder nature are prone to seep through. Even in the middle of his bloody vengeance, Scar is willing to show compassion toward others, honoring last requests and offering his a chance to pray before death. He is reasonably wise and a skilled rhetorician, though his misguided thirst for vengeance clouds his greater judgment and leads his arguments in circles. Having had his people and his family stolen from him, Scar sympathizes with those who care for their loved ones and looks after those who have lost their place in the world. Additionally, he is very protective of his surviving kinsmen and takes all their words of encouragement or chastisement to heart. Over time after his experiences withMilesandWinry, Scar is noticeably calmer and less bloodthirsty, willing to work with others for the greater good. Meeting Miles appears to have given him a new perspective on the relationship Ishvalans and Amestrians can have, desiring not to ""save"" Amestris, but rather to ""change"" it. Although still far from a friendly person, he is able to cooperate with others and is able to be critical of his past self, noting how his rage had once consumed him."
When Scar was investigating the underground tunnels to find the homunculi and learn why they instigated the Ishvalan war?,Dr. Marcoh,Relationships,"Scar's Brother: They loved each other dearly. While Scar and his brother were near opposites and Scar never understood his brother's studies regarding alchemy and alkahestry, he genuinely cared for him. When Kimblee attacks them, Scar's brother shields Scar and later even cuts off his own arm and transmutes it onto Scar to save his life. When Scar realized his brother died, he went on a rampage which ended up killing Winry's parents. He would keep his brother's research notes which would later prove useful in saving Amestris. His death is one of the main reasons for his hatred of Kimblee. May Chang: Being a child and not being a state alchemist, Scar had no vendetta against her. She healed his wound and he allowed her to journey with him. She is one of the few people who didn't see Scar as a monster and in return he respected and tended to protect her. She in turn grew to care for him as a brother, often healing his wounds and remaining attached to him. Dr. Marcoh: The two met while Scar was investigating the underground tunnels to find the homunculi and learn why they instigated the Ishvalan war. Scar happened to be above Marcoh's prison cell and Marcoh revealed he was the alchemist responsible for the Ishvalan massacre. He begs Scar to kill him so the homunculi won't force him to be part of another genocide but Scar spares him to learn more and disfigures him so no one can recognize him. While there is clear animosity from Scar regarding Marcoh and what he has done, he still keeps him alive as his knowledge regarding the homunculi and Scar's brother's research notes was invaluable. While it is possible Scar still doesn't forgive him for what happened, he manages to tolerate his presence. In the 2003 anime however, Marcoh was one of Scar's targets and later attempt to kill him, along with Edward Elric, but Marcoh figured out the symbols on Scar's tattooed right arm, and helped drive him off. Winry: He accidentally killed her parents when he was on a rampage due to the extreme pain of his wounds and trauma from witnessing his brother and fellow countrymen be killed by Kimblee. Scar has shown to have some degree of sympathy in understanding Winry's pain of losing a family, acknowledging that she would be justified in shooting him . His experiences with her are pivotal in his revelation of the cycle of revenge, seeing himself and his brother in her pain experiences. Understandably, in later confrontations the two continue to have a tense relationship. Winry admits that she cannot forgive him for his actions, but the two are able to be cordial with each other, as Winry states that her parents would want her to help him. The two traveled together and although the two didn't interact much, it seemed Scar did grow to regret killing her parents since they did save his life. Mustang: He hated Mustang as he did the many state alchemists who killed his countrymen and on a few occasions tried to murder him. As a result, Mustang did view him as a threat but the two worked together to stop the Homunculi from using Amestris to make a giant Philosopher's Stone. Edward: Simply because of his status as a state alchemist, Scar hunted Ed down to kill him. Edward initially reacted with fear against Scar, but after learning about Scar's role in the murder of Winry's parents and Nina, Ed's emotions quickly turn to anger to bring Scar to justice. After having to work together at the events of Briggs, the two are at least tolerant of each other. Ed is shown to respect Scar's opinions enough to listen to him, but the two still show a strong dislike of each other. Alphonse Elric: Scar is very similar to Alphonse. They both suffered deep trauma and ended having a brother sacrifice an arm to save them. One of the main differences is Scar lost his brother, while Alphonse still has Ed. As such Scar devoted his life to revenge, and after seeing how it consumes him, Alphonse decided not to go down that path. Unusually for Shadow Archetypes they end up bonding with another. In the 2003 anime, this is one of the reasons Scar again has the arm sacrificed, this time to save Alphonse after Kimblee turned Al's body into a bomb. Yoki: Yoki tried turning Scar in to get a reward and be reinstated into the military when they first met. When that failed, he quickly submitted himself to being Scar's servant, which Scar didn't object to. While he tries to play himself off as Scar's master, whenever Scar is in earshot he takes it back and calls Scar master. Scar for the most part seems to simply allow him to travel with him and thinks of him as a nuisance but uses him as a watch-out and to help find a means of transportation. He didn't seem to mind him getting killed when Envy got attached, though he could've been acting as well. Kimblee: Kimblee killed many of Scar's people, including his brother and as a result is the state alchemist he hates more than anyone. Kimblee saw Scar as a survivor and a stain on his reputation since he wouldn't allow any Ishvalans he killed to have survived and the two fought against each other, though it ended in a draw but the matter was not settled as Pride eventually ate Kimblee. In the 2003 anime however, Scar however was the one who killed Kimblee during their battle inReoleafter sacrificing his left arm. Miles: A fellow Ishvalan, he is one of the people who try to convince Scar to give up his life of revenge in order to help reform the Amestrian government to help save their people. Miles does state he will shoot Scar if he continues to evade pursuit but admitted he would hate to have to kill a fellow Ishvalan. Though their interactions are short, the two do reference each other as brothers and by the end of the series work together to help rebuild Ishval. Homunculi: Upon hearing that the homunculi were the ones responsible for destroying his people, he set out to eliminate them. His hatred for them eventually led him to an alliance with Edward and Mustang to help bring them down and save Amestris. In the 2003 anime, he also had a connection to Lust, as she was the created as the result of a failed transmutation by Scar's brother, due to his attempt to bring his deceased girlfriend back to life."

What did Kaneki wear as a child?,"turquoise hoodie, light black pants, running shoes with a yellow toe and blue outlines reaching the middle of the black base of the soles",Appearance,"As a child, Kaneki had all the same features he has now as an adult with black hair. As a normal university student, Kaneki was a somewhat short and scrawny young man with little to no athletic background and preferred to read books. After the steel beam incident, Kaneki bears a scar from the transplant operation on the right side of his abdomen not far from his navel.[15][16]In his free time, he wore casual clothes. His casual outfit consists of a turquoise hoodie, light black pants, running shoes with a yellow toe and blue outlines reaching the middle of the black base of the soles. At work, he wore the standard Anteiku waiter uniform, consisting of black trousers and a gray waistcoat over a white dress shirt and a black necktie . Because he could not yet properly control his singlekakuganthat manifests in his left eye, he wore a medical eye patch to cover it. His ghoulmaskresembles a leather gimp mask with an eye patch. It bears a lipless mouth with large, gnashing teeth, much like a restrained asylum monster. The bolts sticking out of his neck and the fact that he is an artificial ghoul invoke a Frankenstein-like theme. After being tortured byYamori, his appearance changed drastically. His hair became completely white, his nails were blackened, and he developed a more muscular physique. He began to favor monochrome clothing and wore a form-fitting black bodysuit with cutouts when going into battle. His attitude changed as well. He became more cold, and left his innocence behind as he fully embraced his inner ghoul. In the years since adopting the identity of Haise Sasaki, his hair began to develop black streaks growing out from the crown. He wore the standard business attire of a ghoul investigator, favouring black dress shirts and pinstripe pants with a knee-length white trench coat. He also wears a pair of round eyeglasses when reading. After the events of theAuction Mopping-up Operation, his hair slowly began to revert back to its original color with almost no white remaining. After the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation, his appearance changed drastically again. His hair had completely reverted to its original black colour, and he started wearing his glasses in most scenarios. He wore a black version of theArima Squaduniform, pairing a black dress shirt with black slacks and a long, black trench coat. In contrast, he wore a pair of red gloves that disguised his right hand which was covered in reptilian scales. In his second battle with Arima, Sasaki wore a form-fitting black bodysuit underneath his uniform. Upon regaining his identity as Ken Kaneki, his hair turned completely white again after having his limbs cut off repeatedly by Arima. Unable to heal properly from the incident, both of his arms are covered in reptile-like scales. As a result he continues to wear gloves to cover them with black turtleneck shirts with a pair of white pants. Around his neck, he keeps Touka's parents' ring on a chain, and after their marriage, the scar from her bite mark on his right shoulder. For a time, Kaneki wore a collared black coat over his new sleeveless battle suit with dark gloves reaching past his elbows. After becoming immobilized inside Dragon, Kaneki took on the form of a beast big enough to wrap around skyscrapers, with many huge kakugan protruding from large, black limbs. Kaneki was uncontrollable in this state and kept expanding. He had already completely destroyed a large sector of the 23rd ward and presumably completely collapsed the 24th ward. Upon being recovered from dragon by Touka Kirishima and the Q's squad, Kaneki lost much of his muscular mass, and is confirmed to have gained new unidentified organs after his transformation. His entire body from the neck down was covered in kagune-like tissue, along with several black growths running down the front of his upper torso, and his hands possessed three misshapen fingers. His hair was lengthier and hung down below the chin. There appeared to be flesh patterns decorating his neck and lower eyelids. However, upon releasing his new kagune, his body appears to have returned to normal, with his hands once again possessing five fingers and being without the previous scales. Following the six-year timeskip at the end of:re, Kaneki trimmed his hair back to its original length. The flesh patterns under his left eye changed, becoming two thick lines running diagonally from under his left eye all the way down the left side of his face."
What was Kaneki's greatest weakness? (A) His fear of being alone. (B) His fear of being alone. (C) His fear of being alone.,(A),Pre-aogiri,"Kaneki was a shy and reserved person, withHidebeing his only close friend. He usually spent most of his time reading books, mostly novels. He was extremely gentle and appeared to be optimistic most of the time. Influenced by his mother and a true testament of modesty, he willingly took blame and punishment from others so that he can be someone who does not hurt people, but rather absorb the torment. However, this lack of assertiveness normally got him bullied and taken advantage of.[18][19] However, beneath his altruistic and gentle nature was an underlying fear of being alone that was aggravated by his mother's death. He despised the idea of solitude, hence he tried to protect those dear to him so he would not have to face his fear of being alone in the world. This was perhaps his greatest weakness. Since Kaneki was always trying to protect others, he was essentially trying to protect himself from ever being alone again. Therefore, to escape that scenario, he would shoulder the task of protecting others onto himself, without relying on anyone else. This was also why Kaneki rejected the notion of ""living,"" because watching others die reminded him of those lonely days without anyone beside him. After he was turned into a half-ghoul, he clung to his human side. To keep living in the human world, he began to work at Anteiku and established relationships with the ghouls there. He started to develop an interest in becoming stronger and began reading martial art books so he could protect those closest to him. However, he was still troubled with the fact that he was a half-ghoul and wanted to search for a place where he could belong. As much as he treasured his life, if people close to him were threatened, he would not hesitate to put his life on the line."
How did Sasaki feel about his subordinates?,"he was left to worry about their safety. In contrast to before his memory loss, Sasaki rejected his ghoul side and was afraid of it. In contrast to before his memory loss, Sasaki rejected his ghoul side and was afraid of it.",Auction,"The Sasarious While living under his new identity as Haise Sasaki, he was a self-contained and good-natured individual. He was loyal, devoted, and possessed a good work ethic. Sasaki was very cooperative, as he preferred working in a group rather than working alone. He also showed mercy, as he believed that an investigator should not annihilate ghouls unnecessarily. This was sometimes to the chagrin of his fellow ghoul investigators. Sasaki enjoyed reading books in his free time and had a habit of using puns, shown by his conversation with Akira Mado in the curry restaurant. He tended to scratch the back of his head when he was thinking hard or feeling uneasy. He still had his old habit of scratching or rubbing his chin whenever he was hiding something or lying from his days as Kaneki. He showed appropriate respect and great concern for his colleagues, especially his underlings. He complied with orders assigned by his seniors and carried them out without hesitation. However, Sasaki's gentle nature often led his subordinates to constantly disobey him, rendering him ineffective in controlling their actions; he was left to worry about their safety. In contrast to before his memory loss, Sasaki rejected his ghoul side and was afraid of it. When analyzed by Arima after his capture, Sasaki appeared to retain his introverted nature and lack of assertiveness as Kaneki, along with his yearning for a motherly figure. However, Sasaki was still prone to losing control, as shown when he fought the Serpent, where he also cracked his fingers during the fight—a habit that he had originally developed as Kaneki in the past.Donato Porporanoted that Sasaki was curious about his memories but also afraid of them, as he worried he could no longer keep his current life in the CCG should he ever recover his memories. Sasaki feared that relying on his ghoul side would make him disappear. After being rescued from Takizawa by Hinami, Sasaki's perspective on his ghoul nature changed. He concluded that the Kaneki of the past must have been a good person because Hinami cared for him a lot, even though he did not remember. He eventually accepted this ghoul side in order to protect Hinami and Saiko, with the risk of his personality disappearing. He learned about Kaneki, who appeared in his subconscious as a mental construct where ""Kaneki"" admitted that he was also scared and asked Sasaki to not erase him. Sasaki meets his projection of Kaneki, as they accept each other. After the auction, Sasaki was friendlier towards his ghoul side. However, ""Kaneki"" said the relationship could not last forever, as they were two beings fighting for one body. Sasaki was told to ""not erase him"" but misheard it as ""disappear."" He then remained conflicted about his past, actively searching for information about himself."
How did Sasaki feel about Shirazu's death? Available choices: (A). None of the above choices. (B). He felt sad about Shirazu's death. (C). He felt sad about Shirazu's death. (D). He felt sad about Shirazu's death.,(B).,Post-rose extermination,"Kaneki mocking Eto ""You're really just a piece of trash."" During the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation, Sasaki recalled a memory of his past as Ken Kaneki where he had been physically abused by his mother. He also realized that he unconsciously wished to die and had been glad to see Arima during the Owl Suppression Operation. However, that failed, so he believed that burying his past was his salvation, so he chose to forget and live as Haise Sasaki. Upon realizing this, Sasaki accepted his past, resolving to stop ""dreaming."" After regaining his memories, in sharp contrast to his previously gentle personality, Sasaki became colder and much more violent. He fought with more brutal force and was willing to put Tsukiyama's life at risk, despite already remembering his old acquaintance. He did, however, ensure that Kanae would rescue Tsukiyama before throwing the ghoul off the building. He displayed his cold nature to Urie when the latter blamed him for Shirazu's death, calmly telling him that it was his fault as he was the one fighting beside Shirazu. He then mourned together with Mutsuki and Saiko, showing that despite his cold demeanor, he still felt sad about Shirazu's death."
"Who is Kaneki with white hair, Kaneki with black hair, Kaneki with black hair, Kaneki with black hair and no eyepatch (presumably prior to his transformation into a half-ghoul), and Prisoner 240?",Haise Sasaki,Goat wipeout operation,"During his reign as king, Kaneki displays his growing maturity upon taking up the mantle of the ""One Eyed King"". When meeting with the soon-to-be members of Goat, he addresses all of their concerns, even persuading Naki to join him after a brief scuffle. When dealing with the Clown's attack on the CCG, Kaneki shows his ability to direct his forces, doing so in a calm and orderly fashion, while at the same time, selecting members to join him in their attempt to obtain the RC suppressants needed to heal Akira. After Goat was forced to move underground as a result of Furuta's oppressive plan to eradicate the population of ghouls in Tokyo, Kaneki has become more morose. He's more driven and has a tunnel-vision mentality of wanting to protect the ghouls on his lonesome. This comes back to bite him as he returns to the base by himself in an effort to stop Furuta, only to be beaten in a fierce battle by Juuzou and Abara. After this, Kaneki has a conversation with all his past selves; Haise Sasaki, Associate Special Class Haise Sasaki, Kaneki with white hair, Kaneki with black hair, Kaneki with black hair and no eyepatch , and Prisoner 240,"
What is the name of Kaneki's final confrontation with Rize?,Furuta,Dragon arc,"While trapped inside the massive appendage known as the Dragon, Kaneki experienced a mental simulation of himself trapped inside a temple, accompanied by an emulation of Rize. She taunted him for being responsible for the deaths of so many civilians, along with being so responsible for the hunting of so many ghouls. She mocks his idea of trying to get the CCG to cooperate, stating that people keep dying because Kaneki keeps doing things, despite him saying that he's never able to do anything. It became clear that while Kaneki convinced himself that he wanted to live for others, he only wanted to die a beautiful and fulfilled death. He stated that if he kept on fighting, he would feel needed, and yet never considered the death which would come from it. Upon recognizing these flaws, Kaneki states that despite all of the death that he's caused, both directly and indirectly, he'll continue on his path and try to bear the weight of them. When he's released from Dragon, Kaneki is regretful upon seeing the damage that he did to both Tokyo and Hide. Despite this, he remains determined to stop Furuta and save both ghouls and humans. However, after losing to Juuzou and Abara and being shown his flaws by Furuta, Kaneki has decided that he'll do so with the help and support of his friends and family, rather than tackling the issue by himself. During his final confrontation with Rize, Kaneki reflects on his life. He recognizes that everyone is their own protagonist, and that his tragedy doesn't make him anymore special than anyone else. He knows that the world is a harsh and unforgiving place, but despite it all, people will still strive to be loved and chosen by those around them. As a result, he'll carry on and choose and be chosen, nothing more, nothing less."
When does Kaneki enter a limbo-like state where he converses with them?,when he was under extreme duress or near-death,Psychological issues,"Kaneki's mental state undergoes extreme changes over the course of the series. Before his torture, Kaneki would at times refer to his actions as ""we"" or ""us,"" albeit mostly while in a stressed state. Kaneki personifies his feelings to an extent that they take the form of people existing within his mind. When meeting these mental constructs, Kaneki enters a limbo-like state where he converses with them. Kaneki initially only entered this state when he was under extreme duress or near-death and later included during calm settings for conversation. During his torture at the hands of Yamori, this construct takes the form of Rize Kamishiro. She taunts him for his weakness and shows memories from his past with his mother, forcing out his anger towards her for not being able to refuse her sister. Through these memories, she gradually convinces Kaneki to abandon his previous ideology of being the one who gets hurt instead of others. By accepting ""Rize,"" Kaneki embraces a more brutal view of the world and accepts his ghoul powers. The next time he encounters this alternate self is at V14, after being mortally wounded by Arima. Within his mind, he encounters a child version of himself that he feels the desire to protect. As he comes to accept his failings and similarities to his mother, this self transforms into a version of Kaneki as he existed at the beginning of the series. This more innocent Kaneki accepts him and thanks him for all that he has done to protect them. The two vanish together, resolving to ""sleep"" for a while. InTokyo Ghoul:re, the mental construct took on the appearance of Kaneki, initially appearing as Yamori's prisoner while donning his kakuja mask. This ""Kaneki"" torments him, demanding to be accepted and given back his body. Sasaki denied this being, which leads him to moments of instability whenever he uses his ghoul powers. When he is finally forced to accept his past and honor the request to ""look"" at ""Kaneki,"" the projection appears to him as a white-haired child who he feels the need to protect. In the months following, Sasaki and ""Kaneki"" regularly converse with each other. Unlike previous constructs, Sasaki often imagines the child in the real world, picturing the child going through normal activities such as reading. Though they have reached an understanding, the child ""Kaneki"" tells Sasaki that the two of them cannot continue to co-exist and one will eventually vanish. During Sasaki's fight with Karren, a heavily injured Sasaki once again retreats to his mind. The child then confronts him, taunting Sasaki for not being able to protect himself. Sasaki attacks the child, which prompts him to unsuppress his memories of being abused as Kaneki. As these memories came back to him, the child expressed that Kaneki was trying to die during the events at V14. He also desired to be loved by everyone that knows him, regardless of how his actions may obtain the desired result, be them with good or bad intentions, which the mental child Kaneki perceives as salvation. Sasaki regards himself as a ""dream,"" caused when he began to desire. After Sasaki accepted his past, he resolves to quit ""dreaming.""[21] During Sasaki's fight with Arima at Cochlea, the latter savagely beats him to the brink of death. As Sasaki was about to succumb to his injuries and die, his mental construct takes the form of Hide. ""Hide"" scolds him for his selfish excuses, deducing that Sasaki had heard the sound of the compactor and asked whether he was okay with seeing his friends dying and letting his efforts be in vain. ""Hide"" encouraged Sasaki to live, reminding that he sacrificed himself with the goal of ""living together with him"" and that living would allow Sasaki to find a purpose in life.[22]Sasaki's appearance begins to revert back to his post-Aogiri days, with his hair becoming white again. ""Hide's"" advice made Sasaki realize that his mental constructs of ""Rize"" and ""Hide"" were all just manifestations of his inner desires and thoughts. Sasaki believed that Hide would stop him if he went beyond his own boundaries, causing Sasaki to deduce that once he began to think this way, he began to desire to live again. When reduced to only his body and head after being beaten by Juuzou and Abara, Kaneki once again retreats into the inner recesses of his mind. His different personalities convene and discuss what went wrong and what they should've done. Eventually, his many personalities begin to argue and the situation erupts into chaos before they all realize that they have one thing in common; they need to save Touka. Upon this realization, Kaneki asks himself under the guise of his various selves if he's willing to cross the line of killing humans and children. In response, he declares that he will, and that he'll ""press forward, like a centipede"". While Dragon runs rampant throughout Tokyo, Kaneki remains comatose within its recesses. In his mind, he finds himself in a shrine surrounded by an endless ocean. Upon diving in, he finds the bodies of his victims drowning beneath the waves. As he surfaces, he's greeted by ""Rize"", who asks him if he remembers the first time they met. While Kaneki doesn't regret meeting Rize as he's met many friends along the way, ""Rize"" states that she hates him as she'd never be reduced to her current state if she'd never met Kaneki at Anteiku. As he's being pulled out of Dragon, his mental world begins to collapse, and Kaneki leaves declaring that he'll try to bear the weight of his sins."
What is the nickname of Kaneki's best friend?,Hide,Hideyoshi nagachika,"Kaneki's best friend, who he calls by his nickname, Hide, has been Kaneki's closest friend since childhood. Although Kaneki would lack the assertiveness to speak to others, Hide would often speak in his place as his ""voice."" Kaneki is willing to fight for his friend, and Hide is able to perceive Kaneki's emotions. The strong connection between Kaneki and Hide earns Kaneki the capability to refrain from human meat even when driven by ghoul instincts. He cares for Kaneki immensely and did not hesitate to help him even after finding out about Kaneki's transformation into a ghoul. Before his first fight with Arima, Hide encouraged Kaneki to eat him for strength, showing how selfless he can be for his best friend. During his time as Scarecrow, he saved Sasaki's life by activating a microphone which broadcasted Sasaki's near death at the hands of Takizawa, so that aid could be sent to him. Upon revealing himself to the CCG, Hide worked closely with Investigator Marude in order to try and free Kaneki from his Dragon form. After Kaneki was rescued from the body of Dragon, Hide and Kaneki reunited and expressed their thankfulness to each other and remained best friends for the rest of their lives."
How did Kaneki feel about Touka?,She thought of him as a fool for his refusal to eat human meat despite being aware he was formerly human,Touka kirishima,"Initially, the two maintained a neutral relationship between that of waitress and customer until his transformation into a ghoul. Kaneki had at first gone to her for help when his hunger was becoming increasingly worse, but Touka harshly rejected him after he stated he was different from ""monsters"" like her. She refused to show any compassion and beat him up, telling him to go and die on his own. She thought of him as a fool for his refusal to eat human meat despite being aware he was formerly human. When Kaneki joined Anteiku, Touka had little patience for his mistakes and lack of knowledge of ghoul-related affairs, much to his dismay, causing him to think of her as scary. Despite her constant annoyance with him, Touka agreed to teach him more of what living as a ghoul meant. Later, Uta told Kaneki how hard a worker Touka was and he began to think of her as less frightening. The two then found middle ground in their care for Hinami after her mother's death. The event had triggered a desire in Kaneki to become stronger. Thereafter, she agreed to train and instruct him on how to use his kagune, slowly becoming one of the closest people to him. During this time, Kaneki developed his concern for her due to her impulsiveness and a fear that she would die without his knowing. After assisting her in avenging Ryouko's death, their relationship improved and the two began to care for Hinami together. Although Touka maintained her tough attitude towards him, she became friendlier towards him, and often worried for his safety due to his inexperience and on more than one occasion risked her own life to save him. Kaneki in turn viewed her as someone important to him and tried to put her out of harm's way. He responded aggressively to anyone who had hurt her, shown when he broke half of Ayato's bones for hurting Touka and held back from killing him as it would only hurt her more. Upon leaving Anteiku, Kaneki stayed true to his intent to preserve her safety and protect her, shown when he refused to allow her to come with him and avoided her during the months he was away. This caused Touka to often wonder of his whereabouts and wanted to meet him again, as observed by Hinami. Their first reunion when he returned to the 20th ward concluded in an argument and Touka beating him up. Years later as Sasaki, he visited :re and experienced a sense of déjà vu. He subconsciously remembered her, the taste of her coffee had brought him to tears and he thought she was very beautiful. From then, Sasaki developed an infatuation for Touka — he often thought of her and visited :re on multiple occasions. She noted that at the time, he looked at her with the same gaze he looked at Rize with in the past. Nonetheless, Touka believed it was best for Sasaki to not remember who he was, but she agreed that if his memories returned, he was welcome in :re. After regaining his memories, Kaneki met Touka in Cochlea during the Kirishima's fight with Arima. He originally planned to die at the hands of Arima, however he was brought to tears once again when she told him she would see him later, a cruel act in his mind. After the Cochlea raid, Kaneki initially reverted back to his post-Aogiri treatment towards her, continuing his distance from her. After a month, they finally conversed in a friendly manner in :re, though not ending well, they agreed to have the same ideals towards ghouls and humans' interactions. After Goat was formed, he repeatedly excluded her from combat and operations of the organization, much to her disappointment and confusion. Following the Clown Siege, during another private talk, she asked about this and his virginity — causing him some obvious nervousness and discomfort. Together, they discovered their fears of losing the other were mutual. And in the conversation she mentioned the look he gave her as Sasaki, a look that embarrassed Kaneki but one that Touka admitted made her happy, indicating her romantic feelings for him. Afterward, he acknowledged her by asking her to go with him to a Goat meeting. Successfully escaping an ambush, Kaneki and Touka took shelter in an abandoned building and consummated their relationship after a kiss, officially becoming lovers. As a memento of her, he received her parent's ring, one that served as a source of strength for her during difficult times. Realizing he truly loved Touka the two became more and more intimate. Kaneki then asked her to marry him in a ghoul ceremony after she revealed she was pregnant with his child. After being dismembered by Suzuya and Hanbee and cornered by the Oggai, Kaneki started to hallucinate — the multiple personalities of him clashing over the various choices that caused his defeat and he was close to completely giving up. However, when one of them pointed out that they would never see Touka again, all of them came into an agreement to continue to fight for survival in order to see her again, showing how important Touka had become in Kaneki's mind. Touka, after Kaneki's position in the Dragon was revealed, risked her life by clawing into the surface of Dragon, and after an intense struggle, recovered him from Dragon's body. The two embraced after Kaneki awoke in a hospital. During the epilogue, both happily continue their marriage, taking care of their daughter Ichika, with another child on the way."
How does Kaneki feel about Tsukiyama after escaping from the Aogiri hideout?,"He accepts him into his group, believing that Tsukiyama would make for a powerful ally. His advanced strength makes him stronger than Tsukiyama, so he uses that to threaten him into knowing his place. After Tsukiyama's plot is exposed, he feels betrayed by him and becomes wary of him. After escaping from the Aogiri hideout, Kaneki accepts him into his group, believing that Tsukiyama would make for a powerful ally. His advanced strength makes him stronger than Tsukiyama, so he uses that to threaten him into knowing his place. He is still aware that Tsukiyama wishes to eat him even if he tries to hide it, but Kaneki never shows concern for his own safety, trusting that his strength will intimidate Tsukiyama and keep him in check.",Shuu tsukiyama,"When they meet at Anteiku, Kaneki's first impression of Tsukiyama is that he looks like a model. Even though the others try to convince him that Tsukiyama is bad news, Kaneki still thinks that he seems like a person who he can trust. He goes along with him to have coffee, then plays a game of squash with him without realizing that Tsukiyama is priming him as a meal. After Tsukiyama's plot is exposed, he feels betrayed by him and becomes wary of him. After escaping from the Aogiri hideout, Kaneki accepts him into his group, believing that Tsukiyama would make for a powerful ally. His advanced strength makes him stronger than Tsukiyama, so he uses that to threaten him into knowing his place. He is still aware that Tsukiyama wishes to eat him even if he tries to hide it, but Kaneki never shows concern for his own safety, trusting that his strength will intimidate Tsukiyama and keep him in check. In order to prepare himself for upcoming confrontations, he asks Tsukiyama to help him train and develops a tentatively friendly relationship with him, though he is always careful to maintain his distance. He would later see Tsukiyama as a friend, recognizing the latter's attempt to kill him during the Owl Suppression Operation was Tsukiyama trying to protect him. In:reas Haise, he meets Tsukiyama in a fragile and sickly state, as he has starved and isolated himself after Kaneki's disappearance. He does not remember him, although meeting him a few times. Later he asks Tsukiyama to tell him everything about his past as he could not stand avoiding ""fate"" anymore, having figured that he was one of Kaneki's friends. During the Tsukiyama Operation, he was reluctant to fight Tsukiyama and hesitated killing him when his inner ""Kaneki"" repeatedly yells at him not to do it. Shortly after his reawakening, he stabs Tsukiyama in the chest, in order for him to appear seriously wounded and in danger of dying. When Ui arrives at the scene, he decides to give Shuu a chance to escape or die by hurling him off the building, glancing at Kanae in order for her to go save him. Through this, it can be assumed he still holds some regard for Tsukiyama as an individual, but not enough as to actually care about what happens to him ultimately. It is implied further by Chie Hori that Kaneki does seem to still care about him, as she stated that if he really wanted to kill Tsukiyama, he would have done it already. When Kaneki defects from the CCG and forms Goat, Tsukiyama joins him at his side as his best friend and right-hand man. Tsukiyama is both the financial benefactor of Goat as well as one of Kaneki's most trusted advisors. He was responsible for helping Goat defend Tokyo from the Clowns as well as providing the materials necessary to rescue Kaneki from Dragon. He was one of the only individuals who cared about Kaneki's happiness in the vast organization of Goat, him bringing up how unhappy Kaneki must have been as Dragon, as he was unable to read, enjoy coffee, or hold his child in that state."
What does Sasaki do after Hinami's capture?,shows her the same kindness he did in the past by bringing her books and asking about her condition,Hinami fueguchi,"Hinami looks up to Kaneki as a big brother. She is aware and interested in his half-human nature as she had few or no interactions with human society. They both share a passion for reading, especiallySen Takatsuki's works, and he often tutors her in new vocabulary to learn. After her mother's death, both Touka and Kaneki have been very protective of her and treat each other like family. Alongside Banjou and Tsukiyama, she joinsKaneki's groupof ghouls. While he often goes on his missions, he still manages to smile and be there for her when he is around, even accompanying her to places such as Sen Takatsuki's book signing. As Sasaki, he showed concern for Hinami's safety when he learned she was acquainted with his past, and he asked her to leave while she was protecting him to prevent her from being hurt any further byTakizawa. Haise also managed to convince Arima to let her be taken captive instead of eliminated on the spot, showing that he still cares for Hinami. After her capture, he shows her the same kindness he did in the past by bringing her books and asking about her condition. While he tells her that he is not the same man she knew in the past, he admits to himself that he is growing attached to her, which troubles him greatly. After the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation, Sasaki seems to have become distant towards Hinami as he has not visited nor talked to her during the six months since the end of the operation. This leaves Hinami in a depressed state as her execution is coming close.[23]However, this was a ruse as later he betrays the CCG in order to save her.[24]"
How did Kaneki feel about Rize?,he was attracted to him because of his delicious appearance and himself,Rize kamishiro,"Rize was attracted to Kaneki because of his delicious appearance and himself. Both of them shared many interests. After their date, Rize tried to hunt him down, but failed. At the end, she supposedly died and he, heavily injured, was taken to a hospital, whereDr. Kanoudecided to transplant her organs into him. In Kaneki's mind, during his time locked in Yamori's hobby room, she appeared before him. They had a sensitive conversation about his past and personality.[19]He attributes her to his ghoul side, as she was the cause of him. Although she was a figment of Kaneki's imagination, she supported him and strengthened his resolve. A hallucination of Rize appears to Kaneki earlier in the anime, representing the subconsciousness of Kaneki's ghoul half. She usually haunts Kaneki when he is hungry and needs to eat human meat. Kaneki was shocked to learn Rize was still alive in Kanou's lab as an experiment during the lab raid. Later, while contemplating his previous ideals, he visits Rize in Yomo's place. Seeing the once strong ghoul in a starving weakened state made him question his own motives for gaining more power. The two met again during Kaneki's fight withNimura Furuta, as the latter called her ""his precious dragon"". After Kaneki defeated Furuta, he climbed the body of the Dragon until he reached its core, fighting off huge mouthed kagune with hair that resembles Rize's. It's revealed that Rize has somehow merged with the Dragon, and appears in front of him with white hair. With a tear rolling down his cheek, Kaneki kills Rize to end the Dragon's rampage."
Who does Sasaki call a brat and swears to teach him a lesson?,Urie,Kuki urie,"During Urie's time as the squad leader, their professional and personal relationship is tense, as Urie is prone to challenging Sasaki's leadership on all fronts. He frequently acts on his own without bothering to consult the rest of the team, leaving Sasaki in the dark about things and deeply frustrated as a result. When the team becomes fractured as a result of Urie's manipulation, Sasaki calls him a brat and swears to teach him a lesson. Even so, he acknowledges that his troublesome subordinate is highly-skilled with exceptional intuition. That he refuses to cooperate with others, and so frequently criticizes him in front of others, is a great source of frustration for Sasaki. After the Auction Raid, their relationship seems to have improved. Urie shows more trust in Sasaki's decisions and even comes to him to train. However, during the Tsukiyama Operation, he was about to tell him off for not being there for Shirazu, only for Sasaki to immediately lash out and turn the blame on him for not being strong enough. Even after he left the Q-squad, Sasaki still cares for Urie as the latter was the only one he met and personally requests him to save Mutsuki, while showing a kind smile. It is also noted that Urie was the only one of the first Q-squad who Sasaki conversed with before defecting from the CCG. When Kaneki was trapped within Dragon, Urie was among those who were responsible for digging him out of Dragon's body. Later, when Kaneki asks to see the havoc he's wrought, Urie volunteers to accompany him under the pretense of making sure he doesn't go on another rampage. As they are walking, Urie and Kaneki openly talk to one another, signifying that there's no bad blood between them. When they are cornered by some of Dragon's golems, Urie is the first to offer himself as a decoy while Kaneki and Saiko retreat."
What did Kaneki inherit after inheriting Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou? Select from the following. (A) None of the above choices. (B) Kaneki inherits Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou. (C) Kaneki inherits Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou. (D) Kaneki inherits Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou.,(B),Powers and abilities,"Ghoul Physiology: After inheriting Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou, Kaneki has displayed a unique healing factor, as well as a rinkakukaguneconsisting of tentacles and increased physical power. Due to the hybrid vigor, Kaneki's abilities are said to be more potent than those of a natural-born ghoul. Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Kaneki is extremely skilled in close combat. With his four-tailed Kagune, he can easily match Yamori's attacks but soon overpowers them. This is also proven when Kaneki twists and breaks his own left leg after Yamori grabbed it to land a hard right knee strike from his right leg to knock him back. As Haise Sasaki, he was able to fight the entire Quinx squad with the exception of Urie at once during a sparring session, and later during a sparring session with Urie he proved to be heavily superior. Swordsmanship: Using his quinque, Sasaki has been described to have movements as swift as water, being able slice through a ghoul's kagune and also use it efficiently with his own kagune.[12][43]He was also able to keep up with Kichimura Washuu at the end of the dragon arc through the use of a quinque formed from his Kagune. Keen Intellect: When facing adversaries, Kaneki often used his intellect and careful planning to quickly and efficiently take out his foe. Kaneki comprehends Takatsuki's in-depth work, and also understands martial arts moves and styles just by reading about them in a book, to the point where he is able to implement them in his fights not long afterwards."
What color is Kaneki's kagune?,bright red,Kagune,"Rinkaku Kagune: Kaneki's kagune is portrayed in the anime as bright red, becoming a darker shade as it neared the tips. In theTokyo Ghoul:reanime, it has changed to a red-violet color. Kaneki initially displayed his kagune in his fight against Nishiki Nishio, possessing three tails which repeatedly impaled Nishiki before throwing him, saving him and Hide while having little control over them.[44]After his torture, Kaneki was able to produce four tentacles in his battle with Yamori, which were capable of pinning down and overwhelming an incomplete kakuja.[44]During the raid on Kanou's lab, Kaneki's kagune further developed into six tentacles, albeit in an unstable mental state,[14]and while he fought Kishou Arima, Kaneki was able to manifest eight tentacles which are able to be shaped into small hands, which have an enormous range and destructive force enough to damage V14's pillars.[32]As Haise Sasaki, he is able to control and manipulate the shape of his kagune at will, and command the tentacles to process different tasks at once.[12]He is also noted to have a better control over his kagune than natural-born ghouls.[45]In his fight with Karren von Rosewald and Eto Yoshimura, Sasaki was able to shape his kagune into more intricate forms,[33]and his kagune is greatly larger, with the potency of neutralizing Owl's kakuja.[40]After devouring Eto's kakuja, his kagune is able to form multiple eyes and mouths. Even while exhausted, he was able to manifest it fast enough that Hajime and the rest of the Oggai could not react, and was able to quickly devastate the vast majority of them. By the time of his final confrontation with Furuta, Kaneki's kagune had grown to a massive size, it's thickness dwarfing that of a human being, in addition to it's length growing as well."

How old is Touka Kirishima?,a second-year student at Kiyomi High Schooland later a third-year after the post-Aogiri timeskip,Film actor,"""What the hell do you know?! It's all because I can't eat, because I could be a target at any time, all because I'm a ghoul! No matter how much I try, there's a wall I can never jump over, and there's happiness that I can never have. But I'm still hanging on to life. Despite it all.""— Touka Kirishima,Tokyo Ghoul: DaysChapter 2 Touka Kirishima is aghoulwho is an ex-waitress atAnteiku. She is the daughter ofArata KirishimaandHikari Kirishima, the older sister ofAyato Kirishima, the wife ofKen Kanekiand the mother ofIchika Kaneki. Touka wears a rabbit mask while hunting, earning her the aliasRabbit. InTokyo Ghoul, she was a second-year student atKiyomi High Schooland later a third-year after the post-Aogiri timeskip. Two years after theOwl Suppression Operation, she returns as theManager of the coffee shop:re. Following its destruction she joins the newly formed organizationGoat, thus relocating to the24th wardalong with its other members. After theDefense of Tokyo, Kaneki and Touka currently live happily married with adaughterand another child coming, with humans and ghouls finally united together."
What is the name of Touka's high school uniform?,waitress,Appearance,"Touka is a slender teenage girl with bob-length dark blue hair that has long bangs that reach her chin covering the right side of her face and blue eyes. She appears to be a cute, normal girl that one would not suspect to be a ghoul. Her facial features and hairstyle bear a strong resemblance toHikari Kirishima andAyato Kirishima. She wears her waitress or high school uniform for work and school respectively, whereas her casual clothes are tomboyish streetwear. Her waitress uniform is a white shirt rolled up to her elbows, a black vest, a red tie, and a black skirt down to her lower thighs. On top of that skirt, she also wears a brown skirt that reaches her upper thighs. She also wears tight red leggings. As ""Rabbit"", she wears a long coat jacket, rabbitmask, and a blonde, or sometimes a pink, wig to conceal her identity. After the Aogiri arc, her hair reaches her shoulders, but her signature bangs remain the same. As a child, she wore dresses and bunny hair-clip on the left side of her bangs, and her hairstyle was much the same. However, her bangs at first were brushed to the side revealing her whole face. After the timeskip, Touka became a beautiful woman that many characters includingKen Kanekihave been left speechless by her attractive appearance. During a negotiation between the CCG and Goat, a ghoul investigator was stunned by Touka’s beauty. She has reverted back to her short bob cut. Her bangs are shorter as it reaches her nose instead of her chin and it is considerably bouncier than her previous bob haircut, in addition, she has dyed her hair a much lighter shade of blue. Touka switched to a more feminine style of clothing. She wears a white wide neck blouse with a black apron over the top for her waitress outfit. When Touka's moving around as a ""ghoul"", she wears a trench coat, pants and boots. After the Clown Siege, Touka dyed her hair back to its original dark blue color."
What is Touka's father's name?,Ken Kaneki,Personality,"Touka's personality is initially defined by her duality between rage and kindness, with her character arc centred around that rage fading as well as her kindness coming to the fore. She is inherently kind, but this was repressed due to her losing her father and thus having to survive in the ghoul world from an early age, which required her to be ruthless. AsShuu Tsukiyamanotes, she had previously looked more dangerous and cold but has somewhat softened up because of her human life, and continued to do so due toKen Kaneki's influence, who allowed her to be the kind person she is deep down. She is also rash and reckless mainly due to her abandonment issues, causing her to lose control of her emotions when losing someone close to her, and her insecurities over her ghoulhood, given the dangers associated over simply existing as a ghoul, as well as the necessity to eat humans to survive. She longs to be human and desires to integrate into their society, as shown by her strong connection with the human world. This comes from her father, who taught her to reject her ghoulhood and to live with humans in order to survive, as well as a desire to simply live happily and in peace with her loved ones. She hates her ghoulhood and has low esteem as a result, as shown by her reaction when called beautiful byKimi Nishino, despite seeing her as a ghoul with a kagune. However these insecurities also cause her to lash out at the world when there's injustice done towards ghouls, particularly when it's done to ghouls close to her. This low self esteem is further diminished due to her abandonment issues, saying herself she felt ""useless"" for being unable to stop her father from getting killed, which she viewed as him prioritizing revenge for her mother over taking care of her andAyato Kirishima. These issues become worse when Ayato and then Kaneki abandon her, creating and reinforcing a mentality that she's not good enough for the people she loves to stay with her. This low self esteem as well as her abandonment issues results her willing to recklessly throw her life away multiple times before the timeskip, such as during the Anteiku Raid, when she cannot bear the pain of losing someone close to her. Due to her fathers teachings she attempts to conform to the world, having been compared to a bird trapped in a cage within the story itself, but she also cannot accept injustice done towards ghouls due to her insecurities, nor can she bear the pain of losing someone close to her due to her abandonment issues, and lashes out when she cannot suppress this anger, such as during the Doves Emergence arc. She is full of hatred forghoul investigators, stemming from the fact that her family was torn apart by theCCGand she had to live life as a fugitive. This hatred and rage subsides over time, especially after she killsKureo Madoout of revenge, realizing he was married afterwards. This lead to her realizing she was only contributing to the cycle of hate and revenge, having likely inflicted the same trauma on someone as the ghoul investigators did on her. After the timeskip, Touka is more openly gentle and warm, following on from her development from before. She has matured during this time, as a consequence of the Anteiku Raid. This can be seen by her being able to better accept loss, due toRenji Yomoteaching her before the timeskip to live while losing things. After continually experiencing loss she adopts a more healthy ""live while losing"" mentality, in order to come to terms with such a harsh and dangerous world for ghouls, which results in her being far less reckless. She is also less confrontational, having lost Kaneki for years following their confrontation and her losing control of her emotions in the way that she did, which she later regretted. This has also lead to her being more repressive of her emotions, in order to process potential losses in a healthier way, as evident in the 24th Ward where she had to ignoreYoriko Kuroiwa's execution letter, as well the potential deaths of Yomo andHinami Fueguchi. She has also become accepting of the fact that she loves Kaneki, unlike before where she denies it in embarrassment, which led to her being happy when he gave her the look he used to giveRize Kamishiroand over time after Kaneki regained his memories and lead Goat, she became outright bold and openly professed her feelings for him by revealing how she felt over him isolating her and even going as far as to ask if he was a virgin and in fact even noting she wants to do the deed with him, with her indeed making the move that caused them to consummate their relationship and showing an openly soft and tender side with him. It is her relationship and marriage to Kaneki that provides her with the happiness she always yearned for and helped show that her belief that she wasn't good enough for her loved ones to stay and confide in her was wrong."
How did Kaneki react to Touka's attitude towards Kaneki?,"She treated him in a more friendly manner, though she maintains her rough attitude",Ken kaneki,"Touka initially had a neutral relationship with Kaneki being that of waitress and customer until he transformed into a ghoul. Touka was confused to see a half-ghoul and became hateful to Kaneki, especially after he stated that he is different from ""monsters"" like her and other ghouls. She refused to show any compassion to him as he is a former human. During his early days at Anteiku, Touka would often boss him around and chide him for the slightest mistakes. She considered many of the things he did irritating and bothersome. However, she still agrees to train Kaneki when he wants to become stronger and learn how to use his kagune. After he helps her avenge Ryouko, Touka's attitude towards Kaneki improves and she treats him in a more friendly manner, though she maintains her rough attitude. Touka is one of the closest people to Kaneki in Anteiku, helping him adapt to ghoul life. According to herself, she had fell for Kaneki when he confessed he would be sad if she died. She often worried for his safety due to his inexperience in the ghoul world and in more than one occasion risked her own life to save him. After Kaneki's rescue and departure from Anteiku, which Touka was willing to follow him into, even giving up her collageship just for him, only to be rejected by Kaneki, which caused her to run away in dismay, Touka would often wonder of his whereabouts and wanted to meet him again. However, she hated the person he had become after the torture and when they finally met, Touka found Kaneki's reasons to be inadequate and violently lashed out, yelling at and beating Kaneki and even saying he should never return to Anteiku before leaving him beaten on the ground after questioning why he became so different, which left Kaneki remorseful and with the realization what he was doing was wrong. She felt regret over this and this intensified after Kaneki was declared dead, crying, but she still believed he was alive. She later met Kaneki as he visits :re as Sasaki and she identified him. He seems to somewhat remember her, as he tears up when he smells her coffee and thinks it reminds him of someone and he developed an infatuation for Touka, often visiting and looking at her the same way he did with Rize, showing romantic interest, which Touka recognized and made her happy due to how it was a sign of Kaneki returning her feelings. Nevertheless, she appeared to be resigned to the fact that at that point, they couldn't be together as Kaneki was now a Ghoul Investigator and put her feelings aside in favor for him being happy in his new life, which made her reject Tsukiyama's desire to make Kaneki regain his memories, as she believed it would be best if Sasaki does not remember who he was, but she agreed that if his memories come back, he would be welcome in :re. Touka later met Kaneki after he fully regained his memories in Cochlea when he shields them from Arima's onslaught and, knowing Kaneki may intend to ""die"" again, inspired him to leave, sadly smiling and asking to see him later, which he deemed a cruel thing to the point of crying. They converse in a friendly manner in :re after the Third Cochlea Raid, before smacking Kaneki onto the tabletop counter. Later, in a private conversation with him, Touka asks if he is a virgin and in the anime, even says she wouldn't mind doing the deed with him, much to his embarrassment. She reveals how she feels; how their roles have been reversed and that Kaneki repeatedly leaves her out of danger, the first time being four years ago when he left Anteiku. She then told him that he often visited :re as Sasaki and looked at her the same way he used to look at Rize. She confesses that she liked it, thus finally admitting to her romantic feelings for him. After escaping from the ambush byMutsuki,Auraand one of theOggai Squads, Touka and Kaneki take shelter in an abandoned building and when Kaneki couldn't offer any comfort to her on Yoriko and asked they sleep instead, Touka pins down Kaneki and kisses him, which results in them both consummating their relationship and officially becoming lovers, which results in her becoming pregnant with his child. She gives Kaneki Hikari's wedding band, which she says has been a source of strength for her during difficult times, as a memento of her. As they become more and more intimate, Touka eventually revealed her pregnancy and Kaneki asked her to marry him, which she accepted. When Kaneki seemingly died upon the emergence of the Dragon, Touka displayed how important he has become to her by displaying an uncharacteristic breakdown when desperately trying to save him. She was first left distraught, solemnly lamenting the apparent loss of Kaneki, and frustrated by GOAT's belief that they should let Kaneki rampage, to soon being driven to tears when reminded of their unborn child but gathered the strength to say that she needs to find Kaneki and get him to name their child. Touka was even willing to work with CCG to get Kaneki back and openly acknowledged their marital status by saying her husband was waiting for her when Mitsuki attacked her. She was left frantic when she saw his ring on a severed limb and frantically dug through Dragon while risking self-harm until she finally found him but was left concerned with how difficult it was to treat Kaneki and continued to force herself to stay awake when Kaneki was unconscious. After he woke up, she cried tears of relief and immediately hugged him. When Kaneki went to stop Dragon, Touka only reluctantly let him go and was left deeply concerned to the point of being unable to sleep. After everything is finally over, Touka and Kaneki continue their marriage, with Touka starting a new coffee shop while she and her husband Kaneki take care of their daughter Ichika together."
How did Touka feel when he turned against his only family?,emotional hurt,Ayato kirishima,"As the last surviving member of her family, Touka is responsible for her younger sibling's well being. After Arata went missing she took the burden of raising him in order to follow in her father's footsteps. However, Ayato is devastated and bitter towards humans for how their prejudice against ghouls had torn apart his family. In turn, he has taken a different stance from his father and sister's view on them. Prior to his separation from Touka, he was her constant companion, they would hunt together and fight as a team. That is before he began to act on his own and go where he pleased without her, causing her to incessantly worry about him. Whether something would happen to him or why he was keeping himself separated from her, both bothered her.[4]Following her enrollment into school, he left and Touka would receive word about his rampages in other wards, affecting her deeply and developed her fear of losing those she loves. However, she believed her own character and mistakes were what drove him away.[3] While he disagrees with her ideas on humanity, he still cares for her safety even despite joining Aogiri shown when he refused to let Yamori and Nico to take her as well as Kaneki. Remembering the emotional hurt Touka felt when he turned against his only family, during their first reunion she was anger at him, both with opposite views and what the right thing was. When they reunite again in:reduring the Third Cochlea Raid, Touka supports Ayato in his fight against Arima and tells him to rely on her more instead of trying to handle everything himself.[5][6]"
How many years after Anteiku's destruction did they open another cafe called :re?,two,Renji yomo,"Before Touka's employment at Anteiku, Yomo would clean up her and Ayato's messy kills to prevent the CCG from tracking down the two of them. When seeing each other during this time they were silent.[4]However this changed after joining Anteiku, the two formed a good relationship as they worked, unknown to her and Ayato, Yomo is her maternal uncle, the younger brother to their mother, Hikari. In the past, he trained her in combat and knows the majority of her strengths, noticing instantly that she was not in the best condition when they trained along with Kaneki, since she was eating human food prepared by Yoriko. Together, they would be the ones restocking the ""food"" that Anteiku would offer to the ghouls who were unable to hunt. He speaks to Touka honestly, and did not sugar-coat his words when she attempted to join the others during the Owl Suppression Operation. InTokyo Ghoul:re, two years after Anteiku's destruction, posing as brother and sister, they opened another cafe called :re."

This made her mentally unstable and unable to recognize her surroundings. Kaneki eventually found her in this state, which prompted him to reevaluate his decisions.[15] During theOwl Suppression Operation, Rize appeared as another hallucination to Kaneki in the sewers, but unlike before where she was coherent and humanized, she became a deformed and monstrous entity who tried to eat him.[16] At some unknown time, Rize's foster fatherShachivisitedNishiki NishioandRenji Yomo, who had been taking care of Rize per his agreement with Yoshimura.

How did Ayato feel about his father?,"bore deep grudges against his father, Arata, for abandoning him and Touka when they were young",Personality,"Ayato was an arrogant, brash teenager, with a similar hot-blooded attitude resembling his sister's, while he normally displayed either a scowl or menacing smirk on his face. Other than his physicalities, he shared many similarities with Touka, such as his tendency to use language that is often uncouth or inappropriate. He had a habit for kicking people over the simplest mistakes; such as when Kaneki failed to address him with the desired honorific, or when Banjou did not return his missed calls. However, he seemed to be more harsh compared to his sister, but admitted himself to be surprisingly ""softer"" than his Aogiri superiors. He was a firm believer in the notion that ""the weak perish and the strong survive,"" which was triggered by the death of his mother and father. Ayato bore deep grudges against his father, Arata, for abandoning him and Touka when they were young. Ayato had even stated that the whole reason for hating Kaneki was his resemblance to Arata. It was also pointed out by Kaneki that Ayato cared deeply for Touka subconsciously, as shown when he beat her down first rather than allowing her to suffer a slow, torturous death from Yamori. Later on, he also took her alias, ""Rabbit"" so the CCG would hunt him instead of Touka. Ayato also seemed to have a soft spot for rabbits. Three years later, there was a reduction in most of the mannerisms and habits which Ayato once portrayed when he was younger; as he became far less ill-tempered, obnoxious and arrogant, and even developed a rational, approachable way of speaking. Ayato also grew on having a sense of concern, as well as the instinct to protect his subordinates, shown when he refused to leave Hinami behind in the auction and by not following Tatara's orders and going to back up Naki when he was outnumbered by theDoves. However, he still retained a few of his old traits, such as relentlessly slaughtering ghoul investigators and engaging in violent brawls. He tends to hide his softer side, by denying he wanted to visit hisniece."
What did Touka and Ayato do after visiting a woman named Satouto tell her of their father's disappearance?,They managed to escape as Touka used herkaguneto kill the investigators,Background,"Ayato and his sister, Touka, as children. Ayato resided in the20th wardwith his sister Touka, under the care of their father,Arata Kirishima. Arata lived his life like humans did; he usually took Ayato and Touka to the library to study, and even convinced them to eat food offered by humans; for he believed that ghouls should try to blend in with human society by adapting their behavioral patterns. Ayato however, supposed that it was solely a human’s world, and that ghouls were not “normal.” He and Touka also cared for abird, where Ayato was shown to dislike earthworms and insects. One night before Arata set out on his regular scavenging routine, Ayato made a promise to him that he would protect Touka whenever she was in trouble. After Arata never returned, Ayato assumed that his father had died byghoul investigatorsfinding and killing him. Touka and Ayato visited a woman namedSatouto tell her of their father’s disappearance. She offered them human food, but when they refused, Satou stuffed the food in Ayato’s mouth, and both siblings were sold out. They managed to escape as Touka used herkaguneto kill the investigators.[3] Ayato claiming a feeding ground. Ayato’s perspective of humans changed immediately; as he came to the conclusion that none of what they went through would have happened if they had not gotten involved with humans. After running away from home, they foundAnteiku, where they were taken care of byYoshimura. As they grew up, the siblings got stronger, to the point where Ayato started displaying violent tendencies. When Touka started school and metYoriko, Ayato told her that interacting with humans was foolish; for they could not be trusted under any circumstance. Believing they might end up just like Arata did, Ayato left Anteiku in search of more power. He then wandered the wards of Tokyo, such as the14th ward; where he took away multiple feeding grounds from the ghouls there.[3]"
Where did Ayato barge into Anteiku?,Aogiri Hideout,Aogiri arc,"Ayato barges into Anteiku. Ayato was first seen at the Aogiri Hideout in the11th ward, enraged by the fact that he sentKazuichi Banjouon a mission to captureRize Kamishiro, but Banjou did not answer his phone calls. Ayato, thinkingYakumo OomoriandNicowould capture Rize before him, decided to go visit the20th ward. He briefly talks about a little of his history there to an unnamed Aogiri member.[4] Ayato barged intoAnteikuupon hearing Banjou tellingKen Kanekito tell Rize should run away from the incoming danger. He kicked Banjou in the arm, cracking his bones, and threatened to give him another beating. Ayato was suddenly faced with his elder sisterTouka Kirishima, and when asked where he wandered off to after walking out of her life, Ayato said he had been ""studying the world,"" for he would never proclaim himself to be a ""peaceful idiot."" Ayato became disappointed when he saw Yamori at Anteiku as well, but when Nico pointed out that Kaneki was indeed the one who smelled like Rize, Ayato cooperated with Yamori to capture Kaneki.[5] When Touka put up a resistance by not wanting them to take Kaneki, she countered Yamori but was confronted by Ayato. Ayato, punching her in the face, compared Touka to their dead parents, calling her a ""weakling."" Touka thrusted her kagune at him, but he blocked the attack with one of his wings. With his own kagune activated, Ayato pledged to show her ghouls were truly above humans. Ayato then beat her down effortlessly, subsequently ordered Banjou to stuff an unconscious Kaneki in a bag, and headed back to the 11th ward. When asked if they should take Touka as well, Ayato desisted, saying she would just weigh them down.[6] At the hideout, Ayato was the first person to approach Kaneki when he woke up. He ordered Kaneki to follow him, but when Kaneki showed concern for Touka’s well-being, Ayato kicked him, telling him he was not allowed to talk, and should be obedient of the slightest order he was given. Ayato then admitted himself to be a ""softy,"" in comparison to his superiors. He then took Kaneki to a meeting to meet Tatara, but when Tatara refused Kaneki, Ayato was told to do what he wanted with him. So Ayato locked Kaneki away in a room.[7] Later on, during the CCG’s raid on the Aogiri base, he was beside theBin brothers, battling the ghoul investigators.[8] Ayato feasts upon Touka's kagune. After some while, he encountered Touka, assuming she came to the Aogiri Hideout to save Kaneki. He told Touka that Kaneki was originally made into one of his subordinates, but was now with Yamori. Ayato pronounced Kaneki dead; due toYamori's torture hobby and violent sadistic tendencies. Angry, Touka charged toward him, but he blocked her attack by clutching her foot in his palm.[9]He then threw her to the ground, deciding to take her to the above platform once she fell unconscious. Once they arrived there, he bludgeoned Touka once more, subsequently feasting off of herkagune. Ayato pointed out that Touka, just like their father, was weak, and that the superiority or inferiority of any individual was solely dependent upon “power.”[10] Kaneki starts breaking 103 of Ayato's bones. When Kaneki rescued Touka, Ayato confronted him on the roof of the hideout. Ayato declared that Kaneki should die and started shooting bullets with his kagune, all of which Kaneki dodged. He became irritated as Kaneki vowed to ""half-kill"" him for his actions.[11]The two battled, and Kaneki lectured him for being violent against his own sibling, and pierced Ayato’s thigh with his kagune afterwards. Ayato engaged Kaneki in close combat, but Kaneki effortlessly beat him down. He was agitated at the fact that Kaneki pointed out his ""secret.""[12]Kaneki openly told him the person Ayato portrayed himself to be was the total opposite of what was in his heart. The reason why Ayato had even joinedAogiri Treein the first place was to become strong enough to ensure Touka would not be killed, and hence he protected her. Ayato denied this, mentioning that he hated Kaneki since he first met him, for Kaneki reminded Ayato of his father,Arata Kirishima. Ayato was weakened when Kaneki gave him another beating, and was forced to endure as Kaneki calmly broke one hundred three of the two hundred six bones of his body.[13]"
What weapon did Ayato use to defeat the SWAT members?,thekakujaarmor,√a (anime),"Ayato partnered with Kaneki. After Kaneki joined Aogiri, he and Ayato were partnered to do missions together. They were first sent to destroy a convoy containing a mass of CCG vehicles, one of which an arrestedNakiwas believed to be in. Ayato was puzzled whenNashiroandKuronaappeared. He ordered the Aogiri members to retrieve Naki from an ablaze car and seeing the latter’s childish behavior over Yamori’s death, caused Ayato to become irritated. Ayato vs Shinohara. Whilst infiltratingCochleato findShachi, Kaneki prevented a barrier from closing in, allowing Ayato to descend through the crevice and target the tactical guard members of the CCG. He later ran intoYukinori Shinoharaand the two clashed. Ayato sensed a strange presence in the room, and after seeing Shinohara activate thekakujaarmor,Arata, made from his father, Ayato finally reached the conclusion of his father’s whereabouts. Ayato later succumbed to an overwhelming attack from Shinohara. Weakened, he tried to muster up the strength to strike against the Arata armor, but failed to do so when memories of his father resurfaced. He then collapsed, but before Shinohara could deal him the final blow, Ayato was saved by Kaneki. During the CCG's ultimate operation of ghoul eradication, Ayato was tackling the SWAT members with his underlings."

As they were about to infiltrate the compound, they are shocked by the sounds of alarms coming from inside.[32]Despite that, they proceeded as planned, and Ayato opened the gate with a security keycard he had aquired beforehand. Realizing somebody was opening the cells inside, Ayato quickly decided to take advantage of the chaos. He quickly dispatched some Cochlea staff, then he left the floor to Banjou and his men to hold off the guards while he was descending further to find Hinami. However, he was intercepted byKishou Arima, narrowly dodging a bolt fromNarukamiwith help from theGas Masksmember""33"". Landing on a platform, Ayato came face-to-face with the CCG's Reaper.[33] Ayato avoids Narukami's bolts. Ayato went on the offensive, darting around Arima while simultaneously firing at him with his kagune, but was left frustrated as the investigator easily blocked his attacks. As he was leaping away from him, Ayato was grazed by another bolt which destroyed his mask. With no time to react, Ayato was caught by surprise as Arima struck several blows to his leg. Rendered immobile, Ayato looked in horror as Arima prepared the final blow. To his surprise, the attack was blocked by a ghoul. ""33"" attacked and distracted Arima, and as the next Cochlea gate opened, they went further down Cochlea. On Cochlea's SS floor, Ayato then confronted the two ghouls and told them to remove their masks, having realized his rescuers were his sisterTouka KirishimaandRenji Yomo. He questioned them why they were there, and Touka explained Banjou had told them they wanted to rescue Hinami, too. Ayato was enraged for her putting herself in danger, but Touka calmed him down, saying that he did not need to worry about her. Having settled the argument, they went on the move again.[34] Descending further down, they engaged several members ofSquad 0, but due to the sheer number of foes, they had to retreat towards the containment cell tower where they planned to find the cell Hinami was imprisoned in. However, they were unable to open the door, as the access authorization of Ayato's keycard had been revoked. The moment they decided to head towards the control room instead, Arima once again attacked them. Unable to help, he watched as Arima struck at Yomo.

After Yomo had taken the hit fromNarukami, Ayato and Touka tried to attack Arima, but they were quickly defeated.[35]After Sasaki had rescued Yomo from Arima's strike, he ordered Ayato to lead the others along the escape route. While Sasaki held off Arima, they reunited with Hinami. He apologized for taking so long to rescue her, and suggested they should continue heading to the waste compactor.[36]After they disabled the compactor, Ayato's group reunited with Banjou and they continued their escape from Cochlea. However, while proceeding through the press, Furuta activated the machine, killing many ghouls who attempted to escape.[37]While the rest who survived closed in on the exit of the Cochlea, they encounteredKiyoko AuraandMougan Tanakamaru, who Ayato engaged in a fight immediately. Mougan was aided by his colleague, who overpowered Ayato with her quinqueZebizuand grievously injured him. While they prepared to finish Ayato, Touka protected her brother with her kagune.[38]Ayato succumbed to his wounds, laying on the floor motionless. Touka quickly ran to her brother, asking Banjou to heal his wounds immediately.[39] Ayato survived, and participated inGoat's gathering, discussing the future plans of the group. He also tried to stop Naki from attacking Kaneki.[40]As theClownsattacked the CCG, Ayato discussed them alongside Kaneki,Tsukiyama, Miza, andFuka.

When Kaneki hesitated, Ayato grabbed him by the collar, telling him that every member of Goat was counting on him, including himself. Ayato then asked Kaneki to make his choice, either dealing with what was important or throwing them away for other matters. Before Kaneki could respond, Takizawa and Kurona offered taking on Amon themselves, while Ayato and Kaneki headed back with the suppressants. Ayato then departed with a reluctant Kaneki.[46]"
What did Ayato do when he was ambushed by a ghoul child?,"Ayato effortlessly avoided the attack while unleashing his wings and blasting drone-like projectiles at the child, conversing the maximum abilities of his kagune in order to remain agile.

Easily winning the fight, Ayato then proceeded to sit the kids down and question them. The children proved to be illiterate and seemingly believed themselves to be humans. When Ayato questioned what happened to the city, the children said that the 'Naaga' broke everything.[50] On the aftermath of Dragon's birth, Ayato and his squad, alongside the children from the underground city joined with the rest of Goat. While the remains of the Goat members were discussing what to do next, Ayato agreed that the missive should be to get close to Kaneki.

When Kaneki soon woke up, he found all his friends and followers sleeping around him, waiting for him.[54][55] During another meeting, Kimi deduced that the ghoulification of Tokyo was sourcing from somewhere deep underground where a ghoul toxin was being released, a toxin to which only Kaneki appeared to be immune. Ayato put himself forward as a candidate to go with Kaneki to explore the underground and find the source of the toxin.[56] Kaneki and Ayato soon arrived at the location of the toxins root, donning their gas masks. Ayato noted that the smell in the air was gross and expressed his desire to leave as soon as possible.

However, as he got older, Ayato spent less and less time at her side, and with that, he became often irritated with her and her constant worry. When Touka began to attend school, he hated hearing about her time with humans and so he left.[60]Ayato is very apprehensive about his true feelings towards Touka. He often insults her and refers to her as a ""weak"" person, just like their father was, and even goes as far as beating her up to the point of unconsciousness and ripping off her kagune. However, Kaneki sees these mannerisms as a mere shell; since Ayato had beat down Touka before Yamori could take the pleasure of torturing and killing her and expressed disgust at Nico when he comments about her appearance. Ayato cares for Touka and wishes to protect her whenever she is in trouble, given that this is what he wanted to accomplish by joiningAogiri Treeand becoming stronger. As his presence became prominent each year, he undertook the alias, ""Rabbit"" in order to cover up for Touka’s actions, clearing her name, which lead theCCGto think that it was Ayato who had murdered investigators such asKureo Mado, and therefore suspend their hunt for Touka. Ayato and Touka eventually reunite when the latter rescues him from Arima. They reconcile after she tells him he does not have to look out for her anymore."
What happened to Ayato when Kaneki confronted him about his false pretense and true motives for joining Aogiri Tree?,"Ayato became offended by this, but was in denial, despite the fact that Kaneki was telling the truth",Ken kaneki,"Ayato expresses indifference and agitation towards Kaneki, seeing him as just another useless weakling; for he is constantly reminded of his father through Kaneki’s attitude and way of talking. However, when Kaneki confronted him about his false pretense and true motives for joining Aogiri Tree, Ayato became offended by this, but was in denial, despite the fact that Kaneki was telling the truth. In√A, Ayato is usually seen partnered with Kaneki, and though he has shown little signs of aggression towards him, he does seem to consider Kaneki a comrade, trusting him during their mission to retrieve Shachi in Cochlea. Inre, Ayato held an interest in Kaneki's current self, Sasaki, asking Karao Saeki if he met Sasaki in his encounter with the Quinx Squad. His attitude towards Kaneki vastly changed, as during the Third Cochlea Raid he accepted Kaneki's aid in rescuing Hinami and deferred to his authority as the One-Eyed King without question. Ayato is also the maternal uncle of Kaneki's child with Touka. The two became brothers-in-law after Kaneki married Touka."

Finding his father is Gon's motivation in becoming a Hunter.[7]"
How old was Gon when he was rescued from an angry mother Foxbear by a man named Kite?,nine,Background,"Ging holding Gon as a baby At the age of twenty two,Ging Freecssreturned home toWhale Islandfor the first time in ten years carrying his infant son, Gon. When questioned about the child's mother, Ging simply mentioned that the pair had separated. While Ging tried to leave Gon inhis grandmother's care for a little while, Ging's cousin Mito was infuriated at Ging's parenting and got custody through the courts. Ging left Whale Island, never to return.[14] Gon saved by Kite Since his early youth, due to his father's absence and Mito's dislike of Ging, Gon was told that his parents died in an accident when he was a baby. At the age of nine, however, Gon was rescued from an angry mother Foxbear by a man namedKite—a professionalHunterand a student of Gon's long lost father. After hitting Gon in the face, Kite attempted to kill the Foxbear's cub but Gon protected it. Kite admitted to looking for Ging as a final test to be seen by his master as a true Hunter. Kite's admiration of Ging awoke in Gon the goal of meeting his father. In order to do so, Gon was driven from that moment to obtain aHunter License, also desiring to know what would cause Ging to choose his profession as a Hunter over being a parent as his motivation for becoming a Hunter.[7] Growing up, Gon was homeschooled and the only friend his age he had wasNoko.[15][16]The rustic life endowed him with keener senses and higher physical abilities than most. As he told Kite, he managed to bond with the Foxbear cub.[7]On the occasions where all-female ships landed on Whale Island, Gon would take them to town and they would teach him ""a lot of stuff"".[17]"
What is the name of Gon's aunt?,Mito Freecss,Hunter exam arc,"Gon fishing for The Master of the Swamp Gon is first seen fishing on aWhale Islandbog forThe Master of the Swamp—a fish so enormous that five grown fishermen pulling together could not land it, but Gon succeeds in catching it after a week of work. He made a wager with his auntMito Freecssthat if he could catch the fish, she would allow him to take part in theHunter Exam. After getting Mito's consent on his application to the Hunter Exam, Gon proceeds to say a bittersweet farewell toKon; aFoxbearcub raised by the boy following his first encounter withKite. Gon tells Kon that he is going to become a Hunter and that he will do things that the animals of the forest will not like. Since Kon is the king of the forest, he can not talk to Gon anymore. Kon walks away from Gon to a gathering of other animals. Gon returns home and speaks to Mito. She asks if Gon always knew his father's trade, and also tells him his father left Gon with her when he was still a baby; Gon replies that being a Hunter must be an important job if family comes second, and that it is time for him to meet his father.[7] Aunt Mito hugs Gon He is then seen preparing to board a ship heading for the Hunter Exam. Everyone in the town comes to say goodbye and wish him luck. Aunt Mito comes and tells him that his father did not abandon him; she made him give up Gon through the courts. Gon says he knew because she never looks at him when she is lying. He gets on the boat and yells back to her that he will return as a great Hunter.[7] The first night on the boat, there is a huge storm that tosses around most of the would-be Hunters. After the storm, the ship's drunkard of a captain walks around to see only three candidates still able to move . Later on, Gon is standing on the front of the boat where he predicts they will be hit by another storm, but this time it will be three times the size of the previous night. TheCaptainknows he is correct and not guessing; he sees Ging in Gon. He asks who Gon's father is, which confirms his first impression. The Captain shows Gon how to steer the boat and announces that the next storm is coming and that anyone who wants off should leave.[18] Kurapika, Gon, and Leorio standing before the Captain All but Gon,Kurapika, andLeorioleave. The Captain enquires why they want to be Hunters. Gon answers immediately while the other two do not. Leorio asks why they should tell him when he just steers the ship. The Captain replies that he screens applicants and that it is up to him whether or not they pass. The remaining two tell him. While explaining, Kurapika annoys Leorio to the point where they go out into the storm to fight. WhenKatzofalls overboard, Gon jumps after him, catching him and narrowly escaping falling into the ocean thanks to Kurapika and Leorio grabbing his ankles in time to pull them both back on board.[18] The Mind-Boggling Two Choice Quiz When they reach land, the Captain gives them a hint to head to a lone cedar tree outside of the city to find their navigators. Gon decides to go, and Kurapika tags along. Leorio splits off to take the bus toZaban City, but rejoins them when he overhears that it is trick to weed out the weak. Later they reach a village that seems to be deserted, but Gon and Kurapika hear sounds of people. Then the whole population of the village comes out to start The Mind-Boggling Two Choice Quiz.The leader of the villageasks two questions and all they can say is 1 or 2.A manwho had been tailing them walks in and says he will go first. She asks him, ""Men have taken your mother and your true love captive. Who do you save?"" He chooses 1, the mother, and is allowed to pass. Leorio starts yelling because of the preposterous question. Kurapika tells him to be quiet; he and Gon have figured out the riddle. She asks another impossible question and after the time limit is up, with none of them having said an answer, Leorio tries to attack her. Kurapika blocks it stating they passed since silence was the real answer. He adds that he heard the other man scream, meaning he was attacked. In the meanwhile, Gon keeps agonizing over the riddle until he declares he cannot find an answer. To Kurapika and Leorio, who are content with passing the test, he replies that the day may come when he really has to choose.[19] Gon strikes Kiriko After a few hours, the trio reaches a house and finds the navigator couple being attacked by aKiriko, a Magical Beast called a Kiriko. When the beast takes off with the lady, Gon and Kurapika launch themselves in pursuit while Leorio stays behind to take care of the man. Gon is amazed to find out that the Kiriko can talk. He pulls ahead of Kurapika, closes in on the Kiriko, and bashes him in the head. The Kiriko drops the wife, who Kurapika catches. Gon continues to pursue it until it confronts him into a clearing. Gon merely greets it and asks where the one he hit went to. It is revealed that the two Kiriko and the couple are a family and the Navigators, and Gon was the first human in years capable of telling the wife apart from the husband. The Kiriko flies the three to the Hunter Exam site.[20] Gon spits out Tonpa's laxative juice The next day, they arrive in Zaban City. They initially assume a majestic building is the exam hall, but a disguised Kiriko takes them toa greasy spoon place. The disguised Magical Beast orders a specific meal, then the cook sits them in a room and delivers it. The room is actually an elevator that starts to drop. As they make their way down, Kurapika and Leorio try to find out whether Gon is taking the test for gain or justice, but he cannot answer before the elevator doors open. They are immediately greeted byTonpa, who introduces himself as a friend trying to help Gon. Then he introduces some of the other regulars, such asBourbonthe Snake Charmer,Todothe Wrestler, theAmori Brothers,Cherry, andGerettathe Huntsman. While doing the introductions, they hear a bloodcurdling scream, and they look to see a man missing his arms courtesy ofHisoka, the Magician, who maimed him only because he bumped into him. Tonpa then offers Gon and the other two some juice. Gon, being the first to taste it, spits it out saying it tastes funny, leading Kurapika and Leorio to dump theirs on the ground.[21]Afterwards, Tonpa makes a hasty apology.[1] Gon meets Killua Satotz, the examiner of the First Phase, begins the287th Hunter Examwith a multi-marathon run through the underground tunnel. A boy on a skateboard notices Gon and introduces himself asKillua; the pair spends the majority of the First Phase getting to know each other. Gon notices Leorio faltering around the 60km mark. He stops and silently waits until Leorio gets his second wind, the man dropping his briefcase in the process. Gon uses his fishing pole to grab Leorio's attaché and carries it.[1]After running for 80km they come to a set of stairs and start climbing, while Satotz starts to pick up the pace. Gon discusses his reasons for wanting to become a professional Hunter with Killua until the pair reach the exit of the tunnel in the first place.[22] The First Phase continues outside, with the examinees being required to follow Satotz through the mysteriousMilsy Wetlandsin a thick fog. Gon is warned by Killua to stay close to Satotz, as he can sense that Hisoka will use the cover of the mist to satiate his bloodlust. The boys continue ahead but Gon turns around after hearing Leorio scream.[23]Gon then saves Leorio from Hisoka, who had been murdering applicants in an attempt to ""play proctor"". Gon pursues Hisoka to no avail, silently attacking until he has caught and choked. However, Hisoka takes an interest in Gon and spares the lives of him and his friends.[24] Hisoka choking Gon While Hisoka carries Leorio to the destination of the Second Phase, Gon and Kurapika follow behind him at a distance. Gon mentions that he was afraid of Hisoka and wanted to run away, but he could not, and simultaneously excited at the same time. Having the experience of mortal fear for the first time in his entire life, Gon cannot control his growing curiosity.[25] The Great Stamp is formidable, but it's not enough to excite Gon The Second Phase of the Hunter Exam takes place in theVisca Forest Preserve, where the examinees meetGourmet HuntersMenchiandBuhara—who have split the phase into two tests. Buhara's test is to findthe world's most dangerous pigand to roast it. Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio comb through the forest reserve and find a drift ofGreat Stamp. Amidst his battle with one of the boar, Gon again takes notice of how situations that threaten his life also give him a rush. However, he also realizes that he needs bigger thrills. Gon and his friends complete the task easily along with seventy other applicants.[25] Menchi's test ends up baffling nearly all of the applicants after she tells them to makesushifor her test. Due to being a traditional dish ofJappon, onlyHanzoends up knowing what it is . Gon is clueless to a solution until it is revealed to all of the examinees, but to no avail.[26]Menchi overreacts to the applicants' dismissive comments about Gourmet Hunters and fails the entire group as a result—forcingNetero, chairman over theHunter Association, to intervene. The test is taken toSplit Mountain, where examinees hunt forSpider Eagleeggs. Forty-two applicants pass the Second Phase.[27] Gon and Killua attempting to steal a ball from Netero The forty-two remaining examinees board the Selection Committee's airship at the end of the day, whereBeansexplains that the next phase of the exam will begin at 8:00 a.m. in the morning. As everyone rests up for tomorrow, Gon and Killua spend their time getting to know each other. Killua tells Gon about how he has run away from home in order to escape his overbearingfamily of assassinsuntil being interrupted by Netero, who offers to immediately issue the boys Hunter Licenses if they can grab a ball from him.[28]The two give it their best efforts individually with no progress made until they attack Netero together; though they come seemingly close to succeeding, Netero shatters their hopes by proving the game impossible to win after revealing that he has not used two of his limbs at all. Killua gets frustrated, quits, and then murders two applicants after the game out of frustration. Gon, however, continues to play until he forces Netero to use his right hand through a near-suicide tactic. When he succeeds in doing so, Gon passes out in exhaustion.[29] The next morning, the Hunter Association's airship arrives at the top ofTrick Tower, a prison filled with traps in order to prevent its inmates from escaping. Beans inform the 40 remaining applicants that the objective of the Third Phase is to reach the bottom of the tower alive within 72 hours.[29]Gon and Killua survey the area and discover there to be trapdoors embedded within the floor. They report their findings to Kurapika and Leorio and each goes through a trapdoor, coincidentally all landing in the same room. The four learn that they have inadvertently selectedThe Path of Majority Rules;Lippo, one of three proctors over the Third Phase, explains that the group is required to proceed through the tower based upon the decision belonging to the majority. However, the group is forced to team up with Tonpa after he slips through the ceiling.[30] Gon wins his match After a couple of hours of walking, the group comes to an arena over a seemingly bottomless pit. Their first challenge is to win 3 out of 5 competitive matches, using any type of method, against convicts sentenced to life imprisonment. Tonpa purposefully fails the first match and proves to be untrustworthy.[31]Gon faces the next prisoner, a serial bomber by the name ofSedokan, in a match to see whose candle can burn the longest. Sedokan presents Gon the choice of one of the candles, one short and one long, in a desperate choice. Gon selects the long candle, but it is later revealed that Sedokan had rigged the game for the boy to fail. Using his wits, Gon wins his match and is the first to attain victory on his team.[32] Passing the Third Phase of the Hunter Exam Kurapika manages to win his trial as well, facing off against aPhantom Troupeimposterin a deathmatch.[33]Leorio, pitted againsta prisonerin a gambling match, loses both the round and fifty hours of their time as well.[34]Although Killua is victorious in the fifth round, the team is forced to wait for fifty hours inside of a room due to Leorio's loss.[35]With only nine hours remaining in the Trick Tower, the team works together until they reach a crossroad that happens to be their final test on the Path of Majority Rules. After some bickering, Gon comes up with a clever solution that allows all five to successfully pass the Third Phase of the Hunter Exam.[36] Gonsilencing his presenceto stalk Hisoka The Fourth Phase is a manhunt onZevil Island, wherein the 25 remaining competitors being required to target and acquire their prey's number badge. Gon draws Hisoka and is thrilled by the hunt.[37]Upon arrival, Gon struggles to come up with a way to acquire Hisoka's badge until he observes a hunt for the first time . Thus, Gon spends an entire day and his next morning learning how to hunt through attempting to reel in live prey using his fishing rod. Gon realizes that hunting requires waiting to strike as your prey attacks his own target; he chooses this method to attempt to steal Hisoka's badge.[38]With his training completed, Gon thereafter utilizesHemotropic Butterflies to stalk Hisoka. Gon finds the man,naturally silences his presenceby slowing his heart rate and stopping his breathing, and lies in wait.[39] Gon waits untilGoz, another applicant, accosts Hisoka for a fight in front of him. He sees it as his chance to put his new skills into practice, but Hisoka refuses to fight the suicidal warrior.Gittarackursuddenly intervenes and kills Goz, his target. Gon watches as Hisoka and Gittarackur have a conversation as if they were friends, the new party giving the magician a badge he took fromanother applicant.[40] Hisoka knocks Gon out Night falls and Hisoka resumes stalking for prey, eventually spotting Kurapika and Leorio from a distance;[40]he chooses to pursue them. Gon follows behind Hisoka and realizes that his two new friends are being targeted. Conflicted, Gon initially decides to stick with his plan until he realizes that it would also mean sacrificing his friends, thereafter resolving to help them if the situation took a turn for the worst. The duo manages to negotiate their way out of any danger from Hisoka and Gon continues to watch him. Hisoka's bloodlust flares overnight and shoots a terrible fear through Gon. It is the first time he ever feels such an ominous aura.[12] The next day, Gon manages to get Hisoka's numbered plate and is temporarily paralyzed when shot byGerettawith a blow dart coated in a muscle relaxant. Hisoka then kills Geretta, but gives Gon back his plate and then his own. Gon manages to stand to his feet and refuses Hisoka's charity, insisting the magician takes back his plate. The former refuses, punching the latter and declaring that he will not take his badge back until he can retaliate. Gon spends the night quietly seething over the violation to his pride.[41] After being made helpless by Hisoka, Gon's pride is wounded for the first time During the Fourth Phase's final day, Gon finds Leorio and Kurapika and chooses to help Leorio to acquire his target's badge fromPonzu.[42]He is confronted by Kurapika after the phase ends. Gon confesses what happened to him and expresses the humiliation and frustration he feels from losing, shedding tears. Kurapika lifts his spirits as the two head towards the Hunter Exam's Final Phase.[43] Hanzo deals the first blow The Final Phase was a tournament with each of the participants.[43]After being selected by the judges as being the most exceptional applicants,Hanzoand Gon face off first. Gon is outmatched when it comes to combat,[44]but his unwillingness to submit causes Hanzo to forfeit the battle—making Gon the first applicant to pass the 287th Hunter Exam. At first, Gon refuses to accept the win, insisting that the two of them can figure out a way to have a proper match. Hanzo, annoyed, knocks Gon out[45]and the boy does not awake until the Exam has ended. Satotz fills in the details and explains to Gon that only two people did not pass the exam—Bodoroand Killua. It is revealed that Gittarackur is actually an alias for Killua's older brother,Illumi.[46]Killua was manipulated into murdering another contestant and subsequently failed the exam.[47]Gon, enraged, confronts Illumi, breaking the assassin's wrist in the process, and gets Killua's address.[11]Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio all then depart to Killua's home onKukuroo Mountain.[48] Gon beaten by Canary Along withKurapikaandLeorio, Gon heads to Killua's house on Kukuroo Mountain in order to bring him back. After reaching the Zoldyck estate, the trio is blocked by thea gate requiring 4 tons of force to open.[48]Gon attempts to reason with a Zoldyck butler namedGotohbut reaches an impasse, the latter adamantly opposed to his entry. Gon then tries to break into the estate on an impulse until he is calmed down byZebro, the gatekeeper. Zebro introduces the trio toMike—the trained Zoldyck attack dog—putting great fear into Gon.[49] Zebro takes the trio back to his quarters near Kukuroo Mountain and allows them to weight train under him for two weeks, in order to gain the strength to open theTesting Gatethemselves.[49]They then proceed toward the mountain and are again blocked—this time, by a butler's apprentice namedCanary. Ordered never to let anyone pass, she expels intruders through force. Gon spends the day walking toward her and, consequently, getting walloped by her. His tenacity touches Canary,[50]who wavers and leads the trio to the butlers' quarters in order to meet with Killua.[51] While the trio waits for Killua to arrive, Gotoh, infuriated by the audacity of Gon to try and remove Killua from his family, threatens the lives of the trio and Canary under the guise of a game. Thanks to some quick thinking and sharp eyesight, Gon is victorious and earns Gotoh's approval. Killua arrives and the reunited four depart from theRepublic of Padokea.[52] Next meeting: September 1st, in Yorknew City As the four head to the nearest airport, the four discuss their plans now that the Hunter Exam has ended. Gon, still angry about his humiliation in the Fourth Phase, wishes to find Hisoka, punch him in the face, and return the badge he was given. Kurapika plans to go toYorknew Cityon September 1stfor theSouthernpiece Auctiondue to a tip he received from Hisoka regarding the Phantom Troupe. Leorio informs the group of his immediate plans to study for his medical school exams. The four vow to reunite in Yorknew City in September and the elder two depart.[53]"
What is the name of the young student of Shingen-ryukung fu?,Zushi,Heavens arena arc,"Gon realizes he has become stronger With Killua as his sole companion, Gon is at a loss as to how to accomplish his immediate goal. By drawing a line on the ground, Killua shows him the overwhelming power gap between him, Hisoka, and Hanzo, later adding himself at Gon's request. He adds that Gon cannot beat Hisoka by training for a mere six months, which Gon agrees with. Killua suggests training their combat skills and earning money at theHeavens Arena. They spend the last of their money to fly to the city where the building is. Following Killua's suggestion, Gon writes in his form that he has 10 years' worth of combat experience. Gon is awed by the various matches, and also by the revelation that Killua had already been there and it had taken him two years to reach the 200thfloor. Gon is called for his match, and Killua tells him to just push the opponent. Although Gon has never really fought before, he finds that his strength has increased considerably after training at Kukuroo Mountain, and he effortlessly pushes his adversary out of bounds, earning the right to go to the 50thfloor.[53] Gon and Zushi's dumbfounded by Killua's expenses Gon and Killua meet a boy named Zushi, the young student ofShingen-ryukung fuand the disciple ofWing. Gon and Zushi are baffled by the prizes awarded at higher floors, and also by Killua having managed to squander the money he won in the past in snacks. Killua and Zushi are called to compete against each other. Gon wins his own match without problems and waits for his friend. Killua explains his belatedness as Zushi being in the possession of a mysterious secret technique whose ominous vibrations reminded him ofhis brother. The technique, which his teacher called ""Ren"", made him more resilient against his attacks, which should have knocked him out. He then states he wants to go all the way to the top floor, which was Gon's intention from the start.[54] Wing demonstrates ""Ren"" The two-win four more matches and earn the right to a room, having reached the 100thfloor. Killua warns Gon that the caliber of their opponents will increase, but Gon effortlessly makes it to the 150thfloor. After cashing in his prize, Gon brings up Zushi and Ren and suggests asking the former about the technique. His explanation, however, is unintelligible to them. When Wing shows up, Killua convinces him to explain it to them. The four relocate to his hotel room. He proceeds to illustrate theNen of the Flameto them. He first calmly states he will kill Killua, then repeats his utterance after performing the four steps, which causes Killua to leap away and Gon to shiver with fear. The two leave, but Killua tells Gon that Wing lied to them and that no mental technique could have allowed Zushi to survive a strike that should have been lethal.[55] Wing demonstrates Hatsu When they reach the 200thfloor, they find themselves unable to walk down the hallway to registration, as an intense bloodlust stops them in their tracks. Gon wonders if the one responsible is thefloor's clerkuntil Hisoka reveals himself. He explains he tracked them through the internet and warns them they are not ready for the 200thfloor. He waves his hand, and they are again struck with dread, unable to advance. Wing tells them that they cannot overcome hisNenthrough effort alone without dying and decides to train them. Gon asks the clerk what will happen if they are not back by midnight, which in his case would result in starting over on the first floor, whereas in Killua's in a permanent ban. Back in Wing's hotel room, he demonstrates a non-hostile Ren, which they manage to sense faintly. After he teaches them about the true Nen — a skill utilizing the technician's life energy for combat - they are shocked to see him crack a wall just by laying his hand on it.[56] Gon and Killua discover theiraura Wing then proposes to forcefully open their Aura Nodes through an injection ofHatsu, specifying it is a dangerous method. Gon, however, is confident they can rely on him. He removes his jacket as instructed and can feel Wing's aura as a hot force pushing against him. When Wing jolts his and Killua's Aura Nodes open, they see their aura gushing out, which a shocked Gon likens to steam from a kettle. They follow Wing's instructions and quickly learn to contain their aura viaTen, causing Wing to recognize their immense talent. He tests them by sending a wave of hisRen, and, when they manage to walk against it, they return to the 200thfloor registration. They make it across Hisoka's own Nen barrier. Gon confirms that he has come to the Heavens Arena to train to defeat the magician, who states he is not ready to face him yet. He agrees to duel Gon if he can win a match on the 200thfloor. As he leaves, Gon and Killua are greeted byRiehlvelt,Sadaso, andGido.[57] Gon and Killua at registration After the clerk excitedly explains to them the rules of that floor and above, their lack of response to her enthusiasm irritating her, Gon decides to register for a match right away. Killua warns him that the three fighters from before are trying to find out when he wants to fight, and he lets them choose. The pair walk to their rooms, where they find out Gon will fight the following day, March 11th. Gon is thrilled at the prospect of fighting, and although he does not expect to win, he is ecstatic he can train his new power. The following afternoon, he faces off against Gido, who surrounds him with spinning tops enhanced with aura. They bonce off against one another and hit him in the back, which to the boy feels as though someone had struck him with a sledgehammer.[58] Gon risks his life to become stronger After taking several hits, Gon closes his eyes and tries to sense them by their aura, but this causes his Ten to fade. Another top strikes him and he bounces off the ring. From a top that spins harmlessly next to him and the referee's unwillingness to step on the ring, Gon deduces the tops are not targeting him specifically, but, like ""sumo tops"", simply ram into anything nearby. He rushes Gido and attempts to kick him, but his opponent starts spinning and sends him crashing into a wall. One point short of losing, Gon goes over his options. He decides to deactivate Ten and focus his senses on the tops completely, ignoring Killua's protests. Without his awareness, he has entered a state ofZetsu, one of theFour Major Principleshe naturally learned during the Fourth Phase of the Hunter Exam. with his eyes closed, he finally manages to avoid the tops.[59]Gon keeps it up for over an hour, even when the ring is filled with 50 tops. At one point, however, he finds himself completely surrounded. A single top hits him, breaking his arm and a few ribs. Even in those dire circumstances, he feels electrified from the risk.[60] Killua rebukes Gon for his recklessness Back in his room, he apologizes to Killua, who scolds him for his carelessness, and to Wing. The teacher slaps him, appalled by his actions but ultimately relieved he survived. Gon apologizes again, but Wing forbids him to study Nen or fight for two months, the supposed time of his convalescence . Gon promises to respect his prohibition, and ties a string around his little finger. When Killua and Wing leave the room, Gon performs the Ten of the Flame, meditating on Ging's abandonment and Kite's revelation that he is still alive.[60]One month later, Gon has already made a full recovery, much to Killua's astonishment. Killua shows him the tickets for one of Hisoka's matches. He reveals to Gon that he never lost whenever he fought, that he only ever lost 4 points, and that he is considered to be on par with theFloor Masters. Gon proclaims he is worried, but his expression betrays his excitement. Just as he wonders if Wing will let him spectate the match, the teacher appears behind him, forbidding him to go. To himself, he notes that the Ten of the Flame has made Gon's and Killua's aura flows tranquil and smooth. Killua laments wasting his money on Gon's ticket, causing the boy to silently remark he is a millionaire. Back in his room, Gon, swallowing the temptation, turns off the TV.[61] Gon, Killua, and Zushi watch the tape of Hisoka's match At the end of the month, Wing allows Gon and Killua to train along with Zushi. Gon admits that it was hard to keep his promise, but looking at the string calmed him. He is taken aback by the teacher's joke that it was due to his Nen. Asked to use Ten, Gon worries that he may have forgotten how. His fear, however, is unfounded, as his flow is smoother and more powerful than before, which is due to his meditation exercises. Looking at the string, he notices it is broken and that there aremarkingson it. Wing authorizes Gon to watch the tape of Hisoka's match. The three students are unable to see the strands of aura attached to his arm. Wing instructs Gon and Killua to practice their Ren until they can see through Hisoka'sInand has Zushi demonstrateGyo, whose power impresses Gon. Wing tells Gon and Killua to register for a fight on the last available day so they can practice Gyo. On their way to their rooms, the three disciples feel Gido's, Riehlvelt's, and Sadaso's aura. The three insist on fighting them to score easy victories. When Sadaso demonstrates hisNen ability, Gon tells him he cannot fight before June 10th. When Sadaso objects that his own deadline is May 29th, Killua retorts they do not care and the three leave, but not before Sadaso ominously assures Gon the two of them will fight.[62] Honing Ren with Zushi They train their Ren in Killua's room, with Gon commenting his and Killua's are not as powerful as Zushi's. Later that evening, Gido blackmails Gon into fighting them by telling him they have kidnapped Zushi, leaving one of the boy's shoes in front of his door as proof. Gon registers for the fights. The following day, he manages to see Hisoka's aura, but fails to figure out its properties. From Killua's request to fight on May 29th, Gon surmises he was blackmailed too. After the lecture, he states he does not mind losing on purpose but is concerned the rookie crushers may threaten Zushi again. Killua tells him not to worry.[63] He scares Sadaso into withdrawing, giving Gon and himself one win by default, and Gido and Riehlvelt into playing by the rules. Training resumes as normal until the day of the match when Gon tells Wing he intends to use his fishing rod. He charges at Gido as soon as the match begins, but his opponent starts spinning right off the bat. He launches his tops at Gon withShotgun Blues, who, to inflict greater psychological damage, obliterates them with Ren instead of swatting them down. He tries to hook Gido with the fishing rod, and, when this fails, flips over the floor tile he is spinning on. Gon is immediately on Gido and snaps his peg leg with a punch, admonishing his opponent that the next time he threatens Zushi he will hit him in the face. Gon is declared the victor of the match.[64] Hisoka agrees to fight Gon He later congratulates Killua on his victory against Riehlvelt, stating he came up with a plan to counter the electric whips. He faces off against Riehlvelt bare-handed, who pulls out his whips from the start. Gon hurls a floor tile at him, leaving him a way out so he can jump him right after he propels himself withAura Burst. He breaks both of his wrists and ties the two whips around his opponent's neck, then pretends to turn them up to max and switch them on. Riehlvelt faints from fright. As Gon walks out of the arena, victorious, Hisoka tells him to choose the date and place of their duel.[65]Wing introduces his three students to Hatsu. ThroughWater Divination, Gon is revealed to be anEnhancer. He phones Hisoka and they schedule their fight for July 10that the Heavens Arena. After one month of practicing Hatsu, Gon's improvement is such that Wing asserts he passed thesecret Hunter Exam, which requires Hunter to know Nen. Gon enquires about the progress of the examinees who passed along with him, and Wing tells him.[6] Gon returns Hisoka's tag On the day of the match, Gon fearlessly rushes at Hisoka, who however repels all his attacks without moving from his spot. He loses one point to Hisoka's feint, which prompts him to flip a floor tile in front of Hisoka and shatter it with a kick, sending the pieces flying at him. While Hisoka deflects them, Gon slips in his blind spot and punches him in the face,[66]earning two points. The two contenders pause long enough for Gon to return Hisoka his badge. As they take their stances again, Hisoka asks Gon how much he learned about Nen. He deduces that Gon is an Enhancer and details hispersonality test, which Gon finds accurate. The magician dashes at him and pummels him one-sidedly, with Gon's eyes managing to keep track of him, but his body failing to react in time. He keeps his distance while trying to come up with a plan until he uses Gyo and sees that Hisoka has attached hisBungee Gumto his cheek. The magician pulls him within range and lands a heavy punch on him.[67] Gon's predicament The score being 6-2 for Hisoka, Gon stands up with some difficulty. Hisoka offers to let him get a free hit if he can tell him when he attached hisBungee Gum, giving him three options. Gon goes with the third, only to be feel cheated when Hisoka reveals it was the fourth one: during the explanation of the personality test. Gon regrets not using Gyo earlier, but Hisoka makes him understand he had no way of avoiding his ability. Since he cannot keep his distance, Gon runs towards Hisoka. His courage, determination, and initiative cause Hisoka to unleash his lustful killing intent. Shivering but pushing through it, Gon strikes him repeatedly while Hisoka struggles to prevent himself from killing him until he is yanked towards Hisoka's fist again. He manages to block the second punch, but the referee counts it as a critical hit. Gon complains, to no avail. Hisoka warns him he will attack from the right. As the boy turns, he contracts theBungee Gumhe attached to a piece of stone while Gon was complaining, hitting him on his left cheek. Hisoka wins by TKO and says that the next time the two fight, their match will be to the death. Acknowledging he is still much weaker than the magician, Gon resolves to become stronger. Having reached their goals, Gon and Killua leave the Heavens Arena and head for Whale Island.[68]"
Where do Gon and Killua meet Phinks and Feitan?,Southernpiece Auction House,Greed island arc,"Gon and Killua show their Ren to Tsezguerra On September 6th, Gon hopes Kurapika's fever won't go down for a while, so he will not go after the remaining Spiders. Unlike Killua, he is convinced that revenge is no longer Kurapika's objective. He tells his friend his plan[99]to be hired byBatteraas players instead of trying to purchase the game,[101]which Killua reckons to be likely to succeed. They head to the Southernpiece Auction House, where they meet Phinks and Feitan. Phinks cuts their retreat and announces they are not pursuing Kurapika, since his Nen may become stronger after his death and become too much for Chrollo to bear. Gon enquires about Pakunoda, learning, to his displeasure, she has died. Phinks tells him she was thankful to him and Killua.[99]When the auction begins, Gon discovers the cartridges were sold not by Ging, but by a Hunter namedJeitsari. He accidentally doubles a bid on the game, but luckily Battera outbids him. Gon and Killua later approach him, claiming to be Hunters and offering to play the game for him. They are initially not believed, but Battera agrees to haveTsezguerraassess them informally when Gon reveals he owns a save file of the game and the ring. At Tsezguerra's request, the boys perform Ren; however, their prowess is deemed insufficient.[101] The consoles in Battera's castle Gon lashes at Tsezguerra, and the two vow to pass his tryouts on September 10th. Instead of working on their Ten and Ren, as usual, Killua suggests using the four days at their disposal to create a Nen ability. Gon, however, does not know where to begin.[102]When Kurapika recovers, he tries to convince him to stay in Yorknew a while longer, to no avail. He asks him to be his teacher, but Kurapika declines and recommends Gon call his master. Wing insists that Gon not to create a slapdash ability, but that he shows Tsezguerra every technique he has learned at the same time. The apparent irreconcilability of Ren and Zetsu has him despair at first until he remembers he can use Gyo to focus his aura in one spot and shut it off everywhere else.[103]Gon practices a sequence of Ten, Gyo, and Zetsu to concentrate all his aura in his fist before increasing it with Ren. While he trains, Zepile raises enough money for him to buy back his license.[104]On the day of the interviews, Gon waits calmly in his seat until his turn.[105]He passes after Killua, showing Tsezguerra hisKoand hitting the wall with it at his request. Both boys pass the selection and, after having Leorio look at the contract, ride a train to Battera's castle. The newly hired players have a rock-paper-scissors tournament to decide the order of entrance, and Gon goes first, accessing the game with the save file left by Ging.[106] Gon, eager and ready for the game He meetsEta, who plays a message left by Ging for him saying the game contains no clues and that he simply wanted to show it to him. She then explains the mechanics of the game to him. As soon as he walks out of theStarting Point, he feels eyes on himself. He anxiously waits for Killua while the other players recently hired by Battera arrive one by one.[107]When Killua enters the game, they play rock-paper-scissors to decide which direction to go, and Gon wins. They begin to wander around in the prairie until they are approached byLatarza. He easily understands they are new players and casts ""Trace"" on Killua, before retreating upon feeling the boy's bloodlust.[108]They head to the closest city,Antokiba, while wondering about the spell cast on Killua, which the latter determines to be magic from the game. They familiarize themselves with the monthly contests held in the city, the card conversion system, and the currency used in the game, the latter piece of knowledge being acquired at the cost of working in a restaurant for a few hours after eating a meal without knowingJennyare not an accepted method of payment. Hearing a commotion, they run towards it and findJeetdead, his midsection having blown up from the inside. The two boys become fearful that the spell cast on Killua might have a similar effect, butNickesassures them there are no such spells on the island and that the culprit isanother player. He invites them to join his alliance, claiming to have a surefire, non-violent method to clear the game.[109] Gon and Killua meet Kazsule and his allies Gon and Killua are initially suspicious, but accept to follow him when he gives them information about spells and teaches them to summon their binders when other players target them. Other recruits are present at the meeting, such asBiscuit,Abengane, and Puhat.Genthruexplains that no spells can harm players in the game and that the ones cast on the recruits are meant to gather information. He claims Jeet was killed by a ruthless player known as ""TheBomber"". Gon, Abengane, and Killua then guess the three different methods to gather cards. Nickes incites them to join him so they can end put an end to the violence of the game.[110]Gon apologizes to Killua and refuses the offer, bothered by the way Nickes talks about Ging's creation. He confesses he is upset that players would go to such lengths to acquire cards. He resolves to follow his father's advice and enjoy the game, telling Killua how happy he is they are there together. Unbeknownst to them, Biscuit is spying on them, keen on ruining their friendship. Gon then teaches Killua his trick to win at rock-paper-scissors, which was taught to him by a fisherman and consists in carefully looking at the opponent's fist right before the throw.[111] Gon and Killua lose ""Sword of Truth"" Both make it to the finals of the monthly tournament, the contest being rock-paper-scissors. Killua defeats Gon by switching hands at the last second and obtains their first specified slot card, ""Sword of Truth"".[112]They come up with a few methods to defend their prize without spells. They notice they are being followed, but their tactics manage to thwart the attempts of the first two players who try to take their ""Sword of Truth"", with Gon taking the spell card from a third player's hand before he can cast it. In the end, however, they are surrounded by a group of competent players and lose the card. They decide to go toMasadorato get spells.[113]They exchange their cards for money and buy asketch map of the island. They are excited to learn that monsters and bandits lurk on the way to Masadora. Before they leave, Biscuit begs them to let her join them.[114] Meeting the Sick Villagers Despite their speed, Biscuit manages to keep up with them. At one point they seem to be ambushed bybandits, who however implore them to give them money to purchase medicine to fight off a deadly epidemy. Gon and Killua give them almost everything they have but surprisingly get nothing in return. As soon as they leave the forest and head into thebadlands, they are attacked byCyclops. Gon's punch has no effect on them, but they manage to easily defeat the whole group when Killua discovers their eye is their weakness. They are forced to flee when spotted by aMelanin Lizard.[115]They waste ten minutes trying unsuccessfully to catch aHyper Puffballand later aBubble Horse. They repeatedly fail to beat different Greed Island monsters until they see a suit of armor walking towards them. Biscuit impatiently tells them to use Gyo, which allows them to find theRadio Ratcontrolling it and turn it intoa card. Biscuit proclaims herself their new Nen instructor.[116]After introducing herself, she reveals she used to be Wing's teacher and shows the two boys she has defeated the monsters they struggled against, claiming there is plenty of players who could kill them. She then sensesBinolt's bloodlust and pretends to fight with them to make him target her when she goes off by herself. After taking a detour, Gon and Killua reach her in time to see her effortlessly defeat her opponent.[117] Gon and Killua vs. Binolt Gon asks her why she came to Greed Island, and after stating she wants to obtain aBlue Planet, she returns the question. Gon is surprised to discover she has heard of his father, whom Netero claims to be one of the best Nen users in the world. As their first training exercise, she has Gon and Killua fight Binolt for two weeks inside a rocky arena. They are unable to approach him until Gon, taking the cue from Killua, strikes the wall with Ko and uses a boulder as a shield.[118]Half a day later, they have him surrounded with rocks, blocking his field of vision. Gon creates a diversion, allowing Killua to pin him to the ground, but Gon stops him and insists on training for the whole two weeks until they can take him one on one. He allows Binolt to rest, awakening when he tries to use Zetsu. By the tenth day, both he and Killua become strong enough to defeat him. He acknowledges it, but Gon thanks him for his help. As he hoped, Binolt promises to leave the island and turn himself in.[9] Gon and Killua dig with Shu Grinding the progress of their game to a screeching halt, Biscuit Krueger focuses on training the two boys physically and in Nen. She starts by having them run to Masadora in three hours and back in two and a half, both trips leaving Gon winded. Instead of buying spells, she acquires two shovels and a wheelbarrow, ordering her students to dig their way to Masadora. The training is exhausting, and, to top it off, Biscuit has them sleep while keeping a part of their brain vigilant, which severely cuts on Gon's sleep. After a couple of days, Gon comes up with the idea of enfolding the shovel with his aura, discoveringShu. This allows them to progress much more rapidly, but also to tire out more quickly.[119]They steadily improve and finally make it to Masadora, only to return to the badlands once again. Biscuit has them face off against all the monsters in the region, with Gon falling two weeks behind Killua while trying to catch the Bubble Horse. Biscuit then introduces them to Ko, which Gon recognizes as his special attack. She tells them the best defense against it isKen, a prolonged state of Ren. She nudges Gon with her Ko-covered fist, knocking him back and causing him to bleed, leading them to realize the power of the technique. She tries again, this time waiting for Gon to exhaust his aura, which occurs in about two minutes.[120] Gon's desire for strength can finally be manifested through the development of his Nen ability After one month of Shu and Ken training, Gon becomes capable of holding Ken for 30 minutes. Her next teaching isRyu, the instantaneous redistribution of aura through Gyo for combat purposes, and has them hone it by sparring together. Theystart off slowly,[121]but become capable of performing Ryu at combat speed in only two weeks. She thus introduces them to training by Nen type.[122]After learning the origins of the game rock-paper-scissors, Gon bases his Nen ability on it. His Enhancement attack,Rock, is successful, but he is unable toemithis aura forPaper.[123]He decides to makeScissorsaTransmutationtechnique, and to chant while charging up his attacks. Discovering it is almost New Year's Eve, Gon reminds Killua of the approaching deadline for the Hunter Exam. They head to Masadora to learn how to leave the island, and, after defeating aWolf Packand theHarbormaster, Killua leaves the island. Gon recommends him to ask theKirikoto take him to the exam site. While Killua is gone, Gon continues his training.[124] Shortly after the separation, he and Biscuit areapproachedby Abengane,[124]who tells them that Genthru is the Bomber and about the fate of the alliance, asking them to avenge him and prevent Genthru from clearing the game. After he leaves, Gon asks Biscuit how long it will take him to master his Nen ability. She replies years will be necessary, but that he is not far from achieving what he envisions. He considers going to the alliance's hideout. Biscuit reflects it is unlikely they can help them but thinks their hideout might contain useful clues if they were to meet the Bomber later on. They head to Masadora and buy spell cards, deducing from the new shipment that the alliance members are dead. They find the rare ""Fortress"" and agonize over what to do with it, with Gon wishing Killua was with them.[125]Gon continues practicing Emission and Ryu, improving at an even pace.[126]Gon and Biscuit welcome Killua back when he returns, having passed the Hunter Exam. They have him take charge of the card distribution. To get used to casting spells, he has Gon try ""Contact"". They are shocked to see the name ""Chrollo Lucilfer"" in his binder. They disclose to Biscuit their history with Kurapika and Phantom Troupe, who in turn tells them aboutExorcism. Killua briefly leaves the game to phone Kurapika and returns telling Gon their friend was not fazed by the news and that the player is not the real Chrollo. At Biscuit's invitation,[127]Gon shows Killua the prototypes forPaperandScissors. The two squabble over Gon's decision to chant while preparing the moves, which Biscuit approved of because to him it felt natural.[128] The trio, collecting cards The three finally start playing the game for real, with Gon usingRockto obtain threeKing White Stag Beetles, which however they are unable to monopolize. They acquire one ""Gold Dust Girl"" each and one ""Paladin's Necklace"" from the monthly tournament in Antokiba, which theyduplicatebeforeconvertingit so Gon can wear it. On the way toDorias, they collect ""Witch's Love Potion"", ""Risky Dice"", and ""Memory Helmet"".[128]Kazsule, who took ""Sword of Truth"" from them, contacts them for a trade. They exchange one ""Witch's Love Potion"" for one ""Book of V.I.P. Passes"". Killua wins a ""Rainbow Diamond"" and a ""Fledgling Gambler"" with the help of theRisky Diceuntil Biscuit is forced to knock him out to halt his budding gambling addiction. By facing all manners of trials, over the course of one month they gather 50 specified slot cards in total, among which are ""Fledgling CEO"", ""Doyen's Growth Pills"", and ""Staff of Judgment"". Gon is surprised they have managed to convert so many rare items into cards, which leads Killua to conclude there aren't many competitive teams. Gon's words inspire Killua into getting into the business of trading ""Leave"" cards to weak players in return forrarecards, raising their total number to 57[129]and later to 61 . They resolve to keep looking for cards on their own while also trading players they encounter for them and information.[130] Gon obtains ""Wild Luck Alexandrite"" Thanks to thePaladin's Necklace, Gon discovers afake""Favor Cushion"" and receives the real one. This leads him to wonder if he can cure the villagers they donated their belongings to. Their charity causes the villagers to trust them, and the necklaceheals them. In return, the villagers give them a ""Wild Luck Alexandrite"".[131]Kazsule contacts them again, offering to form analliancesince Genthru is close to completing the game. By giving the group information about Genthru's ability, they obtain tworarecards. Gon's willingness to cooperate also earns them a lot of crucial information. The alliance decides to monopolize one of the four cards Genthru's team lacks, and settle on No. 2, which no player has yet, which theydiscoverto be inSoufrabi.[132] Facing Razor's pirates for the first time AnNPCoffers to point them to ""Plot of Beach"" if they driveRazorand his14 Devilsout of the town. The alliance heads to a bar where they find four pirates. When they ask them to leave,Bopobochallenges them to push him out of a flaming ring.[133]Zehogoes first, but he is easily subdued. The pirate holds him over the fire, so Gon kicks him to force him to let go. Killua stops Gon before he can useRockand takes on Bopobo himself. He wins the confrontation, so the alliance members are taken to the lighthouse-turned-gym where Razor and the other pirates each challenge an opponent to a sport.[134]The first discipline is boxing, and thepiratein charge of it defeatsMontreuxwith only Gon, Killua, and Biscuit comprehending how he did it. Realizing their allies are too weak to be of use, Gon's team throw their matches while gathering as much information on the contests as possible. The alliance eventually loses and disbands, surmising the Bomber will not be able to form the necessary group of 15 to win the card. Gon, Killua, Biscuit, andGoreinuhowever decide to try again after finding more powerful allies.[135] Hisoka taken aback by Gon The four brainstorm to find potential teammates in their contacts, with Gon considering Binolt, who however is either dead or has left the game. He then proposes finding out who ""Chrollo"" is since an alias would not make sense if it were simply a Spider seeking to clear the game, which theydeterminenot to be the case. Despite Killua's objections, Gon insists on finding out who it is. Theyteleportto him and find out ""Chrollo"" is Hisoka, who tells them he is looking for Chrollo inside the game. Biscuit invites him to join their alliance to defeat Razor while discreetly informing the others he is lying.[136]He takes them toAiai, his constant leering disquieting Gon and Killua. After falling for one of the city's cliché romantic incidents, Gon proposes enlisting Tsezguerra's help even if he is close to completing the game. He asks Hisoka to check his binder to see if he has him among his contacts, which he does.[137] The new team Goreinu negotiates for them and Tsezguerra accepts. Killua wants to test him first. He and Gon are impressed with his jumping ability and copy it, shattering his record on the first try. Gon challenges Killua multiple times but keeps losing. Their alliance now counting nine members, they each choose a sport that fits their abilities. Gon initially planned to do boxing, but, whenBarryvolunteers instead, he is assigned to volleyball with Tsezguerra. After a week of training, they head to the lighthouse, having recruited six more players to reach the necessary number. Barry,Kess, andRodriotbest their opponents, after which Razor plans to enter the game himself. Bopobo incites a revolt but is killed by Razor.[138]He then challenges them to a game of dodgeball with the aid of his sevenNen beasts. This proves problematic for the alliance since the weaker players refuse to participate. Still believing him to be an NPC, Gon asks Razor what Bopobo did to deserve to die, and is shocked to learn that he was a death row convict and that Greed Island takes place in the real world. He thus enquires if Ging is on the island, which causes Razor to recognize Gon as his son and to go all out, as requested to him by his father. Goreinu uses his own ability so they have eight players and the match begins.[139]The alliance takes out two of Razor's Nen beasts before he strikes back. Gon and Killua manage to follow his lightning-fast passages and warn Tsezguerra, who reacts to the throw-in time to survive, although he is eliminated. Gon tells Hisoka to useBungee Gumon the ball so they can keep throwing.[140] ""A monster! Ging, rejoice. There's no doubt about it...he's definitely your son."" However, Razor's team eventually retrieves it. He aims a throw at Gon, who protects himself with Ko; however, since he neglected to reinforce his legs, he is thrown into a wall and eliminated. Eager to catch Razor's next throw, Gon declares he will be the one to call, ""Back"". Killua convinces him to wait until only two players on their team are left.[141]When Biscuit is eliminated, Gon moves back on the court, brimming with such determination and anger that he manages to persuade Killua he must catch Razor's throw to really win. He has Killua hold the ball and begins to chargeRock.[142]He manages to eliminate Razor's strongest Nen beast, but is still unsatisfied, as he would need more power to take out Razor. He builds up aura again before unleashing an even more powerful punch. However, Razor kills the momentum of the ball with a bump, awing Gon. Hisoka catches the ball withBungee Gum, forcing Razor to use up his freebie.[143]Tsezguerra requests a time-out and offers to hold the ball for Gon, knowing that Killua's hands were mangled by the previous throws. Gon, however, replies that he can but needs Killua to give it his best. He comes up with a formation to recover the ball from Razor.[144]With it, they manage to block his tremendously powerful spike. Gon then builds up even more aura than before in preparation for his last attack.[145]Razor deflects the ball back at him, confident he will not dodge; however, having used up all his aura, Gon passes out, and the ball flies harmlessly over him. To honor his wish of a crushing victory, Hisoka usesBungee Gumto send the ball back at Razor and stick it to his hands until he is pushed out of the court. Gon recovers moments after their victory, and Razor offers to tell him all he knows about Ging.[146] Gon challenges Genthru He tells the boy Ging is not on the island, and shares the story of how he inspired him. The NPC who told them about ""Plot of Beach"" leads them to the top of the lighthouse and, when the dawn rises, turns into the card while gazing out of the window. After Hisoka leaves, Goreinu and Tsezguerra content themselves withcopies, believing Gon deserves the original. The two then suggest a partnership to defeat Genthru. Just then, Genthru contacts Tsezguerra and reveals he killed all the members of Kazsule's alliance. Furious, Gon challenges him to a fight,[147]and Biscuit only barely manages to prevent him from revealing he has the original ""Plot of Beach"", which Genthru believes to be in Tsezguerra's possession. When the communication ends, Tsezguerra scolds Gon for his impulsiveness. He offers to buy them one week to heal their wounds and come up with a plan for free, and three in exchange for ""Wild Luck Alexandrite"".[148]Biscuit trains Gon to react with Gyo to Genthru'sLittle Flowerand attempts to hone his Emission skills enough to make them usable in combat.[149]Ten days later, he has made no significant progress in the latter,[150]and after five more days, Biscuit and Killua give him another strategy to rely on[151]and make him work on his timing until he can exactly tell when one minute has passed. Three weeks and five days after Tsezguerra began stalling the Bomber, his team is forced to retreat out of the game.[152] Gon faces off against Genthru The Bomber teleport to Gon's team, who pretend to be taken by surprise. They refuse to hand over their cards and flee to make the Bomber use up their movement spells until they manage to lead them in the desired location. The three split up, withSubtargeting Killua andBaragoing after Biscuit, leaving Gon to face Genthru by himself.[153]He counters his first offensive, which leads Genthru to realize he knows about his abilities. Before clashing again, he forces Genthru to agree that the winner will hand his cards over to the loser, declaring he would rather die than give his cards to a bandit. Gon is momentarily frightened by Genthru's superior aura output, and his attacks easily countered. However, Gon's pride as a warrior prohibits him from carrying out the plan until he manages to force Genthru to resort toLittle Flower. Genthru lands some solid blows.[154][155]Despite having the upper hand, Gon's stubbornness prompts him to useLittle Flowerto break his opponent's spirit.[156]Gon, however, manages to counter it with Gyo, which prompts Genthru to feint the technique twice. The first hit sends Gon reeling, but he sees through the second one, remembering Biscuit's warning. Genthru thus activates the ability from both hands. Ignoring Biscuit and Killua's words of caution again, Gon resolves to try out a new tactic.[157] Gon sacrifices his hands in order to win When Genthru grabs his wrists, Gon focuses only 30% of his aura in his right hand and 70% in his foot, and kicks an exposed Genthru on the chin at the same time that he sets offLittle Flower. Gon loses his left hand, and even his right is gravely injured, but he manages to bear the pain well enough to chargeRockwhile Genthru is stunned. His enemy trips over a root, which allows him to dodge Gon's punch. Satisfied, the boy accepts to proceed with the plan. He pulls a card out of his binder, which the Paladin's Necklace reverts toits true form, and warns Genthru he might die if he converts it. Genthru admits defeat and draws Gon close with a request. He swiftly crushes the boy's windpipe so he cannot dispel the binder and tries to knock him out, but Gon manages to counter the second strike. Enraged, he converts the card, soaking Genthru in gasoline to prevent him from usingLittle Flower.[158]While Genthru explainsCountdownto him so he can activate it as soon as he touches Gon, the boy pullsa second cardout of the binder and strikes the ground withRock, revealing a pitfall underneath. Both he and Genthru fall into it. Gon immediately jumps into a small side tunnel while the card reverts into a massive boulder that comes crashing down on Genthru.[159] Gon lands a devastating blow on Genthru The Bomber leaps into the tunnel, only to find himself trapped by the boulder and Gon chargingRockright in front of him. He tries to surrender, but Gon knocks him out. He contacts and meets up with Killua and Biscuit, and together they restrain the three Bomber and take their cards.[159]Gon's injuries are healed with ""Angel's Breath"". The trio also uses it on Genthru's teammates before it maxes out. They contact Goreinu to receive more copies, who however is unwilling to waste the card on three murderers. Gon activates his last copy, which prompts Goreinu to hand them his own, as well as all his and Tsezguerra's team's cards. Gon, Killua, and Biscuit also receive 1 billioneach as a result of Battera rescinding the contract. Gon places all 99 specified slot cards in his binder. An announcement goes off that alerts every player of a quiz test, the prize being the elusive ""Ruler's Blessing"". Multiple players teleport to the group's location, but only to offer them a deal.[160]Gon gives the most exact responses and receives ""Ruler's Invitation"".GashtaandZetsk Bellamattack him to get the card, but Gon's team easily defeat them.[161] Gon's plan to bring ""Accompany"" to the real world works Killua ""drifts"" toLimeiroso Gon and Biscuit can fly there too. Gon enters the castle, where he is greeted byList,[161]who takes him toDwun's dumpster of a room. TheGame Mastershares anecdotes of his past with Ging and gives Gon ""Ruler's Blessing"" as well as the container in which to transport three cards to the outside world. He then asks the boy if he wants the generic ending or the special one just for him, and Gon goes with the former, unaware that there is no alternate ending. After a majestic party, Gon, Killua, and Biscuit pick the three cards. The next morning Gon presents them toElena:[162]""Blue Planet"", ""Paladin's Necklace"", and ""Plot of Beach"". When the trio leave the game, Gon converts ""Paladin's Necklace"" to revert ""Plot of Beach"" into ""Accompany"", which he had previously transformed with ""Clone"", after finding out that the first contact on his list was not Goreinu, the person to enter the game after him, but an anagram of ""Ging"". He proclaims the first thing he will do after meeting his father is introduce Killua as his best friend, to the latter's embarrassment, and moving Biscuit to tears. They greet her before casting ""Accompany"", which takes Gon and Killua to Kite inKakin.[163]"
What does Gon need to do to get a learning certificate from the schooling and welfare office?,complete four semesters' worth of schoolwork,Succession contest arc,"Shortly after his conversation with Ging, Gon discovers he cannot use his aura.[235]Gon has a brief discussion with Ging over the phone about not being able to use aura, after which Ging suggested that Gon probably just can't see it because he has reverted back to ""normal"". Ging stated that since Gon ""threw it all away"" as one of the conditions to increase his power enough to beat Pitou, then surviving that ordeal should be more than enough, and to expect or ask for more would be audacious and for which he has to pay a price. Ging then suggested that this is the best time for Gon to take some time to discover and decide what he would like to do from now on, implying that he could remain a ""normal"" person or re-awaken his abilities and continue being a Hunter with a new goal.[236] Gon back on Whale Island Arriving on Whale Island, he is greeted joyously by his auntMitoandhis great-grandmother. Gon confesses while talking with Mito that he never really wanted to meet Ging, but simply wanted to ""find"" him. Inferring that Gon is now normal, Mito then takes out stacks of books and papers, telling Gon that he needs to complete four semesters' worth of schoolwork that he missed while he was gone adventuring as a Hunter to get a learning certificate from the schooling and welfare office. Furthermore, he also has to write 10,000 words of activities report of what he has done until now and 30 pages of the career record. This upsets Gon, but Mito reminds him that his status as a Hunter has granted him a number of exemptions involving his schoolwork and that the challenge of his make-up work pales in comparison to the many trials he's overcome.[236]"
What material is the fishing rod made out of?,metal,Equipment,"Gon's fishing rod Fishing Rod:Back in Whale Island, Gon used a telescopic fishing rod to practice his hobby of angling.[7]During the Hunter Exam, he showed the ability to use it as a makeshift weapon, striking the opponent from afar with its heavy float and grabbing faraway objects with the hook.[41]He carried it with him when he went to talk to Killua at the Zoldyck Mansion, but did not use it again until he fought Gido at Heavens Arena.[52]He then presumably left it at his house on Whale Island. Both the fishing rod and the wire are very durable, as they were used to lift and throw a 1-ton flagstone and did not snap. The float is heavy enough to leave a visible bruise on Hisoka's face when he was hit with it. The fishing rod is rather plain, being composed only of a handle and a rod, lacking any reel or guides. There are slight differences in its depiction in each media: in the manga, it is light brown in color, with white bandages wrapped around the handle; in the 1999 anime, the bandages are red-brown. The material it is made out of is unknown but was shown to be very durable and flexible. In the 2011 anime, the fishing rod is made out of metal and is silver, with dark gray bandages. When extended, it is taller than Gon, but its length decreases considerably when retracted. In the manga and both anime, Gon uses it in conjunction with a three-pronged hook and a big, spherical, red float. In the 1999 anime, this fishing rod was revealed by Mito to belong to Ging, who used it to catch a Master of the Swamp when he was a kid."
What does Gon do when he is a Hunter?,he thinks quickly for any alternative solutions and strategies,Abilities & powers,"Gon has all the benefits granted by his status as a Hunter. At the beginning of the series, he had a fishing rod that he could swing with baffling accuracy, even managing to catch Hisoka's tag from afar while the latter was moving at high speed. The fishing rod can also be used as an offensive weapon if the situation asks for it. During the Hunter Exam, Gon was often praised for his powers of observation, agility, and stamina. In battle, he thinks quickly for any alternative solutions and strategies. His most remarkable quality, however, is the uncanny, bottomless potential he is gifted with. Many powerful characters such asHisoka,Wing,Biscuit, andRazorwere left astounded when they grasped the full extent of Gon's talent, which is often described as being limitless. This allows him to learn extremely quickly, and that is true especially in the field of Nen, with an aptitude like his being very rare. Even prior to learning it, he managed to use Zetsu on one occasion. Together with his potential, it is his strength of mind that continuously leaves more experienced and skilled fighters dumbstruck, and is a crucial component of his overflowing charisma that causes even more powerful Hunters to gravitate towards him. His indomitable will allows him to continuously put his life on the line without being held back by fear, which in turn allows him to take chances others would never dare. As an Enhancer, he should be fairly balanced between offense and defense, but he prefers to go on the offensive, as his stubbornness tends to come out during combat. Because of it, he sometimes charges in recklessly, but at the same time doesn't give up until he can't move anymore. He is quite proficient in close combat after being trained in the basics of Shingen-ryukung fuby Wing and Biscuit, as well as through natural experience. Although this quality often goes unnoticed, Gon can focus intensely even in the direst circumstances, noticing details even starred Hunters would miss.[211] Other abilities include sleeping with a larger part of his brain awake than normal, thanks to Biscuit's training, and holding his breath for some minutes even if fatigued. After leaving Greed Island, due to his prowess in Nen, Gon became able to blend with nature more easily, which allowed him to find multiple new species of animals at a rate that astoundedKite's companions.[164] Enhanced Vision:Gon's eyesight exceeds that of a normal human. He was able to spot several examinees in the woods from the top of a tree, a feat that Kurapika judged impossible by human standards.[42]He can spot details so small he was able to tell two Kiriko apart , as well as their sex, which Kurapika and Leorio failed to do even after the reveal. He could also see and chase one of them in almost complete darkness based on a silhouette.[20] Enhanced Hearing:Gon's sense of hearing is even superior to his vision, and allows him to fight even in pitch-black darkness. He can hear the sound of a bat's wing cutting through the air and determine its position.[196]He can also detect differences in pitch that most other humans would be unable to perceive.[20]During the Hunter Exam, it allowed him to sense Geretta's presence.[37]He managed to sense Latarza fly towards him and Killua long before his companion.[108] Enhanced Taste:Since taste is vital to surviving in the woods,[1]Gon trained his tongue to the point he can detect substances that are considered tasteless.[21] Immense Smell:Gon's sense of smell is extremely advanced, causing him to be often compared to a dog.[165]He was able to track down Leorio by the scent of his cologne from several miles away.[25]He could also locate Ponzu, despite having not met her before, with the simple information she used chemical weapons.[42] Gon sensing Hisoka's bloodlust Preternatural Perception:Through no rational process, Gon was able to determineMajtaniwas not a threat without having ever fought before, a sensation he described as a ""chill"".[33]However, his inexperience[53]prevented him from making more accurate estimations, which in fact were often rectified by Killua.[53][80][83]His instincts became sharper after gaining more battle experience and improving his Nen abilities.[139][180]Like other perceptive fighters, Gon is capable of detecting the gazes of others.[107][126]He was able to sense Meleoron's presence despite the latter specializing in erasing it.[198] Gon kicking a Phantom Troupe member Enhanced Strength:Prior to the Hunter Exam, Gon was able to effortlessly transport aMaster of the Swampwhile running, a fish so heavy that five grown men could not land it by pulling together.[7]After training for 20 days at theZoldyck Family's estate, he became capable of pushing a gate weighing 4 tons open, as well as of shattering rock pillars with a punch[50]and sending opponents several times his size than him crashing into a wall a few dozen meters away by pushing with just one hand.[53]Later on, at Heavens Arena, he proved strong enough to lift[64]and throw[65]the ring's stone tiles without effort, snap a metal rod in two with a punch,[64]and break a Nen user's wrists in a split second just by grabbing them.[65]He was able to beatShizuku, ranked 12th in the Phantom Troupe, in arm-wrestling,[73]and once also Nobunaga, ranked ninth, while using Ren.[10]It is unknown how much he can press after learning Nen, but the power of hisRockhas shown to terrorize even experienced Nen users.[180][193]With the same attack, he was allegedly able to blasta Chimera Antto another country.[197] Enhanced Speed and Reflexes:During the Hunter Exam Gon regarded his speed as his primary asset in combat, earning Hanzo's praise despite being slower than him.[44]His quickness enabled him to dodge some of Hisoka's attacks as well as surprise him for a moment.[66]Despite Hisoka proving faster than him, Gon was nonetheless able to follow his movements with his eyes.[68]On Greed Island, he was able to cover a distance of several meters and steal a card from a weak Nen user's hand before the latter could notice.[113]Coupled with his superhuman eyesight, Gon's quick reflexes allow him to always win at rock-paper-scissors by looking at the opponent's fist right before the throw.[111]He was able to see through the last stage of Gotoh's coin game, whereas Leorio and Kurapika were not able to follow his movements at all,[52]as well as follow Razor's passes[140]and throws,[141]unlike Single-Star Hunter Tsezguerra.[140]Through Biscuit's training, Gon ended up becoming Killua's equal in both running speed[119]and reactions,[122]despite initially being slower.[121]His cruising speed is such that he can leave horses in the dust and keep up with Kite,[168]and eventually to trade blows evenly with Knuckle, although his movement speed remained lower than the Beast Hunter's.[13]Gon is also a fast climber, taking about 20 minutes to climb up the irregular surface of a tree 1784 meters high after the first 500 meters.[233] Enhanced Agility:Gon can run and jump from one tree to another with such agility he easily caught up with a Kiriko.[20]He has a vertical leap of a few meters,[28]which he can increase to over 16 meters by using Nen.[138]In combat, he can use his agility to strike from unexpected angles and to find his balance quickly after taking a hit or dodging.[66] Enhanced Stamina:Gon was able to complete a long-distance run more than 80 kilometers long, and taking place on uneven terrains such as ascending stairs and a swamp,[22]without exhibiting the slightest sign of fatigue.[25]In his first match against Gido, he kept dodging 50 spinning tops for about one hour while in a state of Zetsu.[60]He fought Binolt for 10 days straight while keeping his guard up even as he slept.[9]He was also noted to recover from exhaustion very rapidly.[120] Gon sacrifices his arms to hit Genthru Immense Endurance:Gon has shown to be able to keep fighting even while in tremendous pain. This is mostly due to his obstinacy and determination more than to a physical predisposition. He did not surrender after three hours of Hanzo hitting him with specialist knowledge[44]or when the shinobi broke his arm.[45]He could withstand having his right arm severely scorched and his left one blown off by Genthru[158]after taking a beating from him[155]and later having his windpipe crushed,[158]and managed to chargeRocktwice and win nonetheless.[158][159] Enhanced Adaptability:He talked and laughed on top of theWorld Treefor many hours without looking troubled by the low oxygen level or temperature.[233][234] Enhanced Poison Resistance:WhenGerettaparalyzed him during the Hunter Exam, he claimed that Gon would be unable to move for 10 days, whereas Hisoka believed that four would suffice; however, Gon stood back up minutes after the poison had taken effect.[41] Healing Factor:Gon heals extremely quickly. This fact is not only thanks to his being an Enhancer since there have been instances of it happening even before he learned Nen, such as when his broken arm healed completely from a clean fracture in 10 days.[49]After Wing opened his aura nodes, Gon made a full recovery from a broken radius and ulna, a cracked humerus, three rib fractures and 12 cracks[60]in one month instead of the predicted four,[61]all the while without using Nen.[60]When Genthru blew off his left hand, the bleeding stopped instantaneously.[158] Keen Intellect:Gon has often astounded allies and opponents alike with his astounding ability to think outside the box, finding a new perspective with which to look at a problem to solve it.[36]He demonstrated this ability twice during the Third Phase of the Hunter Exam, blowing out Sedokan's candle instead of looking after his own,[32]and choosing the long path to the goal only to break down the wall separating it from the short one, sidestepping Lippo's forced choice.[36]Instead of fighting Nobunaga, he applied his knowledge of ostomy to find an alternative way of escaping.[83]He was also the one who suggested Killua and he auction off items to raise a profit before attending the auction themselves as buyers,[71]and later that they seek to be hired byBatterainstead of purchasing Greed Island.[99]He also has a good memory, which allowed him to win the quiz to obtain ""Ruler's Blessing"".[161]He is also fairly intuitive[105]and, when fully focused, has occasionally shown the ability to think faster than the likes of Killua and Morel through cutting out everything that is not relevant.[237]He is, however, notoriously inept at math.[48][13] Proficient Strategist:Gon's exceptional capacity for lateral thinking extends to battle tactics, making him wholly unpredictable. He managed to surprise Netero three times during their ball game.[28][29]He devised simple but effective strategies to defeat Gido and Riehlvelt using his surroundings,[64][65]and resorted to a similar method to land a punch on Hisoka.[66]He devised the plan that allowed Kurapika to abduct Chrollo.[94]His willingness to take significant damage to land a critical hit would have allowed him to defeat Genthru without relying on Killua's plan had the latter not been saved by a fortuitous coincidence.[158]Against Hollow and Bat he displayed decent analytical skills, identifying the mechanics behind their coordinated attacks and turning them against the duo.[196] Gon, matching Knuckle blow-by-blow Proficient Hand-to-Hand Combatant:Gon was schooled inShingen-ryukung fucombat techniques by Wing for about one month,[64]and received further instructions from Killua before his match against Hisoka.[6]Despite his limited training, he proved time and time again to be a competent, extremely crafty brawler. After 10 days of relentless fighting against Binolt,[9]he was able to spar with Killua on equal ground while using Ryu both through theFlowing Dance, in which practitioners must share a similar level of similar skill,[121]and at full speed.[122]His prowess at close quarters surprised Genthru and Hisoka, although he was outmatched in both cases.[66][154]After the Bomber crushed his windpipe, Gon accurately predicted he would go for the back of his neck next and focused his aura there, showing the ability to anticipate his opponents without seeing them.[158]Killua noted that he improves at a tremendous rate when in real combat situations. In just 20 days, Gon managed to significantly reduce the gap between himself and Knuckle,[185]a veteran of over 5,000 battles[212]who employs unarmed combat as his main means of offense. Gon's fighting style is punch-based, often including flurries of blows[13][197]and his unpredictable tactics[66][197]as well as the occasional kick when the position makes it more convenient.[66][154] Proficient Weapon Specialist:Gon has shown to be adept at using his fishing rod both as a club[20]and a whip-like weapon .[24]He is so skilled that he can grab distant objects with the hook, his highest accomplishment being managing to steal Hisoka's tag despite the latter's speed and keen senses.[41]At Heavens Arena, Gon has used his fishing rod to lift a flagstone to stop Gido's spinning.[64] Stealth Expert:Gon managed to tail Hisoka for a whole day without being detected.[81]His aptitude at concealing his presence is an entirely natural skill, which was not achieved through any form of training, but rather his continuous being in contact with the wilderness.[59]Unbeknownst to him, this feat was rendered possible by his unwitting use of Zetsu as well as by his intents being drowned out by Hisoka's own bloodlust.[41] Skilled Fisherman:At the age of 10, Gon managed to catch the Swamp King, a fish that nobody had been able to hook for years.[7] Zoological Knowledge:Gon is very knowledgeable about several orders and species of animals[169][190]and, to a lesser extent, plants,[1]partly due to his living on Whale Island. This expertise proved particularly useful against the Chimera Ants.[195][196]However, he appears to lack even basic knowledge concerning Magical Beasts.[20] Animal Empathy:Gon has managed to forge a bond with aFoxbearcubdespite them usually not allowing humans to tame them, and the two even became friends in later years, with each comprehending what the other was trying to communicate.[7]When he left to take the Hunter Exam, he told theCaptainhe knew a storm was coming partially because the seagulls had told him so.[18]Being liked by animals is a characteristic that is often attributed to good Hunters,[180]and indeed his proficiency in Nen made it easier for him to melt into nature and use his five senses to the fullest, which resulted in him discovering new animal species.[164]However, he was unable to form a bond with Mike, as he himself immediately understood upon looking into his eyes.[49]"
How many advanced techniques does Gon have?,at least five,Nen,"Gon discovers Shu Gon is anEnhancerand is thus endowed with great strength and recuperative abilities.[6]Thanks to Biscuit's training he has trained in at least two other Nen types,EmissionandTransmutation, which he later honed to a high enough level to create workingNen abilities. Originally, he exhibited greater skills in Emission than in Transmutation,[126]but by the time he met Kite in NGL, he might have become more proficient in the latter category than in the former, as suggested by the combat potential of his Nen abilities.[171][186]Gon has also mastered the four basic techniques[6]and at least five of the advanced ones .[187]According to Wing, Gon's talent can be found only in one out of ten million people.[6]He performedTensuccessfully with next to no instructions, a feat which Wing described as both ""amazing"" and ""terrifying"",[57]and learned Ren andGyoin only one night.[63]In normal conditions, he was able to maintain Ren for three hours outside of combat without the slightest difficulty.[16]With this technique he could pulverize objects strengthened with aura thrown at him bya fellow Enhancereven in the early stages of his training.[64]When trying to develop a Nen ability, he discovered the advanced techniqueKoon his own after Wing suggested he show Tsezguerra all he had learned at the same time,[104]and he can deploy it swiftly and on multiple body parts simultaneously.[141]Likewise, he learned to useShusimply by imagining the technique, and he succeeded on the first try.[119]This means that together withZetsu, which he managed to utilize before even being introduced to the concept of Nen,[59]this feat qualifies him as agenius in Nen. Gon was able to discover three out of eleven techniques by himself. Although he was strictly a novice in that regard, he had some basic skills in reading the opponent's aura flow[185]and estimating the amount deployed.[121] Outside of Nen abilities, Gon's proficiency in Enhancement manifested chiefly in his extraordinary durability. He took a severe beating from Genthru,[155]surviving attacks to areas he barely guarded with aura,[157][158]whereas Killua reckoned that a single direct attack fromSub, anotherBomber, would put him out of commission.[156]Baro, whose rolling attack could fell a thick tree, failed to inflict significant damage despite Gon being caught off guard.[173]Not evenHollow, a fellow Nen user, was able to inflict the lightest wound with his feathers[196]or multiple blows[197]despite being strong enough to casually knock down a tree with one punch and to redirect Gon'sPaperby throwing a rock.[196]Conversely, Gon's own attacks were strong enough to rattle Hisoka's and Genthru's arm when they blocked one of his kicks[66][154]in spite of their superior expertise in Nen. Killua once struck him with Ryu or Ko from behind[176]and without holding back[177]while Gon was using Ken;[176]Gon lost consciousness, but came to only a few hours later with no lasting damage or injury.[177] Gon's anger-fueled aura While Killua was generally regarded as the one with the best control of his aura out of the two, Gon was often praised by foes and allies alike for the great quantity of it he was able to release. According to Knuckle, the sheer size of Gon's aura duringKenwas comparable to that of a mid-ranking pro[184].[13]Combined with his skills in Enhancement, Gon's Hatsu technique, which boasted an even greater output , exceeded Knuckle's defensive abilities, as the latter was knocked out by it.[180]Such formidable output prompted Razor to call Gon a ""monster"".[145]However, his lack of experience made his aura flow easy to read,[184]and caused him to waste a lot of energy ,[13]particularly when he used Emission.[13]Kite described Gon as a ""slow starter"", viewing this trait as a weakness.[174]On the other hand, Gon's main strength consisted in his ability to increase his aura output during a fight.[184]This process was largely unconscious and depended heavily on his mental state. Determination[145]and anger,[193]in particular, granted him incredible boosts. The increase in power used to be so great that an enraged Gon'sRockmight have been able to kill Morel,[193]a seasoned Hunter with nearly three times his total aura,[212]whereas before the same attack caused Knuckle to faint, but no lasting injury.[180]Meleoron also believes that Gon'sRock, in conjunction with hisPerfect Plan, is powerful enough to kill an off-guard Meruem by targeting one of the King's vitals, although the credibility of this can be questionable.[238]When he and Killua prepared to fight Neferpitou in theRoyal Palace of East Gorteau, Killua stated that he had never seen his friend give off such a strong aura, leading him to believe that not even the Royal Guard could oppose him without using Nen.[217] Gon, launching a ball withRock His Nen ability was calledJajanken a play on the Japanese word for rock-paper-scissors ""Janken"", and the word ""Jajan"" .[184]Gon first got the idea after learning the dangerous roots of the game within martial arts.Jajankenconsisted of three parts. Gon's main attack wasRock, a simple but devastating punch concentrating all his aura into his fist through Ko. His long-ranged attack wasPaper, an emitted attack that fires a ball of aura from his palm; this used to be his weakest attack, the ball being somewhat slow, not that powerful and easy to block or change course for someone using Ko.[186]His mid-ranged attack wasScissors, a transmuted blade of aura attached to his index and middle fingers, capable of slicing through a Chimera Ant.[171]Gon prefaced each attack with the chant ""First comes rock! Rock, paper..."" , which was followed by the name of the attack. Since all three attacks were charged the same way, Gon could decide to switch from one to another even after the preparations started, in order to adapt should the opponent come closer or back away.[185]Later on, he became capable of chargingJajankeneven while running.[197] The long charging time madeJajankendifficult to use in actual combat, although the risks it posed were at the core of its power.[13]Nevertheless, through a technique called""Round 2"", Gon was capable of mustering twice the normal amount of aura so as to use twoJajankenattacks in quick succession, eliminating the need to perform the chant twice.[186][13]The name of this technique was shouted after the first attack and immediately before the second.[186]It is currently unclear whetherRound 2was a Nen ability proper or simply a loophole inJajanken. After the siege on the palace, through a Contract,[239]Gon sacrificed all of his inborn talents in order to gain immense power,[227]with which he managed to single-handedly defeat one of the Royal Guards. He used this ability without any prior training, the only knowledge on Vows he possessed at the time deriving from Kurapika's explanation of his Nen ability. However, as a result, his body started to decay soon after the fight, and even after being wished back to full health, Gon lost the capacity to use or perceive his aura.[235]Gingcryptically stated Gon has only been turned back to ""normal"" and should consider himself lucky as he could have lost a lot more.[236]Whether or not he can re-acquire his Nen is currently unknown."

What color is Killua's hair?,white,Appearance,"Killua has spiky white hair, very pale skin, and blue eyes. His eyes change shape depending on his mood, narrowing and sharpening when he goes into assassination mode. Killua is fairly lean at the start of the series, due to constant physical conditioning and torture training he received when he was young. During the Chimera Ant Arc, he becomes more muscular and toned. In the 1999 anime adaptation, Killua's eyes are green. He is also often seen holding a green skateboard . Killua typically wears baggy clothing, usually a dark-coloredturtleneck. In the manga and 2011 anime adaptation, Killua wears long, baggy shorts, but the 1999 anime adaptation character design shortened them to end above his knees. Killua also wears purple boots, recolored brown and black in the 1999 anime adaptation. Killua's hair was longer as a child, almost to his shoulders. He wore a hoodie with his trademark blue coloring, grey pants, and shoes."
What is Killua's favorite snack?,chocolate,Personality,"Killua's love for sweets Killua is introduced as a character similar to Gon: cheeky, cheerful, and full of mischievous ideas. However, contrasting Gon's politeness, Killua can be quite rude to others, mostly strangers and older people. He is known for having a sweet tooth; he loves everything sweet and spent almost200 million on snacks when he was first at theHeavens Arena. His favorite snack is chocolate, specifically Chocolate Balls and Chocolate Robots. He is one of the quickest-thinking characters and often analyzes a situation with great ease and accuracy. In spite of his young age, his has an adult-like way of thinking, knowledge, and pragmatism. He is initially very confident in his own abilities, seen questioning Gon's capability during their Hunter Exam and comparing his strength with others. Over time, Killua becomes more humble and is no longer seen touting his abilities. He is not a very open person; despite his advanced knowledge and level-headed nature, he becomes very embarrassed when Gon openly calls him his best friend or compliments him about their bond. Despite his horrendous upbringing and the torturous training his family has put him under, Killua has managed to remain generally positive and seems relatively unaffected by the pain, demonstrating a noble, pure side of him. When showcasing his ability to turn his Nen into electricity, both Netero and Biscuit note how tragic his childhood must have been for him to endure the constant exposure to electricity, the latter stating that it's a miracle Killua is even able to smile at all. Killua's bloodlust Killua's ruthlessness and aptitude in killing show the other side of him—deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. This side fades as he spends more time with Gon, although he remains unafraid to threaten or kill anyone who threatens or attacks him or those close to him, especially Gon or Alluka. Conflicting with Killua's predisposal to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his friends and natural kindness. He claims Gon was his first friend, and grows progressively more attached to him as time passes. Killua often suffers without complaint in his attempts to help his friends. He puts others before himself without being concerned about his own health or even his life. Killua's fear of his brother Until recently, Killua's greatest flaw was his fear of those he perceived as stronger than him . Killua had been trained as an assassin by his brother to be extremely cautious and to only engage in combat with certain victory, and to run away even at the slightest disadvantage. This impeded him as a Hunter, and Biscuit attempts to correct that by explaining that victory is never certain, and that depending on the circumstances, a person has the possibility of defeating stronger opponents.[7] Killua especially struggles with these dueling ideologies during the latter half of the series, as he begins to encounter stronger opponents. His brother's teachings remained firmly entrenched in his mind, to the point that Biscuit prophesied that he would one day abandon Gon because of this. Biscuit's prophecy would resound when he encountered a Chimera Ant while watching over a temporarily-Nenless, defenseless Gon. At the last moment, Killua realized that Illumi had implanted a needle in his brain, which forced Killua to retreat whenever in battle without certain victory. Killua would then extract the needle and free himself from his brother's influence whenever he faced a decision on whether or not to flee from an unclear situation.[8] Killua's gambling problem During the events of Greed Island, Killua has shown to be highly susceptible to gambling, even risking his life for a big slot machine reward, only stopping when Biscuit physically hit him. During the events of the Chimera Ant arc, Killua demonstrates great maturity in thinking and controlling his emotions, able to recall his instructions even when suddenly facing a far superior opponent with an injured ally, in sharp contrast to Gon who immediately gets angry and blindly seeks revenge without considering his inferior capabilities. Outside of his older brother Illumi, Killua does not seem to hate or fear any other Zoldyck; he respects his father Silva and his grandfather Zeno, finds his mother Kikyo annoying,[9]and has a relatively normal brother relationship with Milluki, seen helping each other at times.[10]Killua later turns against his family after realizing that an exchange he had with Silva was Silva gently disguising his approval of Illumi attempting to kill Alluka.[9]"
How old was Killua when he was forced by Silva to battle in the martial arts tournament at the Heavens Arenauntil he reached the 200thfloor?,Six,Background,"Six-year-old Killua playing Killua was born in theRepublic of Padokea*[3]and is the middle child of a family of known assassins, theZoldycks. Showing great promise from birth, Killua followed the traditional Zoldyck training, which was imparted to him bySilva,KikyoandIllumi.[11]He had already mastered many killing techniques at a tender age and was set to be one of the best assassins the family had ever produced.[12]At the age of three, he started training in tailing that routinely put his life at risk.[13] At a young age, he fulfilled three ofAlluka's requests, causingNanikato take over. He asked her how to revert the change, and it explained its powers to him. He decided to keep it a secret from their parents, who were however informed byMitsubaafter she witnessed one episode.SilvaandKikyoquestioned him about it, and he relayed what Nanika told him, adding that refusing four demands resulted in death only after Mitsuba is killed.[14] At the age of six, he was forced by Silva to battle in the martial arts tournament at theHeavens Arenauntil he reached the 200thfloor, after which he was allowed to return home.[15]It took him two months to reach the 150thfloor,[16]and a total of two years to get to the 200th.[15] Killua meeting Canary When he was six or seven, he mastered the game of darts as part of basic training.[17]Around the age of nine, he met and attempted to befriend the newly hiredCanary. She thanked him for the thought, but, due to their different status, she declined his offer to be friends.[12] At an unknown point in his life, his family determined he lacked the mindset of a real assassin and had Illumi implant a special needle in his head to subliminally remodel his character through fear,[18]as well as to prevent him from freeing Alluka from her playroom.[14] About three years before the events of the Yorknew City arc, Killua and his brothers were summoned by their father, who, having just assassinated member #8 of the Phantom Troupe for a price deemed not worthy of the job , admonished them to stay away from the Troupe.[19] Sick of killing, at the age of 11 he rebelled against his family, injuringhis motherandolder brother, and ran away from home to take the Hunter Exam for fun.[20]By that time, he had already assassinated more people than theBomber combined.[21]"
Who knocks out Zushi?,Killua,Heavens arena arc,"Killua knocks out Zushi Killua confronts Gon about his future plans and makes him understand he needs to train if he wants to stand a chance at landing a blow on Hisoka. They fly to the Heavens Arena, where they can train and earn money at the same time. Gon is called to fight right after registering, and Killua tells him to simply push his opponent, since he has opened the first door of the Testing Gate, which allows him to launch his opponent out of bounds. Killua makes quick work of his own adversary. Instead of heading directly to the 180thfloor, he contents himself with the 50th, as he wants to advance with Gon.[15]They meet a fellow fighter, a young boy namedZushi, and his teacher,Wing. The three collect their prize:152 each, the prize of a drink. Killua blows Gon's and Zushi's minds by listing the rewards for clearing upper floors, and by revealing he squandered the money he had made in sweets. The three wait for the announcement of their next matches in the locker room. Killua and Zushi are pitted against each other. To Killua's irritation, Zushi is made out to be the front runner. Killua determines him not to be a threat and leisurely walks to him. He swiftly dodges Zushi's punch and strikes him in the neck from behind, earning two points. Surprisingly, Zushi gets up, unscathed. Killua repeats the attack with more power, but Zushi recovers immediately, awarding him only one point. While Killua is bewildered by his resilience, Zushi takes a fighting stance that terrifies him, reminding him of Illumi. Wing yells at his pupil, causing Zushi to rescind the technique.[46] Wing shows Gon and Killua his Ren The match continues as before, with Killua scoring point after pointing without managing to KO his opponent. Frustrated, Killua hits Zushi with his real power, throwing him out of the ring. His fear of causing lasting damage is however replaced by amazement when Zushi staggers back up, only lightly affected.[16]Killua is declared the winner. As he leaves the arena, he eavesdrops on Zushi apologizing to Wing, who scolds him for usingRenbefore the 200thfloor. To Gon, Killua confesses that he felt from Zushi vibes similar to those his brother gave off in their confrontation. Wanting to find out more about it, he proclaims he and Gon are shooting for the top.[46]They soon reach the 100thfloor, getting their own rooms. Killua warns Gon they might meet real contenders, but the boy defeats his opponents without difficulty. They easily advance to the 150thfloor, where a discussion about Zushi renews Killua's interest in Ren. He comes up with a contrived plan to find out more, but Gon points out they could simply ask Zushi. His explanation, however, is incomprehensible to them. Wing warns them against acquiring incomplete knowledge, to which Killua responds his brother is probably a student ofNentoo. Killua requests a lecture, so Wing takes him and Gon to his hotel room. There, he proceeds to demonstrate theNen of the Flame. He asks Killua if he can kill him, who responds he lacks the power to do so. After going through the first two steps, Wing states he will kill Killua and unleashes his Ren, causing a frightened Killua to jump back.[16] After Wing finishes his explanation, Gon and Killua leave. Killua is certain that Wing lied, as both his power and Zushi's impossible resistance to injury were real. Not much later, the two qualify for the 200thfloor.[16]At around 8:10 p.m. they exit the elevator, but a wall of bloodlust prevents them from walking down the hallway to the registration desk. When Killua yells at the perpetrator to come out,a clerkturns the corner and informs them their eligibility expires at midnight. Hisoka then shows himself and pushes them further back with another wave of bloodlust, declaring they are not ready to fight on that floor yet. Despite his protests, Killua is unable to advance and cannot figure out why. Wing appears behind the two boys and offers to teach them the real Nen. The clerk informs Killua that if he does not register by midnight, due to having failed to do so once before he will be barred from all further combat. Killua asks Wing if they can be back by midnight, to which the teacher replies it is up to them.[47] Killua and Gon get through Hisoka's barrier In Wing's room, he demonstrates the real Nen and tells them they must masterTenlest their bodies are destroyed by malicious Nen attacks.[47]He states there are two methods to awaken Nen, an orthodox one that would require six months, and an improper one that would jolt their Aura Nodes open on the spot, forcing them to learn Ten in minutes lest they pass out. Killua wonders why Wing suddenly decided to teach them, to which he replies that everyone on the 200thfloor can use Nen and will forcefully ""initiate"" anyone who does not know it. He opens their Aura Nodes and, after a few seconds of panic, Gon and Killua manage to contain the leaking aura. Wing activates his Ren and directs it at them until they manage to cross the barrier of bloodlust, after which they return to the Heavens Arena and pass through Hisoka's. Right afterward, they are confronted by three fighters:Gido,Sadaso, andRiehlvelt.[48]Gon and Killua rush to the registration desk, where they do not respond to the clerk's enthusiasm about the prizes. Killua realizes that Gido, Sadaso, and Riehlvelt want to pick a fight on the same day as Gon to get an easy win, and Gon gives them the liberty to choose. They receive new rooms and discover Gon's match is scheduled for the following day, March 11th, against Gido.[49] Killua spectates at the match in person and yells at Gon to wait for Gido to get dizzy when he usesTornado Top. He becomes deeply concerned about his friend when he cancels Ten.[50]Gon is eventually defeated, suffering multiple bone fractures. The following day, he chastises Gon for his recklessness. Wing arrives moments later to rebuke him as well, and Killua lies about how long it will take for Gon's injuries to heal. Wing thus forbids Gon from training in Nen for two months. He speaks to Killua in private, enquiring about their goals. Killua claims not to have any interest in Battle Olympia but claims he cannot speak for Gon since he was clearly enjoying his match. He admits he is like him at times, only that he knows how to pick his battles. He assures the teacher Gon is not going to break his promise a second time. Sensing his regret, Killua asserts they would have learned Nen anyway and refuses to resume his training until Gon can too. He returns to Gon's room to inform him that Wing has authorized him to practice the Ten of the Flame, but finds him already performing it and joins him.[51] Killua with tickets for Hisoka's match One month later he books tickets for Hisoka's match againstKastro. When he goes to Gon's room, he is shocked to see his friend has already made a full recovery. He updates him on the magician's track record, noticing that despite claiming to be scared, Gon looks eager to fight him. Wing, however, forbids Gon from seeing the match. Killua sees part of Kastro's interview and decides to check if he has a reason to be as self-assured as he sounds. He activatesZetsuand easily gets past security. He glimpses Kastro sitting in a chair, then a voice causes him to turn around, and he sees Kastro standing behind him. He pretends he is a fan who wants an autograph, but Kastro recognizes him and enquires about his impression of him. Killua concedes he seems indeed powerful. Kastro returns the compliment, warning him to activate Zetsu when he is further away. Killua asks him how he managed to be in two places at once, to which Kastro responds that he cannot tell a potential opponent, seeing through Killua's lie that he no longer intends to fight at the Heavens Arena, then specifies the match will give him the answer. As soon as the match begins, Killua notices an irregularity with Kastro's attacks.[52]He recognizes hisTiger Bite Fistand, when Hisoka figures out the nature of hisdoubleability, Killua thinks that his initial impression that for a moment two Kastro had appeared was correct.[53]Like the rest of the audience, he is confused and appalled by Hisoka's grisly show, which allows him to kill his opponent.[54] One month later, Killua and Gon reprise their training under Wing. The two are mesmerized by thepromise string, after which Killua asks Wing what Hisoka's ability is. He plays the tape for them and states the magician used strands of aura, but his students are unable to see them. He tells them Hisoka is concealing them withIn, and tasks Gon and Killua with practicing Ren until they can see them throughGyo. He authorizes them to fight on their last available day, which for Killua is June 9th. After Gon, Killua, and Zushi leave Wing's room, they decide to head to Killua's to revise what they learned. On the elevator, they sense Gido, Riehlvelt, and Sadaso awaiting them. Killua is annoyed by their persistence and leads his friends away from them.[55]Having sensed Sadaso's intentions, after they are finished with practice, Killua shadows Zushi, who is knocked unconscious by the Newbie Hunter. He steps out, offering to take Gon's place and give a win to each of the three. After registering, he warns them not to play dirty again but trails off before threatening them. As he carries Zushi away, he thinks to himself that it is difficult to live without killing.[56] Sadaso threatened by Killua That night he learns Gyo and the following day, he discovers that Gon was blackmailed too. He pretends to have found Zushi asleep on the steps and has Wing play the tape for him, managing to see all 15 strands of aura and correctly guessing their properties. Since both Gon and Killua have achieved a good working command of the technique, their teacher allows them to fight earlier than agreed, so Killua picks May 29th, the date of his scheduled fight against Sadaso, pretending it is his birthday. Later, he and Gon discuss the treachery of their three opponents, and Killua asserts they will never do anything of the sort again. On the day of his match, ten minutes before the start, he appears in Sadaso's dressing room and threatens to kill him if he ever shows up before him or Gon again. Killua is thus declared winner by withdrawal.[56]After Sadaso, who has left the Heavens Arena for good, informs Gido and Riehlvelt, the latter speculates Killua did not come to them because he does not know their abilities. Killua makes his presence manifest, maintaining that he simply knew he could warn them at any time. He recommends they respect the rules.[57] Killua stops Riehlvelt's whips He and Gon keep training and on June 4th, Killua observes Gon's match against Gido, taking note of his friend's fury, and later confronts Riehlvelt.[57]As soon as the signal is given, Killua leaps up, attempting a sneak attack, but jumps too high and Riehlvelt escapes withAura Burst. The latter pulls out his whips and tries to push Killua out of the ring with ""Song of Defense"", but Killua easily catches them, which result in his electrocution. Unfazed, Killua flings his opponent high in the air, revealing that he can withstand electric shocks, and asks a plunging Riehlvelt if he wants him to catch him. Riehlvelt begs him to, so Killua complies while holding onto his electric whips, knocking him out. After the match, he cautions Gon about the electricity, to which the boy responds he has already come up with a plan. Killua gets another win after Gido forfeits and watches Gon's fight with Riehlvelt.[58] Killua's Water Divination The following day Wing introduces his students toHatsu. ThroughWater Divination, Killua is revealed to be aTransmuter. After one month, Killua and Gon hone their Hatsu to the point that Wing announces they have mastered the basics. He tells Killua that he will pass the Hunter Exam without problems should he attempt it again.[6]The following day, he spectates Gon's fight against Hisoka, thinking that Hisoka's awareness of his superiority cause shi to be careless.[59]When Hisoka shares thecharacter traitsassociated withEnhancersand Transmuters, Killua reflects that he is correct. He is shocked when Hisoka gives Gon a sample of his real power, and realizes he has attachedBungee Gum, although only after the fact,[60]as well as the difficulty of avoiding the ability. After the match, Killua and Gon pack up and set off toWhale Island.[61]"
What is the name of Gon's first friend?,Killua,Yorknew city arc,"Gon suggests they stay together As soon as they arrive at Gon's house,Mitobrings them into line. After a hearty lunch, the two boys explore the forest. Gon takes Killua to the place where he metKiteand comes upon a welcome back gift left byKon. When night falls, as they stargaze Killua reflects that, unlike Gon, he does not have a goal, only things he does not want to do. Gon embarrasses him by exclaiming Killua is his first friend his age, but after a moment he reciprocates. He agrees to travel around with Gon until he finds something he wants to do. He then enquires about Gon's birth mother, to which the boy replies Mito is his only mother. They head back[62]and Killua falls asleep while Gon and Mito talk aboutGingdownstairs. In the morning, he tries unsuccessfully to twist the iron box left by Ging open. He suggests Gon try using Nen, and the metal casing breaks, revealing aninscriptionlike the one on Wing's promise string on its components. Gon opens the next box with his Hunter's license. They find three items inside: a cassette tape, a ring, and a memory card. Before they listen to the tape, Killua recommends setting the stereo to record.[63] Killua calls Milluki The recorded voice turns out to be Ging's, who challenges Gon to find him. He stops the tape before learning anything about his biological mother. After that, the tape begins rewinding itself and the stereo records over it. Killua tries to stop it by breaking it, but Ging's aura prevents him from doing any damage. In the end, both tapes are erased, which Killua understands to be a way for Ging to cover his tracks, particularly against trackingNen abilities. They focus on the memory card next, which Killua identifies as belonging to aJoyStation.[64]He orders one for same-day shipping. All 30 slots of the memory card turn out to be used up by a game called ""Greed Island"". Killua copies the save files before looking into the game, which is out of production. He discovers it is for Hunters only and it is sold at exorbitant prices. When they cannot find any used copies and, after posting an ad, only receive a series of scam offers, Killua phones Milluki for information on the game, trading him for a copy of the memory card. Milluki advises him to look it up on the Hunters' website and tells him copies of the game will be auctioned off at theSouthernpiece Auction. He prevents Gon from using his Hunter license on his home computer.[65] Gon and Killua reach Yorknew City When they receive theHunter Website's URL, they log in from an internet café. After paying a fee they learn that Greed Island was created by Nen users, that players are transported into it, and that seven copies will be auctioned off in Yorknew City. They try to find valuable loot to sell so they can participate to the auction until their differences of opinions turn their money-raising attempts into a competition.[66]Killua manages to raise286 million before a gamble leaves him penniless, causing him to lose the competition. As they roam a market, Killua talks Gon into buying himself a phone. They are assisted by Leorio, who brings down the price of a better model.[67]In their hotel room they discuss how to proceed regarding the Southernpiece Auction. Killua observes that something that can be bought is not real treasure, which Leorio and Gon oppose. Leorio comes up with the idea of creating a conditional auction based on arm-wrestling, where contenders pay a fee to challenge Gon and win a diamond. Killua has misgivings about the method, due to the low profit. He notices that Gon struggles for real againsta young woman.[68] Killua & Gon with the bounty list By the following day, the number of challengers has already decreased as rumors began to spread. Leorio, however, is not worried, as that was his plan all along. As he predicted, they are contacted by people from the underground, who give them an invitation to a conditional auction, where theMafiaoffers200 million for each of the seven people on a list they capture. Killua surmises that the seven targets are Spiders and that they stole from the Mafia, which is the reason why the selection and payment methods of the conditional auction were changed. This prompts them to call Kurapika, who does not pick up the phone. Against Leorio's hope that Kurapika has already captured a few members of the Troupe, Killua reveals that his father killed one three years before, and warned his children to stay away from the Spiders. Nonetheless, they agree to go for it.[19]They split up and begin searching, but, as Killua expected, they are unable to find anything. Killua suspects that even if Kurapika had any information on the Spiders, he would not share it. They check their home codes,[69]but they have received no useful tips. They agree to offer a reward of15 million, with Gon pawning his Hunter license for100 million. His gamble leaves Killua and Leorio speechless.[70] Killua & Gon getting the items appraised On September 3rdthey purchase theSouthernpiece Catalog, where they learn more about the days when Greed Island will be auctioned. After that, they post the ad with the reward. As they walk next to a stand participating in a silent auction, Gon picks up a knife, which Killua recognizes as aBen's knife. He has Leorio get it for them and asks Gon how he knew it was a valuable object. Gon replies he sensed aura around it, which causes Killua to determine they can use Gyo to spot objects made by master craftsmen. The two participate in the silent auction,[71]They find four objects shrouded in aura, and on all of them someone namedZepilehas already made a bid. Killua proposes making a bid at the last minute, which allows them to win three items. They take them to theSouthernpiece Auction House, but they are told their catalog has long since been completed, and suggest they try auctioning the items off at a dealers' market. Killua has an antique dealer appraise their items, which he passes off as property he found in his parents' storehouse. The specialist they turn to is sincere in his appraisal of the lithograph and the handmade doll but lies about the worth of thewooden statue. Zepile prevents Gon and Killua from being swindled, claiming the statue is likely a vault for treasure.[72] In return for his help, they treat him to lunch. They start to exchange information by asking one question each, with Gon and Killua explaining they only picked objects that had aura around them, and that Gon wants to get a copy of Greed Island because it might contain clues as to where he can find his father. Zepile reveals he made the vase they two boys were bidding on when he was working as a counterfeiter and, impressed with them and smitten with Gon complimenting his craftsmanship skills, offers them his services. He opens the wooden vault and the three take the treasure to an auction preview,[73]where, in order to lower the price, some interested parties list ways in which the contents of the vault may have been forged. Despite Zepile's intervention, customers hesitate. Curious, Gon asks him what doctoring methods exist, and he explains cauterization, autopsy, and ostomy. They are contacted by Leorio, who has received a real tip on the Spiders.[74]Gon and Killua run off, leaving Zepile in charge of the auction.[75] Phinks confronts Killua They meet up with Leorio and the three head to the bar whereNobunagaandMachiwere spotted. Killua determines they are too powerful for them to take on and realizes they want to luresomeoneout. The increase in tension between the Spiders causes Gon, Killua, and Leorio to tense up. When the two prepare to leave, Gon insists on carrying on with the plan.[75]Killua agrees to track them with Zetsu on the condition they fall back at the first sign of danger. He asks Gon if he has any shadowing experience, and he replies he followed Hisoka during the Hunter Exam, which earns him a punch from Killua. Although the two Spiders can sense them, they cannot determine their position. When the two stop in the middle of a courtyard, Gon and Killua hide in the adjoining abandoned building. When Nobunaga glances in Killua's direction, the two attempt to escape, but find two other Spiders blocking their way. Killua runs intoPhinksand tries to confuse him with his speed, but the Spider grabs him by the ankle and dodges the rocks he throws at him, as well as blocking his kick. By tearing the skin off his ankles, Killua manages to free himself. However, Nobunaga cuts his retreat, having entered the room through the window.[13]They begin to interrogate Killua, who answers their questions sincerely. After asking him if he knows a Nen user who wears chains, Nobunaga demands to know if he prefers to die immediately or later. Killua accepts to be taken to their hideout.[76] Killua realizes the Chain User may be Kurapika Killua spots Hisoka as soon as they enter, and they pretend not to know each other. Gon, however, reacts to his presence, but Killua manages to pass off his surprised reaction as being aimed at Shizuku, who arm-wrestled him for the diamond. Impressed that Gon defeated her, Nobunaga challenges him at the same game. He beats him several times without effort, while talking aboutUvoginand the ""Chain Dude"". Killua repeats they have never heard of him, so Nobunaga threatens to kill him if he speaks out of place again. As he continues talking about him, Killua realizes the ""Chain Dude"" is Kurapika. When Gon, in a fit of rage, defeats Nobunaga[76]and is restrained byFeitan, Killua moves to help him, but Hisoka points a card at his throat. From the Spiders' interactions, Killua understands thatPakunodahas the power to read memories through physical contact and that she has checked them while they were in the car. Nobunaga decides to keep them around untilChrollo's return to nominate Gon as Uvogin's replacement. Gon and Killua are locked in a room, with Nobunaga guarding the only entrance. Killua agonizes over whether he would have been able to intervene had the Spiders wanted to kill Gon, sensing he would have left him to die. As Illumi's voice echoes ominously in his mind, he rejects that conclusion and stands up, ready to fight.[77]However, he quickly desists and punches the wall in frustration. After a while, while Gon tries to remember the three doctoring methods explained to them by Zepile, Killua prepares to lay down his life to let Gon escape, despite being aware their chances are extremely slim. Gon stops him by punching him, which causes them to bicker until Gon remembers the third doctoring trick, ostomy. They prepare for combat, but, instead of engaging Nobunaga, they each kick a hole in a lateral wall.[78] Killua snaps while on the phone with Kurapika Being closest to the stairs, Killua immediately runs down but returns to pick up Gon when he asks for his help to confront Nobunaga. They escape while in a state of Zetsu, with Killua chastising Gon for his naiveté, as they would have never managed to defeat the swordsman. To get stronger so they can continue chasing the Troupe, Killua proposes asking Kurapika for help, as he believes he is the ""Chain Guy"".[79]They finally get through to Kurapika. Killua asks him for help in improving his Nen, but Kurapika refuses to help them against the Troupe even when Killua offers information in exchange. Killua eventually snaps, swearing he will do anything to get Kurapika to cooperate, before handing the phone back to Gon. Kurapika promises to call them back.[80]They return to the hotel, where they find Zepile and Leorio drinking themselves silly. After they recount what they have gone through, Killua states that for Kurapika to have managed to kill a Spider, there must be some secret to Nen. Shortly afterward, Kurapika calls Gon to let him know several Phantom Troupe members are dead.[81] Killua, Gon, Kurapika and Leorio reunite Killua and Gon reunite with Kurapika the following day, while the two boys have an ice cream eating contest inDayroad Park.[82]After Leorio joins the group, Kurapika tells them aboutLimitations and Vows, adding that he will die if he uses his abilities on anyone outside of the Troupe. Troubled by the importance of the information, Killua protests against Kurapika's decision to share it with them and warns him that one of the surviving members has the ability to read memories. Unable to predict what Hisoka will do after the death ofhis target, Killua incites Kurapika to go after the Spiders as soon as possible, with the additional objective of earning the reward offered by the Mafia.[83]Kurapika refuses, but moments later he receives a text from Hisoka telling him the Spiders' corpses were fake.[84]Melodyalso tells him theTen Donshave canceled the reward,[85]causing Killua to change his mind about pursuing the Troupe. Gon insists on going through with it, adding he has a plan on how to access Greed Island, of which he does not want to disclose the details yet. Finding the estimated and then corrected chance of success to be satisfactory, Killua agrees to leave the game to him and chase the Spiders, provided Kurapika assists them. He silently wishes Kurapika will turn them down, but he ends up accepting their help. Killua volunteers to monitor their hideout. He protests when Kurapika gives Gon the job of distracting the Troupe so he can abduct Pakunoda.[86] Melody and Killua tail the Troupe Killua and Leorio leave the table after Gon asks Kurapika to point a Nen blade at his heart, but return clandestinely and eavesdrop on his explanation, making themselves manifest when Kurapika seems to be about to go along with Gon's request, and demand he does the same to them. Kurapika retorts he had no intention of stabbing anyone withJudgment Chain, and that he shared his secrets to reward his friends for their loyalty. Feeling more motivated than before, Killua stakes out the Troupe's hideout, but finds out that dozens of identical buildings have sprung out in the surrounding area,[87]he explores the area and updates Kurapika, who tells him to go back to his post and wait for Melody to reach him. Sometime later, she calls him from the top of a building nearby, telling him to hang up the phone and whisper her a command so she can prove her identity to him.[88]Thanks to her hearing, they manage to follow the group of Spiders who leave the hideout from a safe distance, even as they mingle with the crowd. Melody notices Killua's quiet footsteps and asks if he is an assassin, which he confirms. He awkwardly states he is not helping Kurapika because he wants to, prompting her to smile knowingly. Killua verifies if Pakunoda is in the group, which also comprises of Nobunaga and Chrollo. The two follow them on the subway, which allows Kurapika to determine they are headed to theHotel Beitacle.[89] Gon and Killua captured by the Phantom Troupe Kurapika and Gon launch themselves in pursuit, with Killua unable to stop them. When Chrollo, Machi, and Shizuku stop to confront them, Killua arrives just in time to take Kurapika's place, and he and Gon hand themselves over to the Spiders. Machi binds them up with her Nen threads, taking them to the lobby of the Hotel Beitacle.[90]The three Spiders phone their companions to let them know where they are, which Killua deduces will allow Kurapika to know as well, through Melody. He comes up with a plan, but requires the others to synchronize with him, so he continuously whispers to Melody to give them a signal if she can hear them. Leorio suddenly makes a scene in the lobby, communicating to the two captives the planned time through a coded message.[91]Three minutes before the execution, Nobunaga, Pakunoda, andKortopiarrive at the hotel. Pretending not to want to look at them, Killua closes his eyes and tries to stall Pakunoda, who manages to read their memories one instant before the lights go off. Killua instantly frees himself and breaks her arm. He tries to set Gon free by killing Machi, but she blocks his claws with her chest muscles and restrains him.[92]When the lights return, the Spiders find out that Chrollo is missing. Kurapika leaves them a message warning Pakunoda not to share what she discovered.[93]When he phones the Spiders again, Kurapika uses Killua to verify if all the members are present.[94] Killua and Gon with Pakunoda on the way to the hostage exchange Gon and Killua are then taken to the Phantom Troupe's hideout and chained.[95]After a heated debate Pakunoda is allowed to take Gon and Killua toLingon Airport.[96]On the way there, Pakunoda asks them why they don't run away from her, since she is injured, but Gon replies that they do not want Kurapika to become a murderer.[97]When they are about to board a blimp, Hisoka appears and threatens to kill Gon and Killua if he does not get to fight Chrollo. Kurapika allows him to get on board as well, and the hostage exchange is carried out smoothly.[96]Kurapika apologizes to Gon and Killua for putting them in danger, but states his quest against the Phantom Troupe is not over.[98]"
Who is Gon and Killua with?,Kite,Chimera ant arc,"Gon and Killua with Kite Kite explains to Gon he has been on Greed Island on Ging's request, and that Gon's use of ""Accompany"" instead of ""Magnetic Force"" caused him to meet Kite and not Ging, who wanted to make sure Gon and him would be alone if they were to meet. They have dinner together around a campfire.[156]The next day Kite introduces Gon and Killua to hishis groupof fellow researchers.MontaandBananarecognize Killua's surname, although he explains he quit his profession as an assassin. Alongside Kite's team, Gon and Killua work as biological researchers for one month, finding a great number of new species thanks to their affinity with nature.[157]When they turn in the results toWong, they are told about a giant insect limb. They fly to the Southernpiece Auction House to investigate. The field research is unsuccessful, butPodungodiscovers the limb came from a man-sizedChimera Ant Queen—an insect that devours other animals, and then gives birth to progeny that inherit the characteristics of the different species it has eaten. Killua states that a Chimera Ant Queen of that size could prey on humans.[158] Killua, Kite, and Gon enter NGL After researching the currents, Kite bets that the Chimera Ant Queen might have washed onto an anarcho-primitivist, autonomous nation calledNeo-Green Life. Following his hunch, they head to NGL.[159]Only Gon, Killua, Kite,Stick, and Podungo are able to crossNGL's border stopdue to the country's strict rules. They rent horses and plan to search along the coastline, although Killua is suspicious of the information their translator guides feed them.[160]After receiving an SOS message fromPonzucontaining the location of the nest, Kite, Gon, and Killua rush to help.[161]They cross a deserted village. Gon finds animal carcasses impaled byRammot, who beats him and Killua back. Kite tests them by making them fight theChimera Ant. Gon and Killua tag-team to beat him and, after Killua paralyzes him, Gon lands a near-fatal blow, but Rammot is saved by hisSquadron Leader,Colt. Kite warns the two boys they will see much carnage, but they're willing to continue nonetheless.[162] Killua breaks Mosquito's neck The trio discovers the hidden side of NGL:a narcotics factoryonce commandeered by the former kingpin of the country,Gyro. Once inside Kite senses five presences approaching, causing Killua to realize he is usingEn.Yunju,CentipedeandMosquitoattack them.[163]Killua faces off against the latter, severing her arm when she comes within range. She retorts by ejecting a stinger from her mouth, which Killua dodges, only to fall prey to her real poisonous stinger, located at the tip of her tail. He pretends to be affected by the toxin and, as soon as she looks away, breaks her neck and slashes off her head.[164]The trio discuss their Nen abilities and advance further in Chimera Ant territory. They find themselves surrounded by the Officers ofHagya's squad.[165]Killua loses to Gon at rock-paper-scissors, so he goes second. He is initially concerned byBaro's attacks but smiles when Gon reveals his true power. He then steps in himself, fightingRhino[166]and killing him easily. Kite then activates hisCrazy Slots, summoning a scythe. Gon and Killua sense its power and jump up as he decimates the Officers withSilent Waltz. When he complains about the unreliability of his Nen ability, Killua wonders again why he made it so.[167]That night, the trio spotsHirin,Flutter, andHagya, who however withdraw without a fight.[168] Killua carries Gon out of NGL When they are within sight of the nest, they are located byNeferpitou, who is upon them in an instant and cuts off Kite's arm. The two boys are momentarily overwhelmed by their ominous aura, but when Gon prepares to fight theRoyal Guard, Killua knocks him unconscious and runs away with him, regretting their arrogance and weakness.[169]He stops only when he returns to the checkpoint between NGL and theRepublic of Rokario, where he updatesSpinnerand encounters the officialExtermination Teamformed by Chairman Netero,Morel, andKnov. The Sea Hunter berates him, while Knov dismisses his assessment that Neferpitou was stronger than even the three of them. Killua understands he is not even in their playing field and is surprised when Netero hands him two halves of two tokens, stating that if he and Gon want to join them and continue living as Hunters, they must hold onto them for one month. Killua takes Gon to a hotel and waits for him to wake up, guilt eating away at him for deserting Kite. When Gon comes to, however, he thanks him, believing he would have been a hindrance to Kite had he fought, and claiming that the Hunter is still alive and needs them to rescue him. Killua is awed by Gon's capacity for hope. They resolve to get stronger and write on the city's bulletin board that they accept the challenge.[170] Killua and Gon train to maintain Ren They encounter Knov's eerie student,Palm Siberia, who tells them they have one month to defeat Morel's two disciplesKnuckle BineandShoot McMahonin battle. Each pair has two halves of a token and to pass the challenge, the pair must acquire the opponents' two halves.[171]Killua scouts Knuckle as he proclaims he is ready to fight with a megaphone, determining he is strong. He plans to improve their basics and find out their opponents' abilities. Gon disagrees with the latter proposition, since they will have no such knowledge in NGL. They go back to their hotel, where they find Biscuit waiting for them. She trains them to maintain a state ofRenfor three hours, which will increase their stamina within battle. Less than one hour later, Gon collapses a few seconds before Killua, and they instantly fall asleep. Biscuit uses her ability to reduce their fatigue.[172] Killua and Gon intimidated by Knuckle After about ten days,[173]Gon and Killua succeed in the task. Despite their exhaustion, Biscuit sends them to confront Knuckle without their tokens, so they will be able to fight him again if they lose.[174]The Beast Hunter's superiority is clear to all three of them even before they clash. He orders them to punch him as much as they want and, if they fail to make him budge from his spot, they will have to leave their tokens behind. When he thanks Gon moments before fainting from hisRock, Killua judges him to be an idiot. They take him to their hotel room and, when he comes to, enquire about his motives for joining the Extermination Team. His statement that he wants to know who they are up against before killing them causes Killua to think he would die before finding out. The next morning, the three share breakfast and Knuckle allows Gon and Killua to challenge him as many times as they want in the remaining 20 days.[173] Killua and Gon unable to defeat Knuckle The boys spend the rest of the month training themselves by maintaining Ren for three hours and subsequently heading off to challenge Knuckle,[175]but they cannot draw out so much as half of his might. Ten days before the deadline, Gon wonders why Knuckle is not allowed to go to NGL despite his power, with Killua speculating it is because of his personality. Palm realizes they are not progressing fast enough and recommends they run away so her anger will not be as terrible, but Gon promises they will win and manages to calm her down.[176]Two nights before the deadline, Biscuit allows Gon and Killua to challenge Knuckle after resting. Gon takes Knuckle on by himself while Killua watches from the sidelines.[177][178]He is impressed with the speed with which Gon improves in combat, turningJajanken's long wind-up to his advantage and minimizing the damage suffered by expanding his aura's area of defense. However, he notes that his friend is approaching the limit of his stamina. He is shocked to see Gon charge aJajankenattack from a distance.[179]Gon firesPaperat Knuckle and, throughRound 2, he swiftly preparesRockwhile moving behind him for a pincer attack. However, he exhausts his aura before being able to land a decisive blow. Instead of fighting Knuckle himself, Killua takes Gon back to the hotel, warning Knuckle that he will never forgive him if the following day he will lose for not using his full power.[180] Killua prepares to use electricity As soon as he returns, Biscuit immediately tells him to spar with her.[180]She exposes his habit of fighting to run away if he reckons his opponent is stronger than him, always assuming the worst-case scenario. She orders him to leave Gon's side if he cannot defeat Shoot. At midnight, the two boys meet up with their opponents. Gon takes on Knuckle while Killua and Shoot relocate elsewhere.[7]Killua musters up his courage by thinking that Shoot does not know his ability either. His opponent reveals a birdcage and three floating hands,[181]He checks for traps with Gyo and concludes that Shoot is aManipulator. He repels the hands with his yo-yos when Shoot suddenly appears next to him. Instead of dodging, he tries to electrocute him, but Illumi's conditioning causes his body to freeze, allowing Shoot to land a blow on him. He begins to doubt himself and, after a few instants, his left eye disappears due to the effect ofHotel Rafflesia. He manages to avoid Shoot's next two attacks while chiding himself for only running away. Screaming, he discards his yo-yos and charges at Shoot, batting away his floating hands. Shoot sees electricity crackling around one of them and jumps back, remarking that he does not care for it. Unable to understand how his opponents know about his ability,[182]Killua finds himself unable to keep fighting and gives up.[183] Killua vows to protect Gon In the morning, Killua and a defeated Gon accompany Knuckle and Shoot to the border with NGL. After they are gone, Gon breaks down in tears, lamenting his weakness. Killua tears up by his side, vowing to watch over him for the 30 days in which he will be unable to use Nen due to Knuckle'sHakoware, after which he wants to part ways with him.[183]On the way back toDoli City, Spinner tells them about theSmall-billed Swansfrom her hometown.[184]As they prepare to enter the hotel, Killua realizes that the first person he will have to protect Gon from is Palm. He is outraged by Palm's demand that Gon do whatever she says to make up for breaking his promise of taking her to NGL, and even more by her request to be his girlfriend. After Gon manages to pacify her, the two head to the gym to train, and Killua compliments his ability to deal with her. Gon reveals he has experience with women, shocking his friend. Just as Killua catches himself losing his determination to leave Gon's side, Knuckle calls Gon to tell him they found Kite and will be back in three days. Relieved, Killua thinks that all that is left is for him to guard Gon for one month.[185] Killua relieved after removing Illumi's needle He accompanies Gon to the woods next to the city as he makes preparations for his date with Palm. Back at the hotel, he learns from the news ofa Chimera Antattack inPata City, deeming the threat to be sufficiently far from them. He lies to Gon, claiming the following day he will work out at the gym all day, whereas in reality he disguises himself and follows him and Palm around. When they head into the woods, Killua senses the aura of a Chimera Ant. Fearing that Gon will attack it in a rage or that Palm will start screaming at him, he decides to confront it himself.[186]He leads the Ant, who turns out to be Rammot, upwind and away from the two. When he prepares for combat, however, he finds himself paralyzed by Illumi's conditioning. Unable to react properly but unwilling to flee, Killua suffers a beatdown at Rammot's hands, while trying to resist his brother's influence. When his resolve reaches its apex, right before Rammot is about to land a lethal blow, Killua senses a needle in his skull and pulls it out, dodging the attack with surprising speed. He realizes that the needle was the source of Illumi's influence on him. He orders Rammot to tell the other Chimera Ants that they will be killed if they get near him or Gon. When Rammot begins to utter a protest, Killua tears off his head and crushes it.[8] Killua and Knuckle watch as Gon faces Kite He rushes back to where he last saw Gon and Palm, and, when he cannot find them, runs to the hotel. There he finds Palm make Gon write apologies over and over. Killua and Palm begin to fight. She tries to stab him in the head with a kitchen knife, but he easily dodges it. He takes Gon and runs away, followed by a murderous Palm. He is astonished that even after that exchange, Gon believes he can reason with her.[187]Gon and Killua hang together for the next two days, during which, unbeknownst to them, they are monitored by Shoot.[188]The Extermination Team members then come together and Shoot frees Kite from his birdcage, returning him to his normal size. Killua watches silently as Gon allows himself to be beaten by the manipulated Hunter. When the second level of Neferpitou's control is activated, Gon swears to Killua he will take the Royal Guard on himself. Knuckle asks Killua what caused the two of them to change that much in such a short span of time, to which Killua replies it is the Chimera Ants that changed them.[189] Killua stops Gon's attack on Morel Under the guise ofthe former Kingof theRepublic of East Gorteau,Merueminitiates the process offorcibly awakening Nen in the civiliansof East Gorteau — resulting in the deaths of millions — in order to form his own personal army toconquer the world. ThroughColt, the Extermination Team learns that the ""Selection"" will take place in ten days. Killua is concerned about Netero's silence, and just then he texts them the plan. When, after midnight, Gon reacquires the ability to use Nen, Morel demands that he strike him withRock. Gon's fury manifests in the form of tremendous aura output, and Killua calmly stops him before he can carry through with the attack. As per their request, they two of them are assigned to taking care of Neferpitou.[190]Due to East Gorteau'sspy system, Gon and Killua are forced to infiltrate the country while keeping out of the sight of civilians. Upon crossing the border, they find out a massacre has taken place in an abandoned village near the border, which prompts Killua to deduce the ""Selection"" has already begun. Gon decides to attempt to stop it, even if it means being discovered. Killua tells him he will do it by himself and that Gon should save his strength for Neferpitou. He orders him to remain hidden no matter how many people he sees being murdered.[191]He apologizes for lashing out, confessing that he is on edge. He feelsMeleoron's gaze upon himself, but he and Gon split up anyway.[192] Killua encountersLeol's Squad Killua proceeds to take out Neferpitou's puppets and warn the people of East Gorteau that Mig Jol-ik has fallen.[193]To make his moves unpredictable, he continues inciting riots while moving to the south-east, untilan ominous feelingmakes him change direction. Because of his actions, the Ants put the country under martial law, but Killua is undeterred.[194]Ming's reappearance on television forces Killua to abandon his plan to incite riots and limit himself to taking out Neferpitou's puppets. After dispatching a platoon in Luonton, he heads north, where he runs into an ambush prepared by Leol. He dives into the nearby jungle to lure in Flutter, who is flying too high for him to reach,[195]but is attacked by the unit captained bya bombardier/dung beetle Chimera Ant. He manages to kill most of his underlings, but the Captain blasts him off with explosive chemicals, which causes Killua to realize Flutter is still observing him. Suddenly, he is shot with several fleas[196]secreting an anticoagulant. With Ken, he manages to figure out the location of the sniper, whom he tails to the entrance to a cave. As soon as the man jumps in, Killua leaps after him and jams his finger into his head. Tentacles emerge from the man's body to restrain him,[197]but he cuts them off and uses the suckers to adhere to the stalactites, preventing himself from falling into the Ant-infested lake underneath.[198] Killua takes out the Ortho siblings Ikalgo, the Chimera Ant Captain who was controlling the man's body, attempts to escape, but Killua easily catches him and interrogates him about Flutter's ability, offering to spare him. Ikalgo attempts to commit suicide by letting himself fall in the lake underneath, but Killua, moved by his loyalty to his comrades, saves him with a yo-yo and flings him to safety. At that moment, a shark-like Chimera Ant jumps out of the water in an attempt to crush him, only to be swiftly torn to pieces by the boy. Without him noticing,Remoramanages to affix a pin to his clothes that wasconjuredby theOrtho Siblings.[198]Once ashore, Killua is stabbed by multiple fish darts that seem to come out of nowhere. As the Ortho Siblings taunt him telepathically, Killua realizes their ability is connected to darts, which do not exist until the moment they pierce his skin, making them unavoidable.[199]Killua gets severely injured from the darts as they pierce him through every part of his body, and suffers from extreme blood loss as he counts down the points. When the final throw, which should pierce his forehead, comes, Killua converts his aura into electricity to enhance his reactions and manages to block it. He then breaks off the tip and sticks it to his forehead with a suction cup. He fakes death by lying still on the ground and waits for the siblings to come out, beheading them when they emerge from underwater.[17] Killua's body healed As he tries to leave the cave, however, he collapses from the blood loss. On the verge of losing consciousness, he apologizes to Gon, but Ikalgo saves him by taking him toan underground clinic.[200]He wakes up in the underground clinic two days later, wherethe nurseannoys him to pay his expensive hospital bill. He phones home to pay the hospital bill and be discharged. He invites Ikalgo to join the Extermination Team, who is touched by Killua's actions as he considers an octopus-like him as a friend, and decides to go with him.[201]Killua and Ikalgo meet up with Gon, Knuckle, Shoot, andMeleoronand revise their strategies for the infiltration. Killua dismisses Gon's concern about Palm. Despite the plan being laid out on paper, he continues to feel anxious.[202]19 hours before the attack, he does a run-through with Gon and Ikalgo, during which he suggests working on measures to deal with any unforeseen contingencies, no matter how unlikely. To figure out why Neferpitou deactivated their En, they phone Colt, who tells them the Royal Guard must have been healing someone. Their conclusion is thatthe Kinghurt himself, which they relay to Morel.[203] Members plan for the invasion At 6 p.m., the three slip into one of the batteries marching fromPeijinto theroyal palace, and from there into Knov's dimension. As the Extermination Team members prepare themselves for the attack, Killua glances at Gon, vowing to make sure that no one will interfere with his battle thanks to his new ability,Godspeed. Five and a half hours later, the Extermination Team leaves the room to move to one closer to the palace.[204]They all convene to charge in from the exit connected to the central stairway.[205]Seven minutes before midnight, Killua begins to argue with Ikalgo again about unexpected scenarios, one of which leads the group to consider the possibility that Palm has become the King's concubine. Although he tells Gon to focus only on his battle, he cannot assuage his unease and brings up the topic of the King's self-inflicted injury again. Morel's conclusion leaves him unconvinced, but, with the raid starting in a minute, he is forced to brush his misgivings aside.[206]Six seconds before go-time, he senses Gon's cold single-mindedness. At midnight sharp, Killua is the fifth to storm the palace,[207]appearing next to the stairway andMenthuthuyoupi.[208] The invasion begins As Killua anticipated, the Royal Guards have different positions than expected. The Extermination Team freezes momentarily when Zeno'sDragon Divepierces the palace, with the exception of Gon, who charges at Menthuthuyoupi. Killua quickly deduces his friend is acting on a scenario in which Meleoron and Knuckle were killed by Zeno's ability while undetectable; to the team's relief, they see the Royal Guard being pushed aside by an invisible force, signaling that their comrades survived.[209]Gon and Killua attempt to rush past him on the stairs, but, in the instant of hesitation caused by the reappearance of Neferpitou's En, Menthuthuyoupi destroys them.[210]Surviving the strike unscathed, the two change direction and decide to leap from the second to the third floor from outside. They run past Ikalgo and Killua glimpsestwo soldierAnts. Subconsciously realizing they might pose a threat to the approaching Ikalgo, he dispatches them before even understanding what he is doing.[211]Ikalgo's declaration that he is in his debt manages to calm his swirling emotions[212]and the boy reaches Gon just as Zeno is about to relocate Netero andMeruem. Gon tells him where Neferpitou is, and his words leave Killua wondering whether he was speaking only for himself or for both of them; fearing the answer, he does not ask.[213] They jump to the roof of the third floor, where they encounter Zeno, who cryptically tells them to judge for themselves what is going on inside. Killua follows Gon into the room where Neferpitou crouches overKomugi,Doctor Blythehovering above them.[214]As Gon rages, Killua notes that Neferpitou is not preparing for battle, which leads him to conclude that he is protecting and healing the girl, the contingency neither the Extermination Team nor Zeno was prepared for, and the reason the King injured himself. He is reticent to tell Gon, but Neferpitou themselves states they are healing her. They offer to do anything if they let them finish, but before Killua can formulate his request, Gon cuts him off.[215]Killua stops his friend when he is about to attack the Royal Guard. His cold remark hurts him, but he manages to talk him into restraining himself. Gon decides to wait for one hour, after which he will take Neferpitou to restore Kite.[216]He is pulled into Meleoron'sGod's Accomplice[217]and the two move elsewhere so the former Squadron Leader can update him. Killua agrees to assist Knuckle against Menthuthuyoupi.[218] Killua attacks Youpi withWhirlwind Exploiting Meleoron's invisibility, he manages to paralyze Youpi withThunderboltright when he is about to kill Knuckle, allowing the Beast Hunter to survive and strike his opponent several times before running away.[219]He then appears in front of Menthuthuyoupi and vents his frustration by beating him up withWhirlwind. When he runs out of electric aura, he backs away to recharge. Menthuthuyoupi pursues him, but Killua escapes thanks to Meleoron's ability.[220]Killua finds a plug and starts recharging his electric supply. He states he will go back to where Gon is once he is done, and instructs Meleoron to discuss what to do next with Knuckle.[221] Killua cries before Palm Once he is finished, he starts heading back but senses someone watching him. He discovers it's Palm, who has been mutated into a Chimera Ant. Reflecting that seeing her like that could lead Gon to a mental breakdown, he steps out of hiding to intercept her. Pondering that perhaps she came to him thanks to her clairvoyance, and thus remembers him, he starts to believe she might still be the same. The two exchange a few words, but when Palm asks him where Gon is, he becomes wary of her, ultimately calling her an enemy and preparing to fight her. She activatesBlack Widowand immediately smashes one of his yo-yos. Killua is forced on the defensive by her sheer power.[222]As he defends himself, he asks Palm why she wants to meet Gon, stating that depending on her answer, he might tell her, as Gon's mind risks to shatter. Although at first, he had no intention of letting the two meet, he ends up bursting in tears, lamenting his inability to help his friend. Palm manages to recover her senses and destroys Pouf's clone, who was ordering her to kill Killua. She relieves his emotional pain, telling him it is thanks to his words she freed herself from the Ant's control and that he is the only one who can really help Gon.[223] Shaiapouf attacks Killua and Komugi Palm and Killua reunite with Ikalgo, announcing their intention to stay by Gon's side without interfering with him. Ikalgo accepts and the three go find Meleoron and Knuckle. Killua and Knuckle go to the room where Gon and Komugi are, and the boy entrusts them with Komugi until he and the Royal Guard return. After they leave, Knuckle enquires whether Killua would not like to go with him, to which the boy responds that Neferpitou might take him hostage.[224]Thanks to Palm's clairvoyance, the Extermination Team discovers that the King has survived his fight with Netero.[225]Killua takes Komugi while Palm opens the underground hanger, in an attempt to figure out ifShaiapouf's target is Komugi or Meleoron. The Royal Guard's clone goes after Killua,[226]who however doges him withGodspeed. Shaiapouf splits up his clone in smaller segments, who promise Killua the King will forgive him if he surrenders. Killua does not believe him and continues running farther away from the palace until Komugi begins to struggle to get free. Killua barely manages to save both of them when the segments reunite again and attempt to kill the girl. He knocks her out and draws a circle around himself with his aura. When the clone attempts to cross it, Killua burns its cells with electricity. Shortly afterward, the segments fly back towards the palace.[227] Killua tries to save Gon from Neferpitou's attack Minutes later, Palm finds Killua and tells him that Gon and Pitou have reached Peijin. At his request, she explains her ability to him. He thanks her without telling her why, to her confusion. Suddenly, Palm is shocked[228]to see that Neferpitou is healing themselves while Gon is unresponsive. A segment of Shaiapouf informs them that Neferpitou believes that Komugi has been rescued, and offers to stop the Royal Guard from killing Gon if they give him Komugi. Without hesitation, Killua torches the segment and entrusts Komugi to Palm. ActivatingSpeed of Lightning, he rushes to Gon's side.[229]As he approaches the hideout, he feels an incredible aura. It takes him a few moments to recognize Gon in his adult form. As his friend stands next to a decapitated Neferpitou, Killua is horrified fathoming the price Gon will have to pay for that power-up. WhenTerpsichoramanipulates the Royal Guard's corpse, Killua intervenes just in time to prevent Gon from being killed, although his friend still loses his right arm. Gon tells Killua that he is not in pain, but happy for looking like Kite did before his death, saddening his friend. Despite his protests, Gon musters even more aura to deliver the final blow to the Chimera Ant.[230]Palm later sees Killua carrying an unconscious Gon.[231] Gon is taken to the hospital inSwardani Citywhere Morel and Shoot are also recovering. While his friend is in a deep coma and his condition deteriorates each passing minute, Killua sits outside of the room, looking at him through a window. He thinks back to how Gon cut him out during the raid and swears to make him apologize. Knov arrives and tells him he is preparing a team of doctors, to which Killua responds he will save Gon himself and leaves the hospital, making a phone call.[232]"
What is the relationship between Killua and Nen?,friend,Abilities & powers,"Killua has all the benefits granted by his status as a Hunter. Furthermore, as a member of the Zoldyck Family, he has vast wealth at his disposal, although he needshis father's orhis grandfather's permission to use them. His family name alone is enough to scare the ones that know what it is associated to. Killua has been trained since birth to become a human weapon and is recognized by his family to be the most talented assassin in the entire history of theZoldycks.[12]When he took theHunter Examthe first time, he was the fourth most powerful applicant ,[15]and the one thatSatotzbelieved would pass. Up until the Hunter Exam, he did not hesitate a second to kill, but after meetingGon, this tendency subsided; still, he is not afraid to resort to extreme means when circumstances demand it. Like his friend Gon, Killua has an astounding natural talent that enables him to learn at a fast rate and allegedly ad infinitum, a characteristic that piqued Hisoka's interest.[20]His potential extends to Nen as well, as noted byWingandBisky. Although he primarily fights with his bare hands, Killua is able to use any kind of weapons, but the only one he employs consistently are his custom-made yo-yos. When he tried to prevent the Selection, he was so confident in his strength that he claimed that tanks and fighter jets would be useless against him,[194]and in fact, he was able to effortlessly subdue a military unit comprised of at least four tanks.[195] Killua's assassin intentions His training endowed him with near immunity to poison, high tolerance to electricity, great agility and physical strength, advanced armed and unarmed combat and stealth techniques, which he acquired at a very young age. He can also drive cars[239]and airships.[238]His intellect and exceptional analytical skills are equally remarkable, and it is often through a strategy that he can defeat opponents who are stronger or more experienced than him. He is also able to walk without making a sound and sleep with a larger part of his brain awake than normal, so he can avoid attacks even in his sleep, even if they come from an armed, albeit weaker,fellow Hunter.[187]After leaving Greed Island, due to his prowess in Nen, Killua became able to blend with nature more easily, which allowed him to find multiple new species of animals at a rate that astoundedKite's companions.[157] Killua's main weakness used to be an inferiority complex that paralyzed him with fear and prevented him from fighting opponents that could pose a threat to him, even if their overall strength was lower than his own. Although it was originally believed to be a product of his training, it is later revealed that it was actually due to a Nen-imbued needle that Illumi had implanted in his brain. Its removal caused Killua to snap free of his brother's conditioning, thus regaining the full control of his mental capabilities in battle. This also had the effect of making his overall movements better, increasing his speed. Preternatural Perception:Killua has proven multiple times to be extremely perceptive, whether by gauging a person's approximate power or by detecting their aura or gaze. He first demonstrated this by sensing Hisoka's bloodlust when it was still subtle.[23]He could tell at a glance that Majtani was not as strong as he pretended to be,[31]and offered Gon an estimation of how he stacked up against Hisoka, Hanzo and himself in terms of combat ability.[15]He could also tell at a glance that Machi and Nobunaga were way out of his and Gon's league, unlike Leorio and Gon himself.[75]His corollary that the stronger the opponent, the better they are at hiding their power turned out to be true, occasionally causing Killua to severely underestimate his adversary.[27][46][16][111]However, as he honed his Nen abilities, his guesses became more accurate, and he notably sensed Netero's power,[170]whereas he had downplayed it in the past.[27]He is extremely aware of his surroundings, as he managed to detectMeleoron's presence in spite of the latter specializing in erasing it.[192]He is also able to sense the gaze of others even if their aura is hidden.[222] Killua breaks Pakunoda's arm Enhanced Strength:Killua has displayed his strength on several occasions. Before he learned Nen, he was able to open a 16-ton gate[44]and after he learned Nen, he opened the 64-ton gate.[233]He can easily lift boulders several times his own weight[116]and bisect massive trees with a single strike.[196]He has also managed to break bones of stronger Nen users, such as Pakunoda and Machi.[92]He was able to rip off Rammot's head with one swift motion and crush it in his hand,[8]as well as to pierce the exoskeletons of two Chimera Ants with his bare hands and minimum aura expenditure.[211] Killua attacking Ikalgo before the Ant could react Immense Speed and Reflexes:Killua is extremely quick on his feet. He was able to pluck out Johness' heart without the serial killer noticing until he saw his own heart.[34]However, his speed was no match forPhinks, who could follow and anticipate his every movement.[13]At the beginning of his training with Biscuit, he could run 70 km in about 3 hours without breaking a sweat, unlike Gon.[249]He was subsequently able to outrun Biscuit in her younger form once, although that might have been partly due to a difference in motivation.[122]When he retried the Hunter Exam, he knocked out a maximum of 1488 applicants in less than 45 minutes, his speed being such that the few who managed to catch a glimpse of him only saw a shadow.[124]Upon removing the needle, possibly due to becoming capable of devolving his full abilities to offense, Killua's speed increased to the point he was able to cover the distance between himself and Rammot and sever the upset Chimera Ant's head without him being able to react,[8]whereas previously Rammot managed to hold his own against both Killua and Gon at the same time.[162]He was able to cut a massive tree in two and twist off the arms and head of another soldier Ant in the blink of an eye,[196]as well as to dispatch two more by inflicting two lethal wounds to each within a ridiculously short time frame.[211]As impressive as Killua's attack and movement speed, if not even more so, are his reactions: he can dodge a bullet moving at extreme velocity even if it is fired within 57 cm of his body.[197] Immense Agility:Killua's mobility allows him to attack from every position, move in the enemy's blind spot, and fight on any kind of terrain.[196]In terms of defense, Killua takes full advantage of his agility to jump out of reach[16]or dodge the enemy's attacks[196]without losing his foothold. He has an excellent sense of balance, as seen when he was shown standing with nonchalance on the back of a horse,[160]and exceptional coordination.[196]He managed to dispatch a small squadron of Chimera Ants that had drawn him in the treetops and surrounded him in a few seconds, not only avoiding their attacks, but also turning them against his assailants.[196] Enhanced Stamina:Killua was able to complete a long-distance run more than 80 kilometers long, and taking place on uneven terrains such as ascending stairs and a swamp,[22]and was the only non-user among the applicants not to exhibit the slightest sign of fatigue.[24]He fought Binolt for 10 days straight while keeping his guard up even as he slept.[116]Not even thirty hours of continuous travelingNGLby foot and battling the armed forces could wear him down significantly.[195] Advanced Durability:Killua was unscathed after being kicked in the belly byImori.[38]He also stated that a blow to the neck thatHanzoused to knock out Gon would only leave him stunned.[40]Even being electrocuted with 1,000,000 volts of electricity only causes him to feel pain, but no physical damage.[58]Far more remarkably, he held the ball for Gon three times when the latter punched it withRock, and, despite the feat being compared to forming the barrel of a cannon with one's naked hands, he used no aura to protect them,[141][142][143]although he suffered grievous injuries which he was unable to recover from in nearly a month.[150] Enhanced Endurance:Killua can bear very intense physical pain without his physical or mental abilities being impaired. An excellent example is provided by his confrontation with theOrtho Siblings, in which he had his body punctured by several darts and still managed to make calculations and prepare a strategy, even coming up with an idea for a new ability.[17]He fell asleep while his brother Milluki was whipping him, and did not react when the latter burned him with a cigar.[12]He can instantaneously dislodge his joints without seeming to suffer any drawback.[92] Killua's resistance to electricity Immense Poison Resistance:Due to his assassin training, Killua became resistant to a great number of poisons, toxins and chemicals. He first displayed this ability when he drank five cans of Tonpa's juice during the Hunter Exam without experiencing any side effects, despite the beverage containing a laxative that, in that dose, should have completely dehydrated him.[2]When he was stung byMosquito, he revealed that her toxin had absolutely no effect on his body.[164] Muscle and Joint Control:Killua can dislodge his joints at will in less than a second. He demonstrated this ability by dislocating his shoulders, elbows, wrists, and fingers to free himself fromMachi's strings.[92] Killua's claws Healing Factor:Killua can recover from injury faster than normal, as demonstrated when the multiple wounds inflicted to him by the Ortho siblings healed completely in only two days.[201]However, he was unable to recover from the extensive damage to his hands caused by Gon'sRockeven after 26 days.[150] Genius-Level Intellect:Killua's intelligence far exceeds that of any boy his age and is exceptional also for adults. He is knowledgeable about a wide variety of topics and is endowed with prodigious intuition and analytical skills. His deductive abilities have allowed him to make accurate predictions on multiple occasions. He can also bear severe mental strain and still think clearly. To match all of these impressive intellectual capacities, Killua is also an extremely quick thinker who can adapt to completely unforeseen developments.[209]Although he normally relies on logic, sometimes to a fault, he is capable of creative thought, which allowed him to devise the basics ofGodspeedin the heat of combat.[17]He is also tremendously observant, and he believed he could notice the slightest change in the expression of two Spiders.[13]His terrific intellect allows him to pick up on details that would ordinarily go unnoticed on a subconscious level, which results in him feeling a sense of unease towards a certain course of action before realizing why.[145][202] Master Strategist:Killua is capable of devising complex tactics as well as run accurate simulations and evaluate the success rate of each of them, even in the middle of a fight.[125]His skills in evaluating the assets at his disposal and making the most of them are such that Gon and Biscuit were completely dependent on him to organize their Greed Island cards.[123][126]Despite Knuckle being his senior, Killua also presided the strategic meeting before the invasion of the palace.[202] Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant:In spite of his young age, Killua is an exceptional melee fighter and master of innumerable unarmed combat techniques. The difference in experience between assassination and a proper fight initially prevented him from making the most of them,[115]but he soon improved to an astounding degree. He countered Sub's assault despite the latter having a superior output and his own hands being unusable. During their duel, he goaded Sub into striking him in a certain way by pretending to have an imperfect guard.[125]His fighting style, which is extremely versatile, aims at dealing the maximum amount of damage in the shortest time possible, striking critical points and making ample use of lightning-fast submission holds to incapacitate or kill the opponent.[195]He can knock out a person by striking a sensitive spot on their neck while moving at high speed, a feat which requires superhuman levels of precision.[124]Killua is particularly skilled at finding patterns in the fighting style of his adversary and at figuring out their weak spots, and at using them to exploit or create openings.[125]He rarely resorts to combos, preferring to land single, critical strikes[46]or to maintain a safe distance from more powerful opponents.[182]After the removal of Illumi's needle, he became more assertive and prone to deadly blitzes, making the most of an opponent's distraction[8]of vulnerability even if it means chasing them.[197]Due to the Zoldyck philosophy of never putting their lives at risk while fighting, he was also taught a wide array of defensive and escape tactics.[16]He seems to prefer to dodge attacks rather than block them, sometimes using the foe's charge to reposition himself in their blind spot,[46]but he also has a solid guard.[223] Killua using The Snake Awakens Master Weapon Specialist:Killua is capable of wielding a great number of weapons proficiently as well as of turning any object into a lethal one. He won Bopobo’s challenge by drenching him in liquor and setting it ablaze,[132]and killed multiple soldier Chimera Ants with the arms they wielded.[195]Killua is also adept at using projectile-type weapons,[17]although he has never employed any in combat. His weapon of choice are two yo-yos weighing 50 kilograms each, which he can wield with great dexterity, amazing pro-Hunter Shoot McMahon.[182]He can use them as lightning-fast long-ranged weapons,[211]as a grapple,[198]or swing them around himself to counter incoming attacks.[182]He can also use the environment to alter their trajectory, causing them to hit the target from their blind spots. His electric aura can also be channeled through them to shock a target from a distance.[125]Killua is reluctant to use them in battle if he is unable to prevent the information from being leaked to other enemies, preferring to resort to his raw physical abilities and combat skills in order for his opponent to know as little about him as possible.[197] Master of Stealth:Killua is very proficient in hiding, spying, and infiltration.Melody, a Hunter renowned for her hearing, commented that she could hardly hear Killua's footsteps even when he was running alongside her.[89] Masterful Skater:Killua is extremely dexterous with his skateboard, performing acrobatic tricks with ease.[6] Masterful Darts Player:Killua mastered the game when he was six or seven, with a count of 1440 points. This skill came in handy against the Ortho siblings, when he recognized the rules the brother was playing with.[17]"
How many Nen types does Killua have?,at least two,Nen,"Killua is aTransmuterwith dual affinity towardEnhancement.[250]Killua's most efficient in changing the properties and shape of his aura. Just like Gon's, Killua's talent is said to be absolutely astounding, found only in one out of ten million people.[6]Thanks to Biscuit's training he has honed his skills in at least two Nen types other than his own, namelyEnhancementandConjuration.[122]He has also mastered the four basic techniques and at least five of the advanced ones .[197]He performedTensuccessfully on the first try with next to no instructions, a feat which Wing described as both ""amazing"" and ""terrifying"",[48]and learned Ren andGyoin only one night.[56]He was also capable of performingZetsuwith great skill and without guidance[52]after seeing Gon use it againstGido. It also earned him the praise of the Phantom Troupe, although they were able to sense him.[13]He is able to maintain Ren for three hours outside of combat without the slightest difficulty,[176]and Ten at all times.[157]He can formKoin an instant, as shown when he used it to knock Gon out while the latter was going to fight Neferpitou.[169]While Gon can release a bigger amount of aura, Killua is generally hailed as the one with the best control, to the point that by the time he confronted Razor he was already capable ofdistributing his aurawith a margin of error lower than 1%, which caused Biscuit to comment that she reached his degree of mastery only in her late twenties. In spite of his lack of experience, he can measure with accuracy how much aura he should employ and in which area in a split second, relying solely on the instinctive knowledge granted by his fearsome potential.[143]He easily got ahead of Gon during their training on Greed Island,[118]overcoming his inexperience with sheer insight.[143] Killua showcases his electric aura Killua developed a series ofNen abilitiesin which he alters the properties of his aura to make it similar to electricity. This was inspired and made possible by the years of electric shocks he received as a child, both as training against torture and as punishment.[103]Biscuit was very impressed that he could create such a complex Nen ability at his age.[122]He can shock the opponent either through physical contact or while keeping his distance, channeling his aura through his yo-yos[125]or throwing it in the form of a lightning strike.[220]Although most Nen users receive no damage from the electricity itself, they are still hurt and paralyzed for a few instants.[125]The peak of Killua's Nen skills are two Nen abilities collectively referred to asGodspeed, both of which use Killua's electric aura to vastly enhance his speed by allowing him to transcend the limits of his physical potential:Whirlwindmakes his movements automatic, whileSpeed of Lightningallows him to remain in control his body.[220]Regardless of which core function he employs, he can regulate the discharge of electricity outside of his body, making it so an ally touching him will only feel a mild stinging sensation,[237]whereas an enemy being struck by one of his blows will be painfully electrocuted[220]and even suffer burns if unprotected.[227]Both applications can also be used to carry others, both to displace them[237]and to protect them from enemy attacks.[227] In order to generate electric aura, Killua needs to ""charge"" himself by letting electricity run through his body,[115]such as by tasering himself[100]or holding onto a plug.[221]By his own admission, however, his electric aura is not very potent and he runs out of it rather quickly.[165]Another inconvenience is that Killua is not aware of exactly how much electric aura he produces, which can result in him depleting his reserves unexpectedly.[220] In the second film[251]and the 2011 anime[252]respectively, Killua was able to use the electric aura to activate simple machines[251]or burn sturdy objects, such asRhino's exoskeleton, to make them frailer and subsequently break them.[252]"

How many tons was Leorio able to open up to the 2nd door of the Testing Gate?,ten tons,Abilities & powers,"As a member of theZodiacs, Leorio's authority exceeds that of most Hunters.[3]Although this is partly owed toGing's actions,[60]Leorio's charisma conquered a great number of Hunters so that he became a finalist during the election of the 13th Chairman of theHunter Association.[64]His great popularity is also the reason he was selected as a Staff Advisor.[68]Although he was apparently deemed capable enough to participate in the dangerous expedition to theDark Continent,[3]Leorio's actual fighting skills are unknown. During the Hunter Exam, he was able to survive the throw of one ofHisoka's cards, although he was still injured,[12]andNeterodeclared his combat prowess to be superior toBodoro's.[34]He left a strong enough impression on Hisoka to be deemed an opponent worth giving the chance to ""mature"".[6]Despite being moderately observant,[21][23]Leorio's temper often causes him to act rashly. Preternatural Perception:After learning Nen, Leorio acquired some degree of sensorial skills, which he previously lacked.[21][32]They allowed him to perceive Kurapika's increase in power and the tension between Machi and Nobunaga.[52]However, he was unable to detect the aura released byNanika.[64] Enhanced Strength:Leorio was able to open up to the 2nd door of theTesting Gate, weighing 8 tons, whereas Gon and Kurapika could only open the 1st door, making him the physically strongest member of the trio when they went toKukuroo Mountain.[37]In Yorknew City, he broke the arm of a massive man whom he was arm wrestling against along with the table beneath in an instant and without effort.[44]He was also able to throw a knife with enough force to lodge it into a pillar.[56] Advanced Speed and Reflexes:Leorio managed to avoid a sneak attack fromSommy, although he was not faster than Tonpa.[27]The fact he survived the throw of one of Hisoka's cards, although he still incurred in injury,[12]shows he has better reactions than average even among the talented applicants of the 287th Hunter Exam,[10]many of whom died from similar attacks.[13] Advanced Agility:Having passed the amended Second Phase of the Hunter Exam, Leorio proved more nimble than many other applicants.[16] Advanced Stamina:Although he was ultimately knocked out and carried by Hisoka, Leorio was able to run for more than 80 km on different terrains during the First Phase of the Hunter Exam.[7]His determination proved instrumental in completing the test, as he made it to the end through sheer willpower.[11]He also recovers quickly from injury, showing no signs of being fatigued or in pain when he came to after Hisoka's punch.[14] Weapon Specialist:Leorio's weapon of choice is a knife, although he was never seen fighting with it. However, he has shown sufficient skill to throw it at a target in the dark and cause it to pierce a pillar.[73] Medical Knowledge:Leorio has a certain degree of expertise in the medical field, granted him by his studies. The Kiriko's son noted that Leorio's ability to give first aid was the best he had ever seen.[9]He could easily tellMajtaniwas faking unconsciousness by examining his pupil.[23] Skilled Haggler:Leorio has talent for haggling, which once earned him an applause from onlookers.[41]"

Where does Kurapika make his first appearance onboard a ship?,from Whale Islandto a testing site of the287th Hunter Exam,Hunter exam arc,"Kurapika, Gon, and Leorio standing before the Captain Kurapika makes his first appearance onboarda shipthat goes fromWhale Islandto a testing site of the287th Hunter Exam. He, Gon, and Leorio are the only 3 candidates unaffected by a storm the night before. When theCaptainannounces an even fiercer one is approaching, the three are the only candidates not to leave the boat. He initially refuses to answer the Captain's question about his motives, but when he reveals that he is an examiner Kurapika replies that he is the last of the Kurta and wants to capture the Phantom Troupe. When Leorio objects he does not need to become a Hunter to do so, Kurapika condescendingly explains a license facilitates the acquisition of information. When Leorio answers the Captain that he is attracted by the material possessions provided by being a Hunter, Kurapika remarks that money cannot buy class. The two quarrel over their different opinions and decide to end it with a fight out on the deck while another storm is raging. When they are about to start,a crew memberis knocked off the deck by a piece of wood broken off from a yard. Leorio immediately rushes to help him, followed shortly by Kurapika, but they fail to catch him. Gon jumps overboard and grabs him, while the two catch him by his legs. They both reprimand Gon for his recklessness, then apologize to and makeup with each other. Seeing that, the captain laughs and decides to take the trio to the port nearest the exam hall,Zaban City's.[8] Kurapika stops Leorio from attacking Once they dock, the Captain tells Gon to head for a lone tree up a hill, and Gon decides to follow his advice instead of taking the bus to Zaban City. Kurapika decides to follow him, interested in what he may do. Leorio later rejoins them after learning the bus doesn't head to Zaban City. In what seems an abandoned town, Kurapika and Gon hear people around them.An old lady, also an examiner, told them they have to answer a riddle that they have only 5 seconds time limit. While Kurapika and Leorio scuffle over the prospect of one causing the other to fail,another applicanttakes the test in their place. Upon hearing the riddle, a deeply stunned Kurapika thinks of it's subjectivity, making itabsolutelyimpossible to give a correct answer. While Leorio protests the impossibility of the riddle, Kurapika hears the applicant the lay let pass scream and understands how to pass the test, but the screener silences him and, after Kurapika agrees to it, poses them her question. Getting annoyed, Leorio picks up a wooden stick and attacks her but is blocked by Kurapika, who explains to him that they have passed because keeping silent is the correct answer to this question. The old lady then tells them to go to a house in the forest to find a couple, who will be their navigators if they consider the trio qualified. Kurapika and Leorio laugh at Gon when he states he cannot find an answer to the question, but become pensive when he suggests they might one day be faced with a similar choice. The three then take the path opened by the screener.[9] Kurapika strikes the Kiriko disguised as Leorio Four hours later, upon entering the house, they see a wounded man lying on the floor and a woman being held captive by aKiriko. The monster flees as soon as it sees them. Telling Leorio to take care of the husband, Kurapika and Gon chase after it, and Kurapika is impressed by Gon's vision in the darkness, and shocked by his ignorance about Magical Beasts. Gon clubs the creature and forces it to let go of the wife. Kurapika catches her and notices the strange tattoos on her hands and face. Leorio then shows up and says that there is nothing to worry about the husband. Kurapika hits him in the face with his wooden sword. It turns out this Leorio is a Kiriko in disguise, but Kurapika claims he did not know, and that he hit him because he thought he left an injured. After the monster runs away, he asks the wife who she really is, ready for combat. After Gon is able to tell the two nearly identical Kiriko apart, they reveal to be the Navigators and that the couple they ""saved"" are their two children. The daughter states that Kurapika passed the test thanks to his vast knowledge and deduction skills, which allowed him to recognize the chastity symbols on her body and understand that she could not have a husband. Meanwhile, Gon is able to tell 2 identical-looking Kirikos apart, which greatly surprises them. The 2 Kirikos and the husband and wife, who are actually their son and daughter, then explain to the trio how they have qualified for the next test—Kurapika for his vast knowledge onancient symbols, Leorio for his good medical skill and confidence, and Gon for his extraordinary movement and observation. The Kiriko fly all three of them to the exam hall.[10] Kurapika pours out Tonpa's laxative drink When they arrive in Zaban City one of the Kiriko takes them to the secret entrance of the exam hall. Kurapika and Leorio start a debate over why one would become a Hunter, with Kurapika stressing the nobility of securing order, and they both ask Gon what being a Hunter means to him. Before he can reply, they reach the site of the first test, a large tunnel, Kurapika, Leorio, and Gon to see a lot of experts.Tonpa, nicknamed Rookie Crusher, offers each of them a can of his laxative-spiked drink but Kurapika pours it on the floor after Gon claims that it has a bad taste.[11] Kurapika runs alongside Leorio An examiner,Satotz, then appears and tells the candidates to follow him through the tunnel. He runs faster and faster but Kurapika has little problem keeping up with him.[12]While running, he reveals to Leorio the story about the stolen Scarlet Eyes of his people and his determination to retrieve them and capture the Phantom Troupe. The marathon finally ends when they reach theMilsy Wetlands, also known as the Swindler's Swamp.[7] Kurapika waits for the perfect time to run Satotz warns them of the dangers and tells them to follow him through the swamp in another marathon. On the way, Kurapika, Leorio, and a number of other candidates are attacked byHisoka, a man notorious for his bloodthirstiness.[13]All of them are killed in a short time, except for him, Leorio, andCherry, examinee #76. Knowing that they have no chance of winning against Hisoka, they split up in 3 different directions. After a while, Kurapika returns and sees Gon kneeling there with a shocked expression on his face.[14]While running together to the site of the Second Phase, theVisca Forest Preserve, Gon tells him about what happened to him and Leorio.[15] The Second Phase of the exam At the site of the Second Phase, twoGourmet Hunters,MenchiandBuhara, appear. The Second Phase starts with Buhara asking them to cook roast pork. Even though the kind of pig that they need to catch, theGreat Stamp, is the most dangerous pig in the world. Kurapika, his 3 friends, and many other contestants have little difficulties passing the test after they discover that these pigs have a spot of weakness on their foreheads.[15] Kurapika and the others wait for Gon's signal The next test has however proven to be a real problem as the other examiner Menchi asks them to makesushi. Despite having read some books about this dish and his careful analysis of the hints thatHanzo, a contestant from the country ofsushi, and Menchi unintentionally gave away, Kurapika still failed like the rest.[16]When the Second Phase is on the verge of having no qualifier, ChairmanNeteroof the Hunter Association arrives in an airship, criticizes Menchi for losing her temper as an examiner, and tells her to give them another test, which she herself also has to take. This time around Menchi asks them to cook boiledSpider Eagleeggs, which hang from strong strings connecting the two sides of deep ravines. Even though they have to jump into a ravine to find the egg, Kurapika and 41 other examinees pass the test and are subsequently taken to the site of the Third Phase in the Chairman's airship.[17] Kurapika knocks out Majtani The Third Phase of the Hunter Exam starts atop the Trick Tower, which has numerous passages, and they have seventy-two hours to get to the bottom of it alive.[18]Kurapika, Leorio,Killua, and Gon are forced to form a team of 5 with Tonpa to pass through the 1st door.[19]They advance, using the majority rule several times on the way, and their road leads them to a platform set up in the middle of a bottomless abyss where they have to participate in a best-of-five series consisting of 5 no-hold-barred one on one matches against a team of 5 long-term prisoners. Tonpa is the first to fight and he deliberately forfeits the match to undermine his teammates.[20]Gon's match is the second, and thanks to his quick thinking he manages a win to level the score at 1 - 1.[21]The 3rdmatch is Kurapika's and his opponent isMajtani, an impostor with a spider tattoo on his back who brags about his fake Phantom Troupe membership to Kurapika. Enraged, his eyes turn scarlet and he knocks Majtani down with a single punch,[22]however, the match is still going on because he refuses to kill his opponent, who seems to be unconscious.[23] Passing the 3rd Phase of the Hunter Exam Seeing that, Leorio steps in makes a bet that Majtani is still alive, and pretends to drop him into the abyss. Majtani is so scared that he stops playing possum and admits defeat. The score is now 2 - 1 in favor of Kurapika's team but they have lost 40 hours due to betting. Leorio's own match is the 4th, and he loses it after a rock-paper-scissors game along with a bet of ten hours on the gender of his opponent,Leroute.[24]With the score being 2 - 2, Killua quickly kills his opponent,Johnessthe Dissector, in the last match, putting it at 3 - 2 in their favor, but Kurapika's team now have less than 10 hours to reach the bottom.[25]As they advance, they have to use the majority rule some more times and face many other obstacles such as electric quizzes, a multiple-choice labyrinth, mine camps, ""Go"", etc. Thanks to a brilliant idea of Gon's in choosing ways, they manage to reach the bottom of the tower with just thirty seconds left, thus qualifying them for the Fourth Phase.[26] Kurapika kicking Tonpa's face During the Fourth Phase, the remaining examinees are taken toZevil Islandto take part in a 7-day manhunt among themselves to capture each other's number badges.[27]Kurapika's designed target is Tonpa, who in turn has Leorio as his target. After Leorio is tricked by Tonpa andSommyand loses his badge, Kurapika appears, knocks Tonpa down, and asks Leorio to team up with him, to which Leorio agrees.[28]They take the badges #16 and #118 from Tonpa and Sommy.[29] Even though Kurapika already has six points from his own and Tonpa's badges, he still helps Leorio find his targetPonzu, examinee #246.[29]As they are looking for the target, they again encounter Hisoka, who tells them to give him their badges if they want to live. Kurapika says that he will give him the badge #118 which only means 1 point to them, as for the other 3 badges, they will fight with their lives to protect them. Hisoka agrees, lets them go, and takes the badge #118.[30] Kurapika explains anaphylaxis At the end of the sixth day, he and Leorio meet Gon and tell Gon about Ponzu. Gon helps them find her by tracking the smell of the medicine that she uses to defend herself. Finally, they find Ponzu, but together with her they are trapped in a cave full of snakes whose ownerBourbon, examinee #103, is already dead[31]due to anaphylactic shock caused by her bees. Thanks to Gon's bravery and ability to hold his breath for an extended period of time, all of them are able to get out of this situation by using a soporific gas of Ponzu's to make the snakes sleep. Before they go, Gon takes the badge #246 from a sleeping Ponzu and leaves her the badge #103. With this, Kurapika and his 2 friends qualify for the next and also the last phase.[32] Kurapika vs. Hisoka The Final Phase of the Hunter Exam is an elimination tournament with a twist—the winner of a match will be removed from the list and receive his very ownHunter Licenseand the loser will be given more chances, depending on their placement in the bracket.[33]Kurapika's first fight is against Hisoka. After fighting for a while, Hisoka whispers something to him and quits the match, allowing him to become a licensed Hunter.[34]WhenIllumi Zoldyckwants to go murder Gon, Kurapika, Leorio, Hanzo, and some examiners block his way.[35]Later, he also requests that theHunter Associationexamine the nature of Killua's act of murder against another contestant,Bodoro, during the Final Phase and has a brief argument withPokkle, who wins by default thanks to Killua's disqualification, but they make up with each other after the exam has ended.[36]He then decides to go with Gon and Leorio toKukuroo Mountainto rescue Killua from the control ofhis family.[37] Kurapika watches as Gon is beaten by Canary Kurapika, Leorio, and Gon arrive at the entrance of the Zoldyck Estate, theTesting Gate, on Kukuroo Mountain on a tour bus. They tell the old gatekeeper,Zebro, that they are Killua's friends but he says he can not let them enter until they can at least push open the first testing door which weighs four tons, because going into the estate via any other way will result in them getting killed by the huge guard dog namedMike.[38]The trio then accepts Zebro's invitation to stay in his house to train, using his heavy equipment.[39]After 20 days, they are all able to open a testing door and head for the Zoldyck Residence without any problem until they are stopped at another gate by a female attendant namedCanary. She beats Gon up to prevent them from advancing but thanks to Gon's insistence, she becomes more and more reluctant to block their path and finally asks them to save Killua.Kikyo Zoldyckthen appears with her sonKalluto, knocks Canary unconscious, and tells them to leave.[40]Shortly after she and Kalluto leave, Canary regains consciousness and says she is going to lead them to the attendants' room.[41] Next meeting: September 1st, in Yorknew City While staying in the servants' room, they are forced into playing a guessing game with some butlers of the family, which they manage to win. Killua at last arrives and leaves the Zoldyck Estate with them.[42]Kurapika then tells his three friends what Hisoka whispered to him during the Final Phase. He would wait for Kurapika inYorknew City, where the largest auction in the world takes place, on September 1stto tell him some interesting things about the Phantom Troupe. It is 6 months until that day so Kurapika says goodbye to his friends, after telling them that he is going to look for some work as a Hunter and arranges to meet up with them later in Yorknew City in September.[43]"
What does Kurapika warn Mizaistom to do?,choose his next words wisely,Succession contest arc,"Kurapika warns Mizaistom to choose his next words wisely After Leorio agrees to fill one of the two empty spots in theZodiacs, he nominates Kurapika for the remaining spot.Mizaistomapproaches Kurapika to request that he join the Zodiacs and accompany them to theDark Continent. Initially, Kurapika's underlings within the Nostrade Family receive Mizaistom instead of Kurapika, but after Mizaistom restrains them, an annoyed Kurapika steps out to meet him. Mizaistom introduces himself and explains why he came, but is refused by Kurapika. Mizaistom decides to take a different approach and asks Kurapika about his progress retrieving the Scarlet Eyes. Kurapika's eyes turn red and he warns Mizaistom to speak wisely. Mizaistom reveals that while doing a background check for a VIP for the Dark Continent trip, he coincidentally identified the owner of a large number of Scarlet Eyes seen in a video uploaded to a darknet site six months ago, and offers to identify them for Kurapika if he joins the Zodiacs and accompany them to the Dark Continent, though he would have to spend about two months on aship. Kurapika asks if the person would be on board, but Mizaistom remains silent as Kurapika still had not agreed to join him. After a moment of contemplation, Kurapika remembers that his priority is to recover his brethren's stolen eyes by any means necessary, and agrees to Mizaistom's requests. After hearing Kurapika's agreement, Mizaistom holds out a picture and identifies the owner asTserriednich Hui Guo Rou, 4thPrince of theKakin Empire.[88] Kurapika first lays his eyes on the ""last monster"" Kurapika takes a moment while holding Tserriednich's picture and sits in front of a monument, where he keeps the Scarlet Eyes he had managed to recover. He reminisces about his journey so far and thinks of the backgrounds of the people he had threatened, coaxed, and paid off to recover the Eyes. He thinks ofPairo, his now-deceased childhood friend, about the prospect of his journey finally beginning, after he reclaims the last of the Eyes, and wondering what to do after, without home to return to or anyone to welcome him home.[89] Kurapika then takes a car with Mizaistom to theHunter Association's headquarters and calls Leorio to update him on the matter. Leorio repeatedly demands to know his e-mail address, but Kurapika declines each time and changes the topic to ask about Gon. Leorio reassures him that Gon is fine and asks him to come over and help him through the awkwardness of not knowing anyone. Kurapika hangs up while thinking that Leorio doesn't actually have a problem, since he's not bashful. Mizaistom tells Kurapika that Leorio seems to have a lot of faith in him, but Kurapika expresses his uncertainty at his ability being useful in the endeavor, before thanking Mizaistom for letting him know about Tserriednich. Kurapika says he will help as much as he can and prepares to remind Mizaistom about his priorities, but is cut off by Mizaistom who had guessed his thoughts and preemptively told Kurapika that he could prioritize Tserriednich while on board. Mizaistom warns him that dark rumors surround Tserriednich and that he should be careful and aim for an amicable solution. Kurapika smiles faintly and tells Mizaistom that he is better at handling monsters in human skin than the unknown.[89] As they ride, Mizaistom asks Kurapika what he will do with Tserriednich after recovering the Eyes. Kurapika explains that he will yield to most demands and just wants his brethren back. Mizaistom then asks what he would do if Tserriednich resists, and Kurapika sinisterly shares his experience with two others who had said they would rather die than surrender the Eyes, but changed their minds without dying, and shares his expectation that the same would happen with Tserriednich. Mizaistom hopes that that would be the case.[90] Kurapika in the Zodiacs meeting room as the new ""Rat"" Leorio meets Kurapika as he arrives and quietly shares that the mission sounded tougher than expected, before asking Kurapika for his opinion. Kurapika says that he had not heard much but did not believe it to be a problem.Cheadleinterrupts them and leads them to a meeting room, where the rest of the Zodiacs wait. Cheadle introduces them to the other Zodiacs and begins her briefing about TheV5and the results of their past failures at exploring the Dark Continent, at the hands of creatures individually a greater threat than theChimera Ants. She also mentions that they would need to discuss about how they would deal with the currently-detained Beyond, and asks if they have any questions. Kurapika raises a hand and asks how many allies Beyond has within the Association, surprising the other zodiacs with his directness.Kanzaiasks how knows of this, and Kurapika snidely explains that it could be inferred fromNetero's will hinting at Beyond making preparations for the journey until his father's death, and Beyond turning himself as a sign of his confidence in controlling a project of that scale even under confinement, requiring the existence of a trustworthy and competent right-hand man. Cheadle explains the events of the election to Kurapika, who has new questions and is asked by Mizaistom to speak privately with him outside.[1] Kurapika being assigned to the Information Team Mizaistom reveals to Kurapika that he and Cheadle have already begun an internal investigation about the matter and that they reached the same conclusion—that the Zodiacs have a spy among them; and since no one has direct connections to Beyond, all Zodiacs are considered suspects. Mizaistom elaborates that Netero had appointed Pariston as the Vice-Chairman for fun despite objections, though adds that Pariston might be a red herring and not the real spy. He admits to Kurapika that part of the reason he was invited to the Zodiacs was that he is an outsider, and therefore likely unrelated. Kurapika agrees to Mizaistom's request to keep their suspicion of a mole within the Zodiacs a secret, and they return. Kurapika later apologizes to the rest of the Zodiacs for making accusations without having a grasp on the complicated situation within the Association and states that he is willing to use his connections with outlaws to offer information about Beyond and Kakin that government sources could never provide. Cheadle later assigns him to the Information Team with Mizaistom, Pyon, and Saccho in preparation for the voyage to the Dark Continent.[1] One month later, as the289thHunter Examcomes to an end, Pariston informs Ging that his replacement seems to be quite competent, having failed all of Beyond's assassins.Muherrmentions that everyone who could have passed the lie detector test was failed by this guy, and that he might've known about Beyond's escape plan if they had been told the details. Pariston dismisses the possibility since they did not yet have an escape plan.[1] UsingDowsing Chainto test Hunter Exam applicants In a flashback, Kurapika watches the candidates attempt the final test of the 289thHunter Exam, a recording of their answers to a set of questions about the voyage's announcement, using hisDowsing Chainto identify those hiding information. While listening to their Q&A session, he passes one applicant and disqualifies two others: the first for hiding important information, and the second, Muherr, for mixing lies with some truth. Kurapika states his surprise at the number of spies having passed the the psychological test in the first round, and clearing the thermography and lie detector. Next to him, Mizaistom states how impressed he is with Kurapika's ability. Kurapika suggests not overestimating it since the ability's mechanism is still unclear to him. and offers his own interpretation; he can unconsciously perceive minute changes in the target that would otherwise go unnoticed by using the chain as a medium, but normally he would need to be directly in front of the subject.Emperor Timeis able to circumvent this by lettingDowsing Chainwork through a video recording provided he's met the subject beforehand. Kurapika then explains that the ability can only see through trained liars, meaning that if a spy wanted to hide any clues to his identity, he could have somebody erase or alter his memories; that way, since the target does not know he is lying, the chain would most likely stay still. While Mizaistom mulls this over, Kurapika inquires whether there is anyone in the higher ranks of the Hunter Association capable of doing so: if they were on the enemy’s side, they could easily pass all the tests.[91] After some reflection, Mizaistom concludes it impossible, saying that there should not be anyone in the Zodiacs with the ability in question, before explaining why he cannot be completely sure. The Zodiacs used to be aligned by their political orientation, often working with members of the same faction for their missions, discounting Cheadle,Botobai, andGintafrom Mizaistom's suspicions. Furthermore, the Zodiacs agreed to share information on their abilities to promote cooperation between them in light of their new specialized groupings for the Dark Continent voyage. Kurapika asks if he will have to do the same and hears Mizaistom reassure him of the opposite, that he would not press for any details or divulge whatever he hears regarding his ability, but in return would not be able to share the others' abilities with him. Kurapika is relieved and shares that he had been thinking how much of a help Leorio had been as a go-between. Mizaistom concurs.[91] The informant is Saiyu Mizaistom resumes his speculation and summarizes that, to their current knowledge, none of the Zodiacs can alter memories, and they probably don't know anyone who can do it, since he had examined the detailed history of all the past hunts for all members. Kurapika objects that a person with that ability could have been given top-secret missions or worked outside the Association, but according to Mizaistom the results of the Hunter Exam rule out this possibility, since a mole of that caliber within the Association would have taken measures to ensure certain people would not have failed. Mizaistom acknowledges the possibility of some being used as decoys to distract from more powerful spies, but shares that his greatest worry is Pariston’s quiet and quick departure after the election, as only the existence of an ally on the Zodiacs' side would justify it. Kurapika then activatesEmperor Time, offering his help to test the members in secret. As the Zodiacs share information about their abilities, Kurapika watches them through a video camera. He passes Kanzai and three others. Immediately after, hisDowsing Chainstarts to swing, indicating thatSaiyuis the informant.[91] With Mizaistom after watching the video containing Beyond Afterward, Kurapika and Mizaistom watch the recording of the latter's conversation with Beyond. While Beyond was eating, Mizaistom announced the departure date is on August 8th, 35 days from then. KingNasubi Hui Guo Rouhad petitioned directly to V5 for Beyond to attend the eve festival and the departure ceremony, as it would pain him for his benefactor to miss this historical event. Mizaistom promises Beyond he will be free to go to the ceremony, provided he reveals which of the Zodiacs is on his side. After a moment of silence, Beyond stated that Mizaistom is wrong on two things: he knows nothing about any spy, and he doesn't care about any ceremonies. All he knows is that he will have to eat and sleep in that cell for a month, and then wait two more months for the Black Whale to reach the New Continent. Until then, he will behave in Hui Guo Rou's sake even though he'd like to decline all ceremonies, seeing that his true goal lies after the voyage. But since he is still considered a hero and a pioneer who will lead the way to the new world, and that honor is important to Kakin, Beyond is sure they will pressure V5 anyway, and in that case, the Zodiacs themselves will be begging him to attend. At the end of the recording, Kurapika states that Beyond has been telling the truth. Mizaistom concludes that Pariston is the mastermind conspired with Saiyu, and the one plotting to free Beyond.[92] Kurapika suggests they leave Beyond alone until landing since he's not hiding any ulterior motives. Mizaistom remains skeptical as Pariston and Saiyu might still encourage him even if Beyond didn't plan to escape before landing. Kurapika explains why it is unlikely: Beyond’s contract with Kakin includes taking civilians to the ""New Continent"" as he wishes to highlight Hui Guo Rou’s achievement, so he won’t be causing any problems en route. And in the worst-case scenario of him escaping, V5 might turn the ship around, even if it means breaking ties with Kakin. All of which contradicts Beyond's initial decision of announcing a truce and letting himself be captured. Consequently, it would be unwise for them to do anything about Saiyu in the meantime. Mizaistom agrees, but says he'd rather avoid sitting idly while Pariston and his spy are plotting. Kurapika is then given permission to watch the part of the recording where Saiyu explains about his Nen ability . He concludes that Saiyu was much more stable during his explanation, contrary to his proclaimed worry. On the reverse side, the remaining Zodiacs were obviously nervous about the risk of the spy learning about their abilities, yet still desiring to trust the others, which in turn affected their body language; all stereotypical behavior of the innocent. Kurapika surmises that Saiyu was telling the truth about his ability, and he is also on Beyond's side. He then proposes keeping tabs on Saiyu in secret to uncover his plans while gathering evidence. Mizaistom agrees it is safer than tailing him at all times, even if it means leaving him free to act.[92] Kurapika explains his plan to arrest Saiyu right before landing on the New Continent Kurapika states that knowing Saiyu's ability enables them to narrow down possible escape plans. However, if they were to restrain him too soon, Pariston may arrange something else. Kurapika expects them to escape right after the festival on the New Continent. Therefore, the best course of action would be to arrest Saiyu right before landing without Beyond noticing, ideally with some kind of proof to support their claim. In the off-chance of failing to do so, Mizaistom will have to admit he acted on his own in league with the newcomer, much to Kurapika's dismay. Mizaistom confirms his suspicions, stating he will also be criticized after speaking of resolve when in reality he has been working behind their backs to identify the culprit. Some of the Zodiacs might even change their approach to the mission if they find out that Mizaistom's means were based on a farce. Later, Kurapika answers a phone call fromLinssen, who tells him that six of Kakin princes are hiring bodyguards to ""eliminate risk factors"" aboard the ship. None of their identities are shown, only each prince's respective salary.[92] Kurapika hires 5 Hunters so that each can infiltrate a prince’s security detail Kurapika hires Izunavi, Hanzo, Basho, Melody, andBiscuit Krueger—whom was recommended to him by Killua—so that the six of them can apply to all offers, and he can get closer to his main target, Prince Tserriednich. After a brief clash with Biscuit, he remembers Killua's advice and pacifies her with flattering. Looking at the six offers, he tries to deduce which of the anonymous employers could be PrinceHalkenburg, who appears to have a close relationship with Tserriednich. In hopes of finding his client, he singles out two offers that state the prince will personally conduct the interview, as it shows signs of maturity and confidence. One has the highest pay as a result of the one-upping competition, and the other's pay never changed. Kurapika surmises Halkenburg is most likely the latter as it signifies his strong self-esteem and self-control.[93] Kurapika holds Prince Woble He sends his request and heads to a hotel managed by Hui Guo Rou, where he is surprised to discover that his employer is, in fact, QueenOito, mother of Fourteenth PrinceWoble. The Queen reveals the reason it was decided the offers had to be anonymous was to fend off assassins from infiltrating the popular princes' security. Halkenburg figured this much and did not put up a post. On the other hand, Queen Oito is looking for guards that would try to contact Halkenburg, seeing most of them are either assassins or fake followers, which would simplify a give-and-take relationship. The assassins will get to wait for their chance while protecting them, and the followers plotting to manipulate Halkenburg can learn his weaknesses. Queen Oito explains that pro guards only specialize in protecting dignitaries, and are not trained in proactively killing someone before she reveals the Black Whale voyage will turn into a war due to the rules of Kakin's succession as enforced by Nasubi. When Prince Halkenburg becomes the next King, and if this succession battle becomes public, he will be the one to suffer the most damage. For that reason, she hopes to buy hers and Woble's safety by blackmailing Halkenburg with his participation. She tells Kurapika if he accepts the job, she will give ten times the promised pay provided he can get them off the ship alive. And if he leaves now, he'll still be paid the promised fee if he keeps this conversation confidential. Kurapika agrees to protect her, so far as his terms are respected. Oito agrees and tells him about the gap in status between higher and lower wives. After reminiscing about her past life, she lets Kurapika hold her daughter.[93] Kurapika senses an aura radiating from Woble's cradle Sometime later, Kurapika boards the ship with Oito and Woble. He repeats the security measures before thinking to himself that the battle strength of his side is weak, especially since some Hunters may be spies. He has a phone conversation with Mizaistom, during which the latter informs him of the conditions of the three lower decks, leading Kurapika to think the meeting of the Zodiacs will be called off. He warns Oito that if something unexpected happens, they may be able to flee to the lower decks, escaping the succession war. While he contacts the system control room, he is startled by aura radiating off Woble's cradle.[94] Kurapika questions the bodyguards and servants Oneof Oito's bodyguards is found dead in a toilet, all blood drained out of him. Kurapika inspects the body and concludes the culprit may have used Nen; however, the bodyguards who are not Hunters have never heard of it, while the Hunters do not say anything. He later confronts them about their silence, causing them to reply they are surprised he disclosed the information. From their conversation, Kurapika gleans he is the only one who knows about the succession war, meaning Pariston may be unaware of it as well. When the corpses of four more bodyguards are found, Kurapika conjures hisDowsing Chain, and, pointing a gun at his colleagues, states he will shoot them if they lie.[95] Several Guardian Spirit Beasts creep into Prince Woble's living quarters The assistants and Hunters are revealed to be innocent, but the other two guards admit each of them is working for a higher ranking queen. They are tied to chairs before they continue their confession. From what they say, Kurapika infers Woble has received a Nen ability, which is probably triggered by her self-defense instinct. Kurapika deduces Woble sensedWoody's malice and killed him. However, he has trouble accepting Woble could have learned Nen in one month, butBilltells him it would be possible with parasitic type Nen. At that point, theNen beastsof multiple princes swarm into the room. Kurapika quickly contacts Melody and Biscuit. The latter tells him that there were Nen beasts in their quarters, but only the Hunters were able to see them, leading her to believe it is a parasitic type ability. Kurapika has Bill tell him everything he knows about that type of Nen and later accepts to reveal his agenda to improve cooperation. WhenSayirdstabsKurtonand the two restrained bodyguards to death, Kurapika prepares to fight him to take him alive.[96] Kurapika loadsStealth Dolphinwith the stolen abilityLittle Eye Kurapika manages to subdue Sayird and asks Bill if he's one of the important people mentioned. Bill claims that Kurton was more important due to his transformation skills. So Kurapika then tries to interrogate Sayird on his Nen type andability, but to no avail. Although Bill first is against such a personal question, Kurapika convinces him due to the situation at hand and he reveals Sayird's Nen type and a brief explanation of his Nen ability. In a flashback Kurapika has, Izunavi advises him to focus on co-operation with allies. Back in the present Kurapika uses his index finger's ability to steal Sayird's Nen ability, while forcing him to go into a state similar toZetsu. With Sayird's power stolen and aura drained the Nen beast that was manipulating him escapes, while Kurapika summons a Nen dolphin that equips the power and gives a little more detailed explanation of Sayird's Nen ability. No longer of use and to use less energy, theStealth Dolphinis put on stand by. Regaining consciousness and now restrained, Sayird explains what happened to him and, before being taken away by the Kakin Empire army for questioning, explains his Nen ability in greater detail to Kurapika. With only Kurapika and Bill left to protect Prince Woble, Kurapika inquires what options they now have, now that Kurton is dead. Bill expounds that they have to either ask Pariston Hill or, harder still, Beyond Netero to leave theBlack Whale.[97] After listening to the rest of his explanation concerningparasitic typeNen, Kurapika concludes the real battle will start once all princes are back from the ceremony.[98] The two review their options, with Kurapika refusing to use Sayird's ability due to the lack of information on the other princes. WhenVincentarrives, he immediately killsone of Oito's attendantswith the excuse of acting in self-defense, which leads Kurapika to realize he's not there as a spy, but as an assassin.[99] Kurapika transfersLittle Eyeto Queen Oito Kurapika considers attacking Vincent, but quickly gives up when he surmises even an act of self-defense would be held against him due to PrinceBenjamin's influence. He raises his hands and declares Vincent is the biggest threat to Woble's life. The hitman replies by asking him to ""cooperate"", by which he implies he wants the two Hunters' help in murdering Oito and Woble, leading Kurapika to insult him mentally. Removing his contact lenses, he turns to the queen and asks her if she trusts him. When Woble reaches her hands towards him, Oito declares she has the utmost faith in him. Kurapika then stabs her withSteal Chain, transferringLittle Eyeto her. As Bill attacks Vincent, Kurapika steals the latter's ability and restrains his hand. He accuses Vincent of wanting to kill Woble, which Vincent denies, but Oito promises she'll testify against him. Noticing his earpiece, Kurapika states he has an ability that can force him to tell the truth. Defeated, Vincent commits suicide by drinking poison hidden in one of his back teeth. Kurapika calmly states it could not be avoided and points the earpiece to an agitated Bill, crushing it only after giving anyone who might be overhearing misleading information.[100] Kurapika wonders if he should wait until the next banquet and have Oito useLittle Eyeon PrinceMarayam's hamster, but due to the backlash ofEmperor Time, he quickly realizes it is an impossible plan. Thus, he explainsLittle Eyeto the queen and instructs her to use it on a fly or mosquito. He then declines the dolphin-like construct, which asks him if it should equip Vincent's ability. He orders Bill to search the room andShimanoto answer the phone. The maid informs him there are three princes wishing to speak to him: Prince Benjamin, PrinceZhang Lei, and PrinceTubeppa. Since speaking with any of them first would be interpreted as an act of disrespect towards the others, who'd also believe him to be allied with the first prince he spoke to, and not replying would be a declaration of war, Kurapika reflects on his next move, while Benjamin'snew envoyarrives.[100] Kurapika and Queen Oito arrive at Prince Zhang Lei's quarters Confident that Benjamin believes him to be aManipulator, he decides to speak to him and asks Bill to keep watch onBabimynawith Gyo, but he is surprised when he discovers Shimano has connected him with Zhang Lei. At the prince's request, Kurapika explains he decided to answer him because he would be the most open to discussion, but refuses to disclose any more particulars as they are likely to be related to the reason he was called: Nen. After Oito and Woble are allowed to come along, Kurapika accepts to meet the prince in 15 minutes. He finds out Benjamin has hung up, but Tubeppa is still waiting. Her guardMaoroffers to exchange information regarding Nen beasts. When the bodyguard declares he is about to come over, Kurapika replies they have a private soldier of the first prince in front of their door, and letting Maor in but not to him may have consequences. They agree to meet in one hour. Kurapika then interrogates Shimano about her disobedience. Finding her explanation—Zhang Lei being likely more open to discussion than Benjamin, whose soldier they have killed and who was unlikely to be on the phone himself—convincing, he consults her about the best course of action to take with Babimyna, to which she replies they have to let him or they will be detained by the army, which would allow Benjamin to kill Oito and Woble. With newfound respect for her, Kurapika contacts Benjamin's private soldier and informs him they are going to meet Zhang Lei. Babimyna resolves to wait in the room together with Bill. Kurapika, Oito, and Woble thus reach Zhang Lei, who offers them bottles of water to drink. Kurapika immediately begins his explanation, which is partially directed at Oito, who is able to see Zhang Lei's Sacred Beast. Declaring the next piece of information could potentially affect the outcome of the succession war, he asks Zhang Lei if he intends to continue their conversation with the bodyguardsCoventobaandSlakkawho are spies sent by other Queens and Princes in the room.[101] The Prince pretends not to mind, but points out Kurapika likely has an appointment with either Tubeppa or Benjamin afterward, and gives Oito two of his own bodyguardsSakataandHashito. Under QueenUnma's orders, Slakka goes with them too. On the intercom, Kurapika quickly checks on Bill and, after entering, updates him. With the number of enemies in their midst, Kurapika starts to get nervous due toEmperor Time's lifespan-shaving condition, since he cannot have Oito use Sayird's ability.[102] Kurapika plans to demonstrate Nen to the bodyguards by manipulating a cockroach in order to activateLittle Eye In order to have Shimano and Bill search the room for bugs, Kurapika proposes the other bodyguards and Bill follows him in the bedroom. This results in a brief argument with Babimyna, which is won by Kurapika when he states he's doing it for the queen's peace of mind, as people were killed in the hall. Kurapika begins his explanation about Nen and theGuardian Spirit Beastprotecting the princes, but is shocked to spot a cockroach on the ceiling. As he wonders what to do with it, Oito orders the bodyguards to catch it, feigning disgust. Kurapika summons Bill and Shimano and orders the former to catch it with Nen, allegedly in order to prove the truthfulness of what he told the guards. Bill and Oito understand his plan, which leads to its success: while Bill pretends to send out his aura, the queen utilizesLittle Eyethrough Kurapika's dolphin construct. Kurapika then resumes his lecture, asking Babimyna for confirmation. He then proposes to teach Nen to all bodyguards within two weeks, stating the princes will decide if they should participate or not. To himself, he notes Babimyna's refinedEnand speculates the soldier already knows that it was Oito who gained control of the roach.[103] Kurapika collapses after mishandlingStealth Dolphin An hour later, Kurapika sees Oito turn the page of her notebook, from which he infers she finished investigating the first prince. However, he worries about his remaining stamina, as his eyes have been scarlet for about 3 hours. The queen suddenly screams that Momoze is being murdered in the next room. To save appearances in front of Babimyna, Kurapika pretends she only had a nightmare, but she knocks his hand away and insists on checking. Kurapika tasks Bill with it. As the prince's corpse is taken away from her room, Kurapika reflects the accident is worrying, as the timing seems suspect. Sakata interrupts his musings by demanding to know why Momoze's beast failed to protect her. Kurapika replies her unusual sleeping pattern may be related, and that both things were probably consequences of the said beast being one of the two that attacked the other bodyguards. Despite acknowledging her mental state, Kurapika reasons he has to ask the queen to keep usingLittle Eye. When Babimyna asks Oito why she screamed, Kurapika realizes he knew about the queen all along and is surprised when he withdraws with the other guards and removes his En. Oito agrees to keep spying on the Princes, but specifies she is doing it for her daughter and not Kurapika. As she takes notes, Bill informs Kurapika some princes have already accepted his offer, but there are two problems. The first is the number of bodyguards, and Kurapika suggests they limit them to two per prince. Due to the fatigue caused by his Scarlet Eyes, Kurapika passes out before he can hear the second.[104] Prince Woble responds to Kurapika's vow for the second time 9 hours later, he regains consciousness. Bill, who hid his fainting fit from the other bodyguards, tells him Oito passed out when he did. Kurapika grows horrified at the thought thatEmperor Timehas remained active for that long and questions its limit. He then asks the queen to resume her surveillance from the 4th Prince instead of the 12th. Oito becomes suspicious of his motives, but Kurapika explains that is the best move, as the first prince and probably the second have Nen users among their guards, and they are allies with the third, while they know nothing about the third. Kurapika then kneels in front of her, swearing again her and Woble's lives are his priority. When Woble reaches for him, he lets her touch his fingers. Oito thus agrees but, mere moments later, she screams in terror. Kurapika passes her shout off as a nightmare to dismiss the guards who came running, and she tells him that a woman, whom Kurapika speculates to be Tserriednich's Spirit Guardian Beast, killed the cockroach. Kurapika's ability is thus dispelled, but the fatigue caused by the prolonged use of his Scarlet Eyes does not decrease. When Oito asks him to teach her Nen, Kurapika apologizes, as lending her a Nen ability had the side effect of opening her aura nodes.[105] Kurapika supervises the 16 participants of the Nen training Not much later, at 9 a.m., the lessons begin. After all the participants have gathered around him, Kurapika, with his back to Oito's quarters, draws a line on the ground with white adhesive tape, demanding that no one cross it, lest they be forced to leave or he'll use force without warning.Myuhanimmediately steps on it, causing Kurapika to ask his name and affiliation. Dropping the tape, he states that will be Myuhan's final warning. Myuhan pretends not to have noticed and apologizes, but threatens Kurapika and indirectly asks him if he is simply planning on stalling them. The Hunter promises once again they will all learn Nen in two weeks. He then retorts that if all Myuhan can do is speak in a provocative manner, it says a lot about his prince, causing the guard to lose his cool. Kurapika immediately draws his gun, butDanjinholds back his fellow bodyguard and apologizes on their behalf.[106] Kurapika starting the group's Nen training Kurapika suggests everyone state their name and affiliation. He subsequently repeats the purpose of the meetings, ensuring that even though there will be differences in individual proficiency, everyone will learn Nen in the promised time. To make the lessons go smoothly, he asks if anyone can already use Nen.BelerainteandFurykovraise their hands, and Kurapika nominates them, supervisors. An unknown Nen ability suddenly attacks and killsBarrigen, with Sakata shooting the white snakes that crawl out of his clothes. Kurapika notices Zhang Lei's guards use 9mm bullets, which are hard to defend against even with Gyo, thinking he should also expect .45 caliber and HK handguns. He quickly deduces the attacker is not a Guardian Spirit Beast, but an assassin in their midst.[106]He forbids his students from using firearms no matter the circumstances. He gives everyone 15 minutes to decide if they want to continue and heads to Oito's room. He uses hisDowsing Chainto ask Bill and Shimano if they are the users ofSilent Majority, earning a negative response in both cases. He explains to her that due to the usage of Conjuration in the ability, it cannot be Woble's Guardian Spirit Beast, which leads him to speculate that, due to the complex system of Vows and Limitations that must be in place, it is possible that if one prince dropped out of the succession war, all Nen beasts would disappear. When he goes back to the hall, nobody has withdrawn. He begins his lesson and has Belerainte and Furykov check on everyone's aura flow.[107] Kurapika testing Yuhirai Kurapika confrontsSheduleandYuhiraiabout their copious aura output, unattainable for a real beginner. For safety and secrecy reasons, he agrees to speak with one of them at the end of the lecture. Sakata insists on participating, using his superior experience and the deal with Prince Zhang Lei as leverage. Kurapika is reluctant, but Yuhirai gives his consent, stating Prince Halkenburg would do anything to put a stop to the succession war. Yuhirai explains about his strange mark, which Kurapika suspects to be the work of asoliciting-type Manipulationability. The two convene it is related to the prince's Nen beast and that it serves as a symbol of unity, expressing a contradiction inside Halkenburg: he wants to put an end to the monarchy, and the fastest way would be to win the succession contest, but he refuses to participate; however, his Guardian Spirit Beast wants to fight. Kurapika tests Yuhirai, determining he has not fully awakened to Nen and warns him that if Halkenburg really wants everyone to be the same, the Limitations that are probably in place risk being severe and affecting everyone who bears his mark. He manages to convince him Queen Oito wants to escape the contest too, adding that the lower princes must band together or they'll be killed off one by one. He then resolves to contact each of them via the Hunter Association.[108] Vergei refusing to cooperate with Kurapika Kurapika returns to Room 1014. Unable to return to his real body, Hanzo enlists his help. Due to clearance issues, Kurapika replies the most can do is ask Halkenburg's guards to contact Room 1013 for him, but he will be able to do so only the following day. Shimano informs Kurapika that theCaptain of the Guards of Prince Marayamis on the phone and would like to speak to him.[109]Kurapika attempts to convince Vergei the room he is in has been isolated due to a Nen ability, but the bodyguard ignores him and requests that he investigate about the identity of Momoze's killer. When Kurapika reveals he already knows who the culprit is, Vergei initially pretends to be accommodating, accepting to open the door to a Hunter Association member in exchange for the information, but then asserts that he is not convinced by the rumors spreading about Nen, which seem too convenient for the Hunters. Still hoping to form an alliance, Kurapika tells him that the killer wasTuffdyand how he carried out the murder. Vergei states that Kurapika's explanation has only strengthened his belief that the Hunter Association intends to weaken Kakin from the inside and hangs up.[110] Kurapika relays his impressions to Hanzo and asks him to stay in Room 1013. He warns the ninja that Vergei might suspect the presence of a mole in their midst since he did not inquire about his sources. When Hanzo asks him what he ought to do next, Kurapika tells him to prioritize finding information on how to ensure Prince Marayam's safety. When Hanzo leaves, with Babimyna's consent, Kurapika answers Sakata's questions about Room 1013, adding that he suspects the Nen beast of the Thirteenth Prince to be involved. Meanwhile, he wonders about Babimyna's conduct.[110] Belerainte helping Kurapika At 10:00 a.m. of the following day the lessons resume, but Myuhan is killed bySilent Majorityas soon as he steps into the toilet. While giving dispositions to everyone else in the room, Kurapika surmises the user can see and control the snakes from afar, which likely makes them a Manipulator.Satobiand Maor accuse Kurapika's faction of being responsible for the attacks and of using the lectures as bait. The Rat acknowledges that the circumstantial evidence might be enough to indict all of them, which could result in Oito and Woble being imprisoned separately. Belerainte comes to Kurapika's aid and insists that if the lectures stop, the real culprit will get away and everyone will lose their chance to study the other princes' defenses. Kurapika asks to speak to the Hunter in private and thanks him. Belerainte requests to talk to Bill for 10 minutes, so as to make his report to Room 1013 without seeming to talk to himself.[111] Kurapika introducing the Water Divination test Over the next few days, the lectures continue without the user ofSilent Majoritymaking another move. On Friday, he feelsan incredibly powerful aura, but he resolves to keep his calm so as not to weaken his own Nen.[112]The morning after the banquet, during one of the lectures, Kurapika and Bill feel the rumbling aura surge again. They conclude it comes from an odd-numbered room. Kurapika assures Sakata that its signature is different from the one of Prince Zhang Lei's Guardian Spirit Beast and that therefore it is unlikely that it belongs to him. From the way it swells before disappearing abruptly, Kurapika estimates that it is an Emission ability, which might be able to go through walls. Sakata then says that Kurapika's students are starting to have doubts about the training due to repeating the same exercise over and over. Kurapika replies that he will start the next stage the following day and performs the Water Divination test as a Specialist in front of them.[113] Yuri using Bill's ability throughStealth Dolphin After explaining its purpose, he pointsLadiolusas his most advanced disciple to provoke some of the other bodyguards into being competitive. He states that one's Nen category should never be revealed and that the screenings will be conducted in a separate room and witnessed only by Bill and him. When Maor, Satobi, and Danjin object, Kurapika justifies his decision with the requirements of the training, the risk he took by showing his own Nen type, and his camp's wish for a stalemate, which means that he has no intention of gathering intelligence to hurt the higher-ranked princes. Once again, he adds that if they cannot accept his conditions, they can drop off the training.[113]One by one, Kurapika invites Ladiolus, Maor,Yuri, and Satobi into the main bedroom. There, contrary to what he told them, he does not have them perform Water Divination, but, after receiving their consent, he forces their Aura Nodes open withStealth Dolphinand briefly gives them Bill'sErigeronability. He then enforces a gag order preventing anyone from disclosing what transpired until every one of his students has, supposedly, taken the test, lest the training be canceled.[114] When the lesson ends, he thanks Bill for revealing his ability and, when the latter calls himself a coward for choosing Room 1014 to guard because he believed he could avoid major fights and for resolving to stay out of shame, Kurapika points out that cowards do not steel themselves as he did. Hashito approaches him, demanding to be taught Nen right away in return for allowingTenftoryto be awakened last. Kurapika accepts, but warns Hashito that, since he has not taken the training, he will be too exhausted to even move for a while afterward.[114] At 11:30 of the tenth day the rumbling aura can be felt again. Kurapika observes that the intervals between one surge and the next are becoming shorter.[114] During their conversation after observing 11thPrinceFugetsu's rapidly deteriorating state,Melodypleads withKaiserto be released on bail to find out what happened to Fugetsu. Kaiser is forced to refuse her, citing an inability to refuse any orders to perform they wish to avoid. Melody asks him to instead visit Kurapika in Room 1014 and tell him everything, since Kurapika is the only one she trusts. Kaiser wonders if she really means everything, and Melody stresses that they can't waste any time, asking him to hurry.[115] At 11:45 a.m. during lessons on the tenth day of the voyage, Kurapika and Bill inviteLonghiinto Room 1014's master bedroom in order to privately initiate her with Nen, as they did with her unawakened classmates.[115]Kurapika lets Longhi enter first and joins her and Bill at a table after shutting the door, facing Longhi with Oito and Woble behind him.[116] Before Kurapika and Bill can begin, Longhi declines the divination and volunteers that she can already use Nen. Kurapika and Bill are surprised and begin to react to her statement. Longhi activates herMoonlight Actto establish a Nen-based contract, simultaneously proving she was not the killer of Barrigen and Myuhan. Longhi explains thatMoonlight Actallows her to loan her ability or to restrict the actions of those that voluntarily sign a limited-term contract of hers, and asks Kurapika to hold off on agreeing or disagreeing to an alliance with Tubeppa in the contract before she finishes explaining her terms.[116] Longhi reveals that Tubeppa is unaware of her ability, and unaware of her ability to use Nen in general. She explains that her contract is insurance to guarantee that hertrue plangoes smoothly. Kurapika activates hisDowsing Chainand aims a gun at her, preparing to shoot her if she lies. Longhi asks why he bothers, pointing out that a Nen user cannot be killed with a .22 caliber handgun, but Kurapika does not respond. Longhi continues by sharing that her ability requires her to explain the whole truth first, and that telling Kurapika the details of a contract between him and Tubeppa would suffice if that were her only goal, but reveals that for her true plan, she wants to grant Kurapika additional power with her ability and has to explain everything about the true plan in order to do so.[116] Longhi reveals that she is Beyond Netero's daughter, and pauses to let the weight of her words sink in. After a short pause, Kurapika asks her to contine. Longhi reveals that she, like many others, were raised to parents in a marriage arranged by Beyond, and put in the Royal Military Academy. She explains that she had thought her purpose was to be someone that Beyond placed in important positions close to the next king of Kakin. Longhi confirms Kurapika's understanding that what she had just explained was what she originally believed was her true plan. Kurapika watches intently as Longhi continues to explain what she earlier believed was Beyond's plan.[116] Longhi mentions that she could use Nen as an infant as a side effect of Beyond's Nen attack, and that newborns with Nen instinctively learnt Ten and Zetsu to prevent fatigue. Kurapika asks her to elaborate what she means by attack, and Longhi reveals a mark below her tongue for Kurapika to see using Gyo, the mark of a curse that many of her half-siblings had, varying in strength between the half-siblings, which she believed was meant to curse a prince upon her death. Bill reminds Kurapika that taking too long would draw the suspicion of others, but Kurapika insists on hearing all of the story so that they can form a contract with Tubeppa. Kurapika confirms with Longhi that she is sure that her target is a Prince, despite not knowing who it is. After she confirms it, Kurapika agrees with Bill's speculation that Beyond left it to fate to increase its power using Nen limitations. Kurapika adds on that Beyond is in Kakin's innermost circles and so likely just wants Benjamin to take the throne. He points out that sacrificing a life is necessary for a powerful curse and that if Beyond gave Benjamin such a hint to ensure his survival, Benjamin could use his special martial law as a last resort.[116] Longhi disagrees with Kurapika's reasoning, surprising him. Longhi expresses her belief that Beyond would not expend the effort he did for someone unrelated to him. Kurapika catches on to what she says. Longhi sees him understand, and explicitly states her belief that Beyond had fathered one of Kakin's 14 Princes. Kurapika asks Oito what the requirements for a Prince's participation in the contest are, and Oito replies that there was no mention of paternal lineage in the requirements.[116] A knock comes on the door, and Sakata asks Kurapika if anything was wrong. Kurapika deactivates hisDowsing Chain, puts his gun away, and steps out to reassure the participants that they were fine, and gives the explanation that negotiations were taking a while because they could not agree on the terms of the truce. Kurapika promises to explain it fully afterwards to clear up any doubt the participants have, and asks them for their patience. Furykov observes Kurapika when he steps out, and wonders what they were talking about, believing that they had noticed that Longhi was responsible for Barrigen and Myuhan's deaths but noting no change in Kurapika's aura.[116] Kurapika returns to the master bedroom. He closes the door, then reactivatesDowsing Chainand redraws his gun. Longhi begins to explain the details of the contract she wants to have Kurapika agree to. She begins by explaining the contract with Tubeppa and its details:[116] Kurapika makes sure to have Longhi clarify the definition of ""attack"", and she does so before promising to write Kurapika another contract if Tubeppa drops out before he can help her and explaining her additional stipulations for her true plan:[116] Kurapika notes thatDowsing Chainhas not indicated that Longhi is lying. Having finally explained everything, Longhi asks Kurapika to listen to one final request before signing, and reveals her current true plan—should Beyond's child be among the Princes, to kill them herself. She laments at Beyond's control over her, saying that she would have never made the decision to do so if Beyond had told her everything.[116] Kurapika agrees to Longhi's contract, and agrees to collaborate with Tubeppa.[115]The participants watch the three step out. Furykov feels something slightly different from before in Kurapika's aura, but is unable to discern if it's a change in himself or if it was Longhi's Nen. Furykov wonders if his deduction that Longhi was the assassin was incorrect. Kurapika invites Tenftory in and mentions that he would be the last to have his Nen awakened that day, saying that he would discuss the matter afterward.[116]Tenftory later reports to Zhang Lei that all of the students who have taken Kurapika's Nen training are able to utilize Nen.[117] Later, at 1:30 p.m. on the tenth day of the voyage, Tenftory in Room 1003 and Maor and Longhi in Room 1005 simultaneously give their Princes an update on the succession contest. Tenftory tells Zhang Lei that Woble and Tubeppa had agreed to defer the throne to him if they were the final three Princes, in exchange for Sakata and Hashito extending their support indefinitely. Coventoba observes their conversation. Maor tells Tubeppa that Kurapika had entered their truce and agreed to their alliance on the condition that Oito and Woble accompany him whenever he comes to Room 1005. Rihan, watching their conversation nearby, notes that Tubeppa's team were colluding with Kurapika.[118] In Kaiser's office on Tier 2 at 8:50 a.m. on the eleventh day, Melody hopes that the Kurapika would come up with a plan so that no more Princes had to die, as he reads a letter similar in appearance to the one that Fugetsu had passed to the other Princes, containing information that Kaiser and Melody had decided to leak to each Prince.[118] In Room 1014 sometime that day, Kurapika speaks to Oito and tells her that death is the punishment awaiting anyone who tries to leave the ship during the succession, and that unfortunately, the ship itself is the urn for the worm toxin. Otio disappointedly understands that the Princes must continue until only one is left alive. Kurapika interjects and says that while it was true that the powerful Nen enveloping the ship makes it seem that nothing but death is allowed, he thinks that there is hope, surprising Oito. He asks her for her permission to go public with her letter, during the second round of the Nen workshop, scheduled to begin the next day. Attendance will be up to the Princes, and he plans to let them know that he would make the letter public during the lessons, for three reasons:[119] In Room 1003 at roughly the same time, Zhang Lei gathers his guards and try to figure out the functionality of the coins his Guardian Spirit Beast had produced. They see that most coins have a '1' on it although one coin had a '10' on it, but get nowhere meaningful. Zhang Lei decides that he needs Kurapika to get through identifying information on Nen that could affect the battle for the throne, as well as his Guardian Spirit Beast's ability and effects, and asks for Room 1014 to be contacted.[119] Sometime after 1:00 p.m.,[120]Kurapika makes his way to Room 1003, together with Oito and Woble.[119]There, he tells Zhang Lei that he had pretty much confirmed his guess that the coins change after ten days. Kurapika says that there should be an upper limit to how many coins can be produced in order to maintain their physical forms, though in Zhang Lei's case the costs are shared by distributing them to others which makes mass production possible.[120] Kurapika points out that the point of currency is to change hands and suggests verifying what changes occur in that case. He starts by asking if there are any differences in design between the ones he has and the ones given to others. Tenftory notices that his coin has a different design and brings it to them to for them to see. They notice that though the front is the same, the back designs are different—Tenftory's coin has an image of Zhang Lei inscribed, but Zhang Lei's coin has an image of his Guardian Spirit Beast inscribed.[120] In order to see what happens when coins are exchanged, Kurapika asks Zhang Lei to give one of his coins to Tenftory, but Zhang Lei instead decides to give Kurapika the '10' coin. Kurapika is surprised and worried but does so in case he loses Zhang Lei's trust by refusing the coin. Kurapika reassures himself by thinking that even if accepting the coin was the condition for activating a semi-coercive manipulation ability, the Nen stored in a coin over ten days is not enough to force powerful commands like murder to be followed. Since only one coin was produced a day and they take ten days to change, Kurapika sees that it is a long-term outlook, an ability that will only demonstrate its true value after Zhang Lei becomes king which reflects his personality to plan ahead, from which Kurapika concludes that accepting the coin is safe enough for now.[120] When Kurapika accepts the coin, it is engulfed in a small burst of aura, and design on the back changes from an inscription of Zhang Lei's Guardian Spirit Beast to an inscription of Zhang Lei. He notes that the number and design changed to match Tenftory's, and Zhang Lei guesses that a coin's time and effect reset when it changes hands. Kurapika returns the coin back to Zhang Lei, and the two note that the design returned to an inscription of Zhang Lei's Guardian Spirit Beast, but the number did not revert back to '10' and remained as '1'.[120] After observing this, Kurapika says that he now has a rough idea of his ability. He asks if he should share his theory there, but Zhang Lei says he does not mind, and guarantees that it was not something that would threaten Benjamin. Kurapika picks up on Zhang Lei's implicit instructions to not reveal how the ability could be a threat, and gets a better idea of Zhang Lei and how to work with him. Kurapika tells Zhang Lei that his beast can be presumed to have a cumulative conjuration ability; contrary to normal currency that is to be circulated, Zhang Lei's coins are instead to be held long-term to store Nen, perhaps enabling them to exhibit various powers later on. Kurapika suggests that in about six months, the owner of the coin could have their aura nodes opened, making them ready to be use Nen. Kurapika suggests that Zhang Lei's estimate of the number reaching 1064could be the required amount for a Nen ability to manifest, and that this might be an optimal way to bypass the normally rigorous training needed to learn Nen and the risks involved. He also says that a cumulative ability is often seen in intellectual people and those who like to head, suggesting that the ability prepares for a time after Zhang Lei assumes the throne.[120] Zhang Lei laughs in delight at how fitting the ability Kurapika suggests is for him. In line with his understanding of Zhang Lei's instructions, Kurapika keeps his ideas on how the coins could threaten others to himself. He thinks that in exchange for awakening Nen using a method as close to risk- and cost-free as possible, Zhang Lei's Guardian Spirit Beast requires compensation, likely in the form of pseudo-coercive manipulation, or semi-forced loyalty to Zhang Lei.[120] Kurapika decides to keep these thoughts to himself since it would make unnecessary waves and also wants to let the coin do its things and see its effects on Coventoba, who Kurapika guesses hid the coin that appeared on the first day. Since it was the eleventh day and most abilities that counted days as a condition take the moment of emergence as the first day, Kurapika guesses that there should have been two '10' coins, and since Zhang Lei only had one, Kurapika guesses that Coventoba, the only one present who can use Nen and is not affiliated with Zhang Lei, had picked it up and kept it to himself because he is aware of what going on and did not want to give information with Zhang Lei. Kurapika also notes that Coventoba's presence at their discussion could be used as an excuse to explain why he did not share the possibility that his coins had a manipulative ability, since Zhang Lei did not want Kurapika to mention anything about the ability that could be a threat to Benjamin.[120] Zhang Lei thanks Kurapika, and says that he can now spend his time thinking about how to spend his future with his siblings. Kurapika points out that the number of coins Zhang Lei holds could also have an effect, and suggest that he hold on to some coins for now. Zhang Lei agrees and decides to give Kurapika the coin that appeared that day, but hold on to the rest for now. Kurapika thanks him, and says that he needs to ask Zhang Lei to wait a while longer for their other matter, and says that his second round of Nen lessons should be key. Zhang Lei acknowledges this and says that there can never be too much information, but it is not urgent and that he is more worried about Kurapika and Woble's security detail. Zhang Lei advises him that it was likely that others had used the first round of Nen lessons to gather intel and lay their groundwork, and suggests that Kurapika prepare himself. Zhang Lei thinks to himself and internally tells Kurapika not to think of them as equals, that he was only accepting information in exchange for ensuring Woble's safety.[120] Kurapika thanks Zhang Lei for his concern, and thinks about how it was extremely beneficial to be under Zhang Lei's protection in exchange for information on Nen pertaining to the succession battle, despite the great risks it comes with. Zhang Lei is one of the three Princes that were benefactors to a Mafia family and the combat potential of the over two hundred mafia members on board the lower Tiers served as inhibition against the higher Princes. Kurapika notes that the power balance between Zhang Lei, Tserriednich, and Luzurus is important, and the situation could change drastically if it tipped too far. If the balance between the mafia breaks, Benjamin has reason to enact martial law and place all the Princes under house arrest under the guise of protection, where he has free reign to do as he wishes. Because the balance between the mafia families and their associated Princes was so stable, war breaking out is likely to lead to the assassination of a Prince, and if a Prince's death is interpreted as a mafia hit, the resulting mafia war would lead to martial law. Kurapika worries that Benjamin might go after one of the three mafia Princes to force this situation, and that given his personality, might even kill Woble despite Zhang Lei living with her, to emphasize the cruelty of the mafia and shift the blame onto them.[120] Kurapika considers staying in Room 1014 where each Prince's guards served as a check for the others, but worries about thesnakesand the danger that each Prince is plotting something. Which choice to make is up to his gut decision, but they are on thin ice either way.[120] Back in Room 1014, Kurapika notifies the guards of the other Princes' present in Room 1014 that the second round of Nen classes would begin the next morning at 9 a.m. He first speaks to Babimyna, and lets him know that the format would be the same as before, but Camilla's guards would join this time. Babimyna confirms for Kurapika that he and Furykov would continue to be Benjamin's representatives, then Kurapika asks Sakata and Hashito for ideas on why Camilla might have changed her mind about sending representatives. Sakata suggests she might be verifying Kurapika's claims, and that since they know what happened because of the last round of Nen lessons, there must be some benefit for Camilla's side. Hashito points out that many possible reasons could be possible. Babimyna observes their exchange and thinks about how Camilla'sHave-Notsused curses unique to them, and wonders if they are Nen abilities, and if they were really targeting Woble. Because Camilla chose to only send one representative, Kurapika guesses that they have a firm resolve, and from Camilla's personality guesses that they had a goal other than learning. He thinks about how Melody's letter to him did not mention Camilla, and wonders if Camilla had a secret that forced her to act.[120] Kurapika tells Bill that they had to keep Camilla's guards away from Woble as much as possible, and tells him that they would go through the tough shifts together. He then tells Shimano[note 2]to stay by the Queen and Prince's sides, and to leave chores until later. He remembers the contract he has with Zhang Lei, and keeps in mind to be careful.[120]"

In this state, even as a child, Kurapika could gain the upper hand in terms of speed and strength against three adults and easily overpowered them. However, Kurapika admitted that when his eyes turn scarlet, he loses all restraint and rationality and becomes primal, which also occurs whenever he sees a spider.[22]Furthermore, overusing his Scarlet Eyes can have severe repercussions on his health, as doing so caused him to become incapacitated and feverish for more than one day without Melody's Nen ability managing to lower his body temperature.[82]His current limit is about 3 hours, after which the pain and fatigue become too intense and he passes out[104]for 3 times as long. Kurapika also speculates that repeated long uses or ones induced by stealing particularly powerful abilities may cause him to reach the limit earlier than 3 hours.[105]At some point during his Nen training, Kurapika learned to turn his eyes scarlet at will and acquired the ability to control his emotions.[121] Advanced Hearing:Kurapika has a keener sense of hearing than average humans, which enables him to perceive revelatory sounds[9]and overhear conversations others would miss.[21] Preternatural Perception:Even prior to learning Nen, he was one of the few candidates of the Hunter Exam to notice being followed by a proctor during the Third Phase. His first meeting withIzunavidemonstrated that he has a developed instinct, as he dodged an acorn imbued with Nen without knowing anything of inner energy, but understanding in a moment it would have been lethal for him to be hit.[122] Enhanced Strength:After training atZebro's house, Kurapika managed to open the first door of theTesting Gate, whose total weight is 4 tons. His strength increases when his eyes turn scarlet.[4]With Nen, his blows become more destructive, to the point he can not only inflict pain to Uvogin despite the latter's body being impervious to bullets, but also inflict damage on him.[61] Kurapika deflecting bullets Immense Speed and Reflexes:Kurapika struck Uvogin various times before he could react and even disappeared out of sight in a space clear of hideouts with a leap.[60]He can catch bullets with one of his chains[47]and restrain a target with another in 0.5 seconds from a fair distance,[123]and in approximately 0.2 or 0.3 from only a few meters.[78] Enhanced Agility:Kurapika can jump several meters in the air and hit his opponents from various angles with acrobatic moves without losing his balance.[60]This is first proven when he leaps on top of a chandelier during the exam to be hired byLight Nostrade[47]and later in the confrontation against Uvogin.[60] Enhanced Endurance:Possibly due to the loathing he harbors toward the Phantom Troupe and the absolute determination to win the fight, Kurapika seemed almost unfazed by Uvogin breaking his arm.[60] Genius-Level Intellect:Kurapika is one of the most brilliant characters in the series. Because of this, he was appointed leader ofNeon's bodyguards after the demise ofDalzollene.[57]He outsmarted minds ofChrollo's level with carefully planned strategies, and his predictions have rarely turned out to be wrong. He also has an immense deal of knowledge about many topics, ranging from psychology to other cultures, from history to forensic, a quality that surprised his brethren when he was only a child. Due to his longing for new notions, he is a fast learner with an impressive memory. Kurapika's analytical skills are so outstanding they have led to the spreading of the rumor, amongMuherr's assassins, that he is able to read minds.[1]When searching for Halkenburg on the Kakin bodyguard registration, he used the vaguest of clues to choose whom he felt to be Halkenburg, something praised by Oito.[93] Master Strategist:Kurapika can formulate flawless plans even in combat to exploit his opponent's weaknesses to the fullest. His intuition is matched by his logical thinking and meticulous preparations. Although he can retain his cool in desperate situations, he can barely stick to his own plan when it concerns the Phantom Troupe, to the extent he might even snap and endanger not only himself, but his friends as well. On the Black Whale he exhibited greater composure than before and has performed his greatest strategic feat yet, becoming the lynchpin of a stalemate, or at least an impediment, of the succession contest with an endless series of ad hoc tactics, mixing truth and lies, secrets and deliberately disclosed information.[114]His disclosure of the existence of Nen and his classes constituted the biggest game-changer of the succession contest, forcing an impasse and increasing the odds of lower-ranked princes to survive.[111][113][114] Proficient Hand-to-Hand Combatant:Kurapika was able to land several punches and kicks on a fighter specialized in unarmed combat such as Uvogin with almost no damage on his part.[60] Master Weapon Specialist:With the full extent of his abilities in the field being unclear, Kurapika used a pair ofbokkenswords linked by a thread before learning Nen, and could wield them also as anunchaku. In the 1999 anime, it was revealed thebokkenswords were actually two sheathed blades. He displayed the ability to use them skillfully against Hisoka. When he worked as Neon's bodyguard, he carried a knife with him, although he used it solely for intimidation. However, the weapon Kurapika specializes in currently are his chains, which he learned to use in battle with great skill in a rather short amount of time. He can move them with such mastery that they act as natural extensions of his limbs, being even able to entangle targets at a distance of almost 30 meters in less than a second.[60]The chains are suited for both offensive and defensive purposes ,[47]as well as immobilizing the opponent .[55] Bilingual:Kurapika's mother tongue is the language spoken by the Kurta, but he has also acquired perfect proficiency in the language used inthe worldat large.[5] NVCExpert:Even without the usage of his chain, Kurapika is adept at recognizing lies by looking at his interlocutor's eyes. He demonstrated it when inquiring about Melody's motivation for becoming a bodyguard: he not only understood her answer was sincere, but also that she was hiding important details.[51]When trying to identify a mole within the Zodiacs, he could tell it was Saiyu just by observing his body language.[92]"
What is the weapon that Kurapika conjures?,his chain,Nen,"Kurapika conjures his chain Kurapika is aConjurer, a Nen user that can create objects out of thin air according to his imagination, but he becomes aSpecialistwhen his eyes turn scarlet.[4]He learned Nen in a very short time and is deemed a very skilled user. In terms of theoretical knowledge, he can divide Nen apprenticesby aptitude,[107]and is an expert in the mechanics ofLimitationsandManipulationNen.[108]Kurapika has Nen abilities that incorporate elements ofEmission, Manipulation,[121]andEnhancement;[4]in addition, he has exhibited proficiency inTransmutation,[108]proving himself a well-rounded Nen user and one of the very few who can access all six Nen categories. The weapon that he conjures is a unique one—five chains that extend from each finger on his right hand. Some of the fingers were specially designed to deal vengeance on the Phantom Troupe.[55]To increase the effectiveness of his chains against them, Kurapika placed strict Limitations on the usage of his chains.[4]Since the chains are materialized, their size and length can be controlled to a certain degree.[55]He is able to conceal his chain throughInin order to bind his opponent without their knowledge until it is too late. Kurapika is also proficient in other branches on Nen, such asShu,[60]which, combined withEmperor Time, gives his chains the ability to shatter rock, andGyo.[60]He has reached a level of skill high enough that he can remain in a state ofTenwithout conscious thought.[106] Kurapika's different chains By using a Limitation that puts his own life at stake, his abilities received a great boost.[55][4]In fact, one of his chains is so strong that Uvogin, an experienced fighter, assumed that it was a real chain that Kurapika was manipulating.[61]The combination of his Limitation, the increase in skill granted by his Specialization ability, and the aura boost granted by his Scarlet Eyes allowed him to reduce the gap in strength against a master Enhancer such as Uvogin.[60]Repeated usage of his Scarlet Eyes combined with Nen takes a heavy toll on his mind and body,[61]causing him an incapacitating high fever that, after the death of Pakunoda, lasted several days and could not be relieved by Melody's flute.[82] A side-effect ofStealth Dolphinis that when it is used on a non-user it will allow them to see aura[101]and, after the loaned ability is activated, semi-force all of their Aura Nodes open, essentially making them Nen users, although training is still necessary to control one's own aura flow and prevent its leakage.[114]"
What does Hisoka do when he meets new people?,he goes out of his way to find new toys to play with,Personality,"The other side of Hisoka Hisoka is portrayed as entirely self-serving and self-absorbed; he does whatever he likes as long as it pleases him in some way. His insatiable love for spilling the blood of powerful fighters in combat and his enjoyment of extreme pain while doing so fuels his seemingly sadomasochistic desires. In order for them to grow to their full potential , Hisoka allows the main protagonists to live in situations wherein he is easily able to kill them. Likewise, he grows excited to meet new people he deems worthy of fighting or anyone with the potential to be a good fighter and entertain him in the future. The thrill of fighting strong Nen users in tactical battles and near-death experiences is an orgasmic experience for him. It is likely one of the reasons why he goes out of his way to find new toys to play with. If they break, he either loses interest or kills them before going out to find more potential prey. With his manipulative and self-centered nature, Hisoka is essentially a murderous sociopath. While he does like Gon,Killua, and many others, he has stated that for him, what is valuable one day could easily become trash the next, and he will not hesitate to kill anyone should they not meet his standards. He does not care for what has happened in the past, as he is only interested in what could be amusing to him in the future or present. While Hisoka's nature tends to be malevolent, he isn't an indiscriminate killer. He has no problems killing anyone regardless of age or sex; however, he only kills people who are in his way or those he deems ""worthy"". As such, his character is more simply amoral than flat out evil. He even assists the protagonists if there is ""fun"" in doing so or if it will make them stronger leading to a more entertaining fight in the future. Above all else, Hisoka cares only about having fun and a good challenge which may or may not involve killing people. He has a nasty habit of skipping out on Spider meetings. He also can be a whimsical liar and has a tendency to freak out or play cruel jokes on his victims. Just witnessing their uncomfortable expressions because of him getting under their skin pleases him. His chaotic nature is inherent in everything he does and makes him dangerously unpredictable. Hisoka becomes immensely excited to fight Hisoka has displayed a morbid attraction to fight powerful fighters, or people with Nen who have the potential to become strong, which is expressed through barely repressible murderous tendencies; neither age nor gender do seem to influence his desire to fight them. He has expressed a desire to fight or kill random victims just to satiate his bloodlust. After his defeat at the hands ofChrollo, Hisoka's sociopathic nature has taken itself to worse heights by vowing to kill all the members of thePhantom Troupeeven if they were defenseless and claiming he will no longer let his opponents fight in their preferred conditions. However, he did temporarily spareMachi, who has been an implied interest of Hisoka's as a potential opponent he likes to flirt with or as a romantic interest, although he stated it was so she could warn the Troupe of his intentions. Hisoka often exhibits androgynous characteristics throughout the series, manifested in his wearing of ""women's"" shoes and using an alluring speech style typically reserved for females in Japanese. In the manga, he ends nearly every sentence with a suit symbol. Hisoka and Killua's reaction to Gon's honesty Despite his calm and composed personality, he can express his emotion comically in some situations. An example is when Gon becomes honest and rather innocent about his question of why Hisoka was in Greed Island. Another example is his stunned face when he learns he could not fight Chrollo afterKurapika'sJudgment Chain."
What is the name of the spell card shop in Masadora?,Hisoka's Spell Card Shop,Greed island arc,"Hisoka appearing before the Phantom Troupe Hisoka heads toGreed Islandin search of anExorcistfor Chrollo.

Theyfly to himas he bathes in a lake. Sensing the two boys have improved, he determines Biscuit to be their teacher. He tells them he came to the island to find Chrollo, as he fears they would try to stop him if he revealed he is looking for an Exorcist. At Biscuit's request, he accepts to play against Razor's group.[60] Hisoka tells Gon his goal in Greed Island Hisoka pretends not to know what spells are and takes the group to the nearbyAiai, where he spends his free time, to find other players. However, the romantic clichés prove to be too distracting. Killua begins to suspect that Hisoka has met other members of the Phantom Troupe on the island and is hiding it from everyone. When Gon asks him to check his contacts to know if he has metTsezguerra, Hisoka conceals the names of the Spiders withTexture Surprise. HecontactstheSingle-StarHunter for the group.[57]They form an alliance and Hisoka volunteers to playsoccer jugglingon account of hisBungee Gum. After one week, they head toSoufrabi.[59]The group wins three games, after which Razor challenges the remaining players to a dodgeball match. When Razor kills a rebelliousBopobo, Hisoka reveals to his team the game is taking place in real life.[61]Shortly after the start of the game, Gon gives Hisoka the ball, so he can throw it and retrieve it withBungee Gum.[62]He eliminates one of Razor's Devils, but Razor combines two of them to prevent him from getting the ball back.[63]He narrowly escapes a shoot ball thrown by Razor, which is then intercepted by one of his Demons.

They succeed and Gon shoots the ball with his last, most powerfulRock.[67]Razor bumps it back at him, but Gon passes out from exhaustion, so the ball misses him. Hisoka catches and throws it back withBungee Gum, sticking it to Razor's hands so he cannot deflect it again, at the cost of 10 broken fingers. Razor is pushed out of bounds, resulting in the team's victory.[68]Hisoka leaves them, and his parting words cause Killua to realize he was indeed lying.[69] Hisoka leaving Greed Island with Abengane Phinks takes Hisoka to where the other Spiders are after they locate the Exorcist. He inquires how the Troupe managed to find him, and when they refuse to answer, he wonders if it could be the work of the person hiding behind a tree nearby and threatens to vent his arousal against them if they do not come out.Kalluto, Hisoka's replacement in the Troupe, walks out, and Hisoka expresses his approval of him. He then asks Machi, between him and Chrollo, who she'd prefer survive and what she would do if he killed Chrollo, to which Machi replies she would hunt him down and kill him. He smiles and states he would like that.[70]A few weeks later, he leaves the island withAbenganeafter the latter has successfully deactivatedGenthru'sCountdown.[71]"
Who does Illumi ask to help him kill Alluka?,Gon,13thhunter chairman election arc,"Hisoka votes Hisoka is next seen during the first round of the 13thHunter Chairman Electionlooking forGing. He secretly rates the Hunters on the scene using a scale of his own and is apparently quite happy with the power of some members of theZodiacs:Kanzai,Ginta, andPyon. He then casts a blank vote after showing it to them, which annoys Kanzai. After that, he sits there scouting out the crowd. While sizing up the pro-Hunters present at the election site, Hisoka is disappointed by their power levels and thinks to himself that if they are this weak, he might consider fighting the Zodiacs next. Suddenly he feels the presence of someone strong, who turns out to beIllumi. Illumi then tells Hisoka about what happened during the Chimera Ant crisis, the death of Chairman Netero,Alluka—his younger sister, and the current situation with Gon and Killua.[73] Hisoka provokes Illumi Hisoka and Illumi are next seen talking to each other in an airship bar. Illumi explains the rules related to Alluka's ability to him and tells him if Killua dies from Alluka's power while trying to heal Gon, a lot of people, including the Zoldycks, Gon, and even Hisoka, will die as well. Fearing that Killua will do it wrong, Illumi asks Hisoka to help him kill Alluka.[74]Later, as Killua, Alluka, and their butlers are on their way to Gon's hospital, Illumi manipulates some drivers and crashes their vehicles into Killua's car, causing it to fall into a forest below. Watching from a distance, Illumi tells Hisoka to eliminate the butlers but Hisoka asks if he can kill Killua. Illumi suddenly releases a murderous aura and warns him. Hisoka says he is just kidding. It is then revealed that he provoked Illumi on purpose to let Killua know his location because he too wants Gon to be saved.[75] Hisoka kills Gotoh He then confrontsGotoh,Amane, andCanary, who are left behind after Killua uses hisGodspeedability to escape with Alluka. Gotoh tells the other butlers to go ahead and let him deal with Hisoka. At first, hisBungee Gumability seems to be neutralized by Gotoh's ability to fire coins with power superior to bullets, but Hisoka manages to adapt quickly and uses hisBungee Gumto fire the coins back, forcing him to shoot more coins to deflect them, with that distraction Hisoka is able to drop in on him and slit his throat.[76] Hisoka and Illumi arrive atParasta Airport, where Killua uses an airship as transportation to escape them. Hisoka suggests that they should ambush Killua in the hospital, but Illumi claims the assassination will fail if they do so because Killua's friends are there. Illumi thinks of asking for help, prompting Hisoka to ask if he has any other acquaintances. Illumi instead reveals an ability tomanipulate a person's actions through a Nen-imbued needle. Illumi asks Hisoka if he can hunt the ""misses"" for him, and Hisoka gladly accepts.[77] Hisoka and Illumi talk over the phone after killing their attackers. Hisoka informs Illumi that he has found a map detailing the aircraft's paths and destinations. He offers to send Illumi a copy, albeit one that is altered by hisTexture Surprise. Unfortunately, Illumi says that he also has a map from one of the attackers and that he already knows which aircraft Killua and Alluka are.[78] Hisoka kills the Hunters Although he is shown to be Illumi's comrade his bloodlust seems to get the better of him, this is shown when Illumi finds Killua, Hisoka is seen hiding in the trees trying to decide who to kill if to kill Alluka and gain Killua's hatred or leave Alluka alive save Gon and make Illumi his enemy. He then questions himself by thinking that maybe he should kill Alluka which would make Killua hate him, or kill Killua and have Illumi hate him is the best plan of action. Hisoka is next seen exiting an elevator and going into the room whereTeradein Neutralis staying, Hisoka then kills him.[79]"
What is the name of Hisoka's normal aura?,Transmuter[6],Nen,"Hisoka's normal aura Hisoka is aTransmuter[6]endowed with a powerful, sinister aura that disquietedWing[37]and Gon even after the latter learned Nen.[38]He manifests his high level of proficiency in his natural category primarily through hisNen ability,Bungee Gum, but he has also shown to be very proficient at controlling the shape of his aura,[31]which is a Transmutation skill.[99]This aptitude may be what allows him to extend strands of elastic aura over distances of several meters without flinging them, which makes its application more subtle.[7][38][81]He is also well-versed inConjuration, the Nen type of his second ability, as well asEmissionand, seemingly,Enhancement. He utilizes the former to maintain aura around projectiles[31]as well as in conjunction withBungee Gum, to separate the ability from his body.[38][85] Hisoka's sinister aura His affinity for Enhancement manifests primarily as a remarkable level of durability. Hisoka survived multiple Nen-enhanced strikes from Kastro, an Enhancer, without using his aura to defend.[33]Although he was briefly stunned,[81]Hisoka took no visible damage from most of Chrollo's attacks,[2][80][81]one of which can allegedly behead a person with a knife-hand strike,[44]despite Hisoka having been unable to predict them and thus to guard properly. He seems to have resorted toManipulationon one occasion, exploiting the boost enjoyed byNen after deathto impart an automatic command to hisBungee Gum.[85] Hisoka extends his elastic aura Aside fromHatsu, Hisoka is capable of using at leastRen,[30]Gyo,[34]andKen, which allowed him to survive multiple explosions ofThe Sun and Moonset off in his proximity, although one of his legs was severely mangled.[84]Like many other high-level Nen users, he can maintain a state ofTenat all times.[8]It is also likely that he is proficient atZetsu[30][55][78][79]andKo.[64]The two techniques he employs with the greatest frequency areShuand especiallyIn. With Shu his poker cards can easily cut through bone[13]and concrete[38]even while he is not holding them. When he applied it to a severed human head, it carried so much force that it pulverized other heads it came in contact with,[83]incapacitated several puppets with a single throw and injured a Nen user of Chrollo Lucilfer's caliber[82]without being damaged in the least, whereas it would break immediately if not enveloped in aura.[83]If Hisoka favors Shu for direct attacks, In is at the core of his strategies, as he combines the technique withBungee Gumto lay elaborate, deadly traps.[7][38][76][81] Hisoka's prosthetic foot Hisoka's Nen prowess if further supported by his knowledge of more abstract notions, such as Nen becoming stronger after death[80]andExorcism.[60]He also came up with the concept of ""Memory Overload""[34]and a system to divine an individual's Nen type from their personality, which, despite him calling it unreliable, has proven correct several times.[6][60]"

What does Natsu use to create a propulsive effect?

The heat of his fire can increase in temperature, which is proportional to Natsu's emotional state. Natsu subconsciously used this against Erigor; his flame's heat significantly rose as he got more enraged, referred to asFlame of Emotion.[64]Natsu’s natural body heat also makes him resistant to the cold, even within a snowy blizzard.[65]He incorporates the flames he ignites into his melee fighting style, greatly increasing the damage of his blows.[66]As such, Natsu's Magic revolves around the usage of fire that can spout from any part of his body.[67][68] Natsu's ability to eat any kind of fire gives him immunity to most types of flames, including explosions, even byCurseusers[69]and allows him to spew fire from his lungs.[70]This fire is exceptionally strong - equivalent to a Dragon's fire - being able to burn even through metal.[71]The flames he makes cannot be extinguished by normal water.[72]He can even use his flames to create a propulsive effect.[73]The type of fire he uses can be changed, as it can be solidified to cling to surfaces like an appendage and control its shape,[74]this applies to any external flames, as any fire Natsu touches is also turn solid if he wishes.[75] By the year X792, after one year of training, Natsu has shown improved mastery over his Dragon Slayer Magic as he is now capable of taking out multiple opponents with just one attack, as shown when he challenged and effortlessly defeated the team of the newly announced No.1 guild in Fiore,Scarmiglioneall while melting the arena with his heat,[76]manipulate the trajectory of his ranged attacks[77]and later was able to defeatBluenote Stingerin one attack while burning hisBlack Holespell after using his fire to raise the ground against his increased gravity.[78]Natsu’s body heat now makes him impervious to most sharp attacks such as spikes[79]and bladed weapons as they’ll just melt instantly upon contact.[80][81]Aldoronnoted that remnants of the fires Natsu has utilised such as those of Igneel, Atlas Flame, and Ignia have all mixed within his own.[82] Fire Dragon's Roar Dragon God´s Brilliant Flame Crimson Lotus: Exploding Flame Blade Hell Flame Dragon Slayer Magic: After consuming the fire ofAtlas Flame,[105]Natsu became capable of integrating it into his attacks, parti.[106][107] Lightning Fire Dragon Mode Lightning Fire Dragon Mode: After eatingLaxus Dreyar'slightningand having the flames and lightning inside his body fuse together, Natsu gained the ability to use his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic enhanced with lightning.[108]When in a state of anger, Natsu is able to summon forth this power, however, it leaves him heavily exhausted afterward.[109]After unlocking hisSecond Origin, Natsu experiences a noticeably less amount of strain, thus can now use this mode at will.[110] Natsu’s Black Fire Dragon Mode Black Fire Dragon Mode: After absorbing the flames ofDark Regulus, Natsu is capable of combining these flames with his own for more destructive effects.[121]However, consumption of the flames of Dark Regulus rendered Natsu temporarily with a fever due to the Dark Magic within the black flames clashing with his Dragon Slayer Magic. Expelling most of the Dark Magic from his body allowed him to recover[122]and became able to use the Dragon Mode at will with no more side effects.[123] Natsu using Igneel's power to unleash Fire Dragon King's Mode Fire Dragon King Mode: After ten months of training to store and manipulate Igneel's remaining power bequeathed to him, Natsu is capable of using the power of the Fire Dragon King.[124]According to Natsu himself, this mode was believed to be strong enough for him to defeat Zeref, however, its full potential depended on the remnants of Igneel's power which, upon activation, could not be recovered and used again.[125]Even with the absence of Igneel's power, Natsu can still utilize this mode using his own power as a substitute, though it is nowhere near as powerful as before. Any nearby bodies of water such as an entire lake gets instantly evaporated upon Natsu entering this mode.[126]This mode can be further strengthened by Natsu’s Flames of Emotions, making it strong enough to overpower Zeref's Fairy Heart-Induced Form by burning his spells and his power over time he obtained from theSpace Between Time. The intensity of the flames at the time increased so far pass Natsu’s limit that it burned his own soul and even his own arm, a feat no other type fire could inflict onto him,[127][128]the close exception being after consuming Ignia’s flames where both his arms got burned.[129] Lightning Dragon Mode Lightning Dragon Mode: After temporarily losing his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic, Natsu was able to utilize thelightningfrom hisLightning Fire Dragon Mode, incorporating lightning onto his body and performing lightning variations of his original Dragon Slayer spells. While in this mode, he also gains a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his right eye similar to Laxus’.[136] Natsu’s Dragon Force Dragon Force: By consumingEtherionor theFlame of RebukeNatsu has been shown to be able to enter Dragon Force. This ability is said to be the final and most powerful state a Dragon Slayer can attain, and it has been said that their power becomes comparable to that of a real Dragon's.[139]Natsu is the first known First generation Dragon Slayer to enter Dragon Force without consuming external sources. Natsu becomes more Dragon-like from each use, slowly forming red scales throughout his body. After consuming the Flame of Rebuke, Natsu’s fire while in Dragon Force has retained a golden color ever since.[140]The exception being when Natsu attained Dragon Force through the flames of the Fire Dragon God, the flames take on a darker aura, Natsu's appearance is altered to feature similar claws he possessed when using his E.N.D. Power.[141]The spells in this form are augmented greatly, especially when combined with other forms such as Fire Dragon King Mode,[142]this also makes Natsu capable of overpowering a Water Dragon, despite being his opposite affinity.[133]His Dragon Force is also strong enough to be able to burn off Magic itself, including Zeref'sAnkhseram Black Magicthat was being used to restrain him.[143]While this is active, Natsu is able to attack God Seed Aldoron with his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic that is strong enough to be mistaken for an actual Dragon's flames.[144] Dragonization: A side effect of Dragon Slayer Magic that causes Natsu to mutate and morph into a Fire Dragon. However, due to antibodies given to him by Igneel, Natsu will never fully turn into a Dragon or inherent it’s negative side effects.[149]As such, Natsu is only capable of partial transformations, usually forming Dragon scales while in Dragon Force, this state increases Natsu’s feats depending on the extent of the transformation.[140] Unison Raid: An ability which allows two Mages to unite their Magic into a single, combined, stronger attack.

By burning away the herbs he was able to easily track their location to Tartaros’ HQ which was supposed to be impossible to find.[155][156]His sense of smell is able to detect those who are related to each other, noticing that Silver had a similar scent to his son Gray.[157] Enhanced Hearing: Natsu, according to himself, possesses exceptionally good hearing, something which, during theGrand Magic Games, was proven true. DuringLucy Heartfilia'sfightwithFlare Corona, the latter was threateningAsuka Connellwith the help of herhair. Natsu was seemingly the only one who could hear their low conversation, and thus reacted accordingly by protecting the girl from the threat, allowing Lucy to continue fighting.[158]Natsu also heard Cobra arriving in the outskirts of the city even while high in the air.[159]In X792, Natsu’s hearing has increased tremendously that he could hear someone being robbed far away from the town he was present in and accurately strike each thief with his fire breath.[85]He has also proven himself to be able to hear the voices of the Alvarez soldiers searching for a spy from way out at sea.[160] Enhanced Sight: Natsu's possesses great eyesight, having been capable of seeing Yukino from afar before his companions can notice where she is.[161]Natsu’s eyesight also gives a great sense of firing accuracy, capable of striking several flying targets from a distance as they attempt to fly away.[162] Natsu displaying his physical strength against Sting and Rogue Immense Strength: Natsu has shown on numerous occasions to possess a high degree of strength, enough for him to perform a number of physical feats, among which are freely swinging around the mast of a ship as a makeshift weapon,[163]doing the same with a palm tree he personally broke, bare-handed,[164]shattering a billiard table and cracking most of its balls simply by hitting one of them with the cue,[165]and stopping the gargantuanDorma Anim's foot, which was going to crush him and his fellow Dragon Slayers, all by himself, subsequently throwing the robotic Dragon off balance by rapidly pushing it away.[166]Furthermore, he was capable of battling bothSting EucliffeandRogue Cheney, alone, while they were inDragon Force, easily over-powering the two with his sheer physical strength.[167]Furthermore, Natsu is able to lift a very large boulder, given the fact that he was already injured from Franmalth's Curse, and used it in order to defeat the Demon.[168]After a year of training, Natsu has also demonstrated the ability to move under the influence of Bluenote Stinger's gravitational field, something eight years before which he was not able to do, though Natsu was in a suspended state for seven of those years while Bluenote was not.[169]Natsu was able to break through several of Alok's barriers with with sheer force alone, something thought to be impossible.[170]Natsu has also shown to crush a shard ofStellaniumwith his bare hand, a crystal mineral said to be harder than diamond.[171] Immense Reflexes: Natsu possesses fast reflexes, having been capable of dodging attacks from Erza, Laxus and, most recently, attacks from Sting, quickly evading his lazer beam of light just in time even upon first seeing it.[172] Immense Speed: Natsu's natural speed is impressive, enough for him to close great distances in a blink of an eye and dodge swift attacks.[173] Natsu effortlessly defends against Sting's Holy Nova Immense Durability: Natsu has proven himself to be incredibly durable. He has managed to take continual, deadly assaults from foes and continue fighting. Such impressive resistance was first shown during his battle withErigor, in which he received wounds from his opponent's strong, sharp wind, and kept fighting on, nonetheless.[174]During his time in Edolas, Natsu fights Faust'smechanical Dragon, where he took powerful hits and continued to fight.[175]A true testament to his durability was shown when he blocked one of Sting Eucliffe's strongest attacks,Holy Nova, with a single hand, and emerged completely unscathed from the enormous explosion that followed the impact.[176]Soon after he took on a powerful breath attack from Sting using Dragon Force that destroyed the arena around Natsu.[177] Immense Endurance: Natsu has shown to possess an incredible amount of physical endurance as he is able to survive and keep on fighting the God Seed Aldoron after being impaled by a large number of wooden thorns all over his body.[178] Immense Magic Power: By the year X792 after one year of training, Natsu's Magic Power has increased to the point where it was unrecognizable to Lucy, but great enough that it prompted her to evacuate everyone out of theDomus Flaudespite the presence of many powerful Mages. Natsu can exert his Magic Power in the form of an enormous scalding aura that can generate heat of such magnitude that it is capable of melting the entirety of the stone coliseum, as well as burn off the clothes of any nearby individuals. This displays some level of control of his aura, however, as nobody was actually harmed by the heat, and his and Happy's clothes remained untouched.[179] Curse Power: Referred to his asE.N.D. Power, [180]Natsu as an Etherious is able to access his dormant demonic power that stems from a tumor-like mass within his chest which caused physical pain. This power was subsided when shrunken by Brandish'sCommand Twho later enlarged it back to its original size. Like all Etherious, his desire to kill his creator; Zeref is activated, however he still retains his ability to think and function properly to his will. When Natsu uses his E.N.D. Power to take on hisEtherious Form his arms and facial features become more demonic with dark clawed hands, while his attack power increases. He has been seen to control it at will when he deactivated it after Erza stopped his battle with Gray.[181][182]This demonic power was described to be strong enough to surpass the Gods due to Natsu being able to use it in order to move freely on his own while inside atime-distorted worldmade by Dimaria which was taught to her by theGod of Timehimself.[183]The Curse Power can also be used in conjunction with Natsu's fire, altering it and/or augmenting it while having a dark aura mixed with it the flames.[184] Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Natsu is an extremely proficient unarmed fighter, often using his Dragon Slayer Magic in combination with punches, kicks, and even headbutts, to combat his opponents to great effect.[66]Such skill is paired with amazing physical prowess: aside from his strength, Natsu has displayed high degrees of speed, agility and reflexes, enough for him to match melee-specialists of Erza's caliber in battle. After 1 year training, Natsu was able to defeat 3 members ofAvatar- the successor of formerDark Guilds- in quick succession despite their own prowess.[188]"

During this time a draconian tattoo appeared on his arm that served as the physical manifestation of the aforementioned Magic Power. The Magic Power bestowed to Natsu is said to be the manifestation of Igneel's undying will, however, it is extremely finite, and once it runs out, the user can never utilize its power again.[195] Natsu with the Seven Fire Dragon's Power Seven Flame Dragon's Power: During his fight with Acnologia within theSpace Between Time, Wendy used her Enchantment to temporarily empower Natsu with the combined Magic Power of six Dragon Slayers composed of Laxus, Gajeel, Sting, Rogue, Erik and Wendy herself.[196]The combined Magic Power takes on the appearance of a rainbow colored energy[197]that surrounds Natsu's right arm and greatly increases the offensive power of hisFire Dragon's Iron Fistto the point of manifesting it in the form of a huge flaming fist and destructive enough to finally defeat Acnologia himself.[198]"

She has eventually inherited Natsu's stubbornness and refusal to give up, even when the odds are against her.[14] Lucy usually freaks out at her guildmate's antics.

So far, Lucy has obtained 10 Gold Keys and 5 Silver Keys, a considerable amount of Keys for a single Celestial Spirit Mage.

To activate the Magic, the casters must kneel on the ground and hold hands, while one has to recite the incantation. Whilst chanting, an aura will encase the casters, which will surge upwards, and stars will slowly fill up the heavens; as the caster yells out the spell's name, the aura will become a beam, together with the stars shining brighter, swirling around the target. However, the spell will inflict pain to the users. The spell was powerful enough to shatter the Celestial Globe to pieces. Initially, Lucy cast the spell by joining her Magic with Yukino andHisui E.

In addition, while never relying on punches, likely due to her limited physical strength, Lucy possesses some kicking prowess, as seen during the Phantom Lord arc, she was able to send Reedus flying with a simple kick despite him being much larger than she is.[108][109]After one year time skip, Lucy employs some armed and unarmed combat in conjunction with some of her Star Dress forms to have more advantage in battle.[47] Lucy Kick"

What is Asta's attitude towards his lack of magic?,boisterous,Personality,"Asta's explosive nature Asta is happy, hyperactive, optimistic, carefree, determined, and sometimes, naive to the point of stupidity.[22]He tends to shout to express his thoughts and goals, much to the annoyance of some of those around him, and often in spite of other people's opinions. One of the first examples of this is when he conveyed his goal of becoming aWizard Kingduring the Magic Knights entrance exam, and told other people who jeered at him to be quiet.[23]Asta's simple yet outgoing personality is frequently played to comedic effect during more serious situations. However, his strong tenacity interestsYami Sukehiroenough to recruit him into his ranks,[24]and his determination also leads him to possess an indomitable will. Asta's determination to never give up, added with his own steel fortitude during grueling or harsh battles, is a trait that becomes the basis for others to acknowledge him, such asMagna Swing.[25]However, Asta has shown to have struggled accepting his lack of magic, using his boisterous attitude as a front to hide his insecurity. After having his arms broken and cursed byVetto, Asta nearly slips into a depression before talking and forcing himself to continue pushing onward. Because of his upbringing in the Forsaken region, Asta frequently receives cruel opinions and insults from almost everyone he meets. To counteract this, Asta appears to have developed a slightly sarcastic nature as he tries to defend himself.[26][27]The regularity at which he's exposed to such degrading remarks is such that he now has a certain immunity to them, shown when he easily brushes them off without getting overly annoyed.[28]However, Asta can still become irritated when others deeply insult his comrades; he will not hesitate to confront them as he tries to defend his friends.[29] Asta accepts Noelle as his comrade. Asta also has a very strong sense of justice, which is shown during his fight againstHeath Graice, as he believes that everyone deserves to be protected.[30]It is also not limited to only his comrades but his enemies as well, as noted when he asks his fellow squadmates to take the unconsciousMarsalong with them while the dungeon is collapsing. He argues that their mission is only to explore a dungeon as they are not ordered to kill any enemies.[31]Therefore, Asta seems to see the positive side of everyone and never takes an insult too seriously, as seen when he still befriends bothYunoandNoelle Silvaeven after both had openly looked down on him.[32][33]Even whenFanais trying to kill him and his allies with all her power, he attempts to reason with her as a means to understand and talk her down from her rage. This shows that Asta is a pacifist, and prefers a peaceful approach to problem solving and confrontations. He later continues to do this with the reincarnated elves, despite no success among repeated attempts. However, Asta also believes that those that have done wrong should work to actively make up for their wrongdoings. He always holds his enemies accountable for their misdeeds, regardless if he has forgiven them or not. He requests thatNeigespend time in prison before promising to become his friend. He later demands that the weakenedLadrosapologize to and help all the people he has harmed. In another example, he putsRadesinto a submission hold during their next meeting, nearly breaking his arm until the latter successfully convinces him that he will use his powers to help the people in the capital rather than for revenge. His open, friendly, and non-judgmental attitude, indomitable will, and stubbornness has earned him the respect of almost everyone he meets, even nobles such as Klaus andFuegoleon Vermillion. It has also earned him the affection of numerous girls, though his love for Sister Lily, combined with his somewhat dense personality, has made him largely oblivious of this fact. This love for Lily and obliviousness also make him somewhat chivalrous and non-perverted, as he absolutely refused to try to peek on the girls while bathing at the hot spring. While an immensely endearing and honest person, who can win over people with his tenacity, Asta can come off as quite stupid to those around him. Asta is not exactly stupid but growing up in an orphanage in the middle of nowhere has left him ignorant of many things that others consider common knowledge and his headstrong nature makes him come across as the stereotypical muscle head with little to no brains. His naivete constantly leads him to blurt out things with little to no tact or care for the situation at hand, and his blind trust of people in the kingdom despite evidence to the contrary has made him very easy to fool, depending on the situation. His trusting, truthful nature has been taken advantage of by the courts and he nearly spoke his guilt without thinking of the consequences while he was on trial. He is also very ignorant about many things in the kingdom and on its functions which Magic Knights should know with most of his squadmates is that he does not know many simple things such as how corrupt the system ruled by the nobles really is which almost cost him and Marie their lives. Asta is also the simple and direct type, as he prefers simple and direct explanations as he can become confused with too much information. For example, when the Witch Queen explained to the Black Bulls about the history of elves and the function of magic stones, Asta did not understand the explanation at all, and struggled to be able to follow along and understand, only for his brain to overheat from the amount of information. Although Asta appears to have unshakable confidence and willpower, he was plagued by doubts about his own strength. It is revealed that Asta unknowingly had an inferiority complex compared to those born with great talent as mages, like Yuno, making him doubt himself and his own abilities. This affected his performance in combat, as his doubts, uncertainties and insecurities made him hesitate to attack, giving his enemies an opening to take advantage and defeat him. Asta, however, was able to overcome his inferiority complex, accepting his lack of talent, and understanding that it did not make him inferior to those who had it, making him gain the necessary disposition to be the Wizard King he always dreamed of; be determined to be the strongest."

What kind of demeanor does Yuno have?,calm and emotionless,Personality,"Yuno has a calm and emotionless demeanor and speaks only when he really needs to convey his thoughts. His manner of speaking often makes people misinterpret what he means.[20][21]Despite his detached nature, Yuno harbors a strong ambition to be theWizard King, which he developed while growing up withAsta.[22]Additionally, Yuno has a sense of rivalry with him so strong that he will go to any length to stop anyone who tries to put Asta in harm's way.[23]He also goes out of his way to make Asta look good in the eyes of others, even to the point of Asta's expense, such as when he attacked Asta with his most powerful magic, knowing Asta would block it. Yuno is also known to be very blunt and not hold back what he thinks. While cold and distant towards his Golden Dawn members at first, he has grown more friendly and sociable, and he has since established great friendships with mages such as Mimosa and Klaus. Because he spent most of his childhood living with Asta, Yuno possesses similar traits as he does. One is his tenacity and will to never give up, both of which he learned from training together with Asta in their early days.[24]Also like Asta, Yuno has proven himself to be both very stubborn and passionate when he it comes to his goals, and is not afraid to stand his ground against anyone who stands against him. Unlike Asta however, Yuno is not so quick to lose his calm composure in battle, which sometimes leads to him showing a more quiet, yet intense nature of himself. In contrast with his current personality, Yuno used to be more of a crybaby who could not stand up for himself. He started to change after Asta saved him while showing his dream and determination.[25][26]Also in contrast with his personality, Yuno has been shown to be surprisingly protective of the people he views as allies, friends and comrades. This protectiveness however has been misinterpreted by some as arrogance. Yuno has also shown himself to be very considerate and conventional at times like when he protectedCharmy Pappitsonfrom danger, then afterwards accepted her snack out of both nourishment and kindness. Yuno's kindness and sense of justice is further shown when he became enraged upon seeing his guild members being decimated by Zenon Zogratis, and was willing to fight for the sake of his comrades no matter what. According toRalph Niaflem, Yuno hasLoyce's strong heart."
Who is Yuno's foster brother?,Asta,Asta,"Astais Yuno's foster brother, best friend and rival who grew up together inHage. Both of them are aiming for the title ofWizard Kingand competing to get the title first. Yuno and Asta have a mutual respect and acknowledgement for one another, and can usually be seen standing together during their infrequent meetings. It is their rivalry that acts as their motivation to improve themselves. In spite of their long-term competition and the differences in their personalities and abilities, they do not antagonize each other. While Yuno acts mostly cold and distant to his squadmates within theGolden Dawn, he reveals a more lighthearted side towards Asta. Despite his own extraordinary innate talents and gifts, Yuno never underestimates Asta and recognizes his potential and power, even where Asta himself does not and sometimes acts to make Asta look good in front of others. Acting as an older brother figure, Yuno sheds his aloof attitude whenever Asta proves his strength, showing what can be seen as genuine warmth and pride. The two are comfortable fighting alongside each other, and become a powerful force in combat when they work together. While he trusts in Asta's strength, he is also protective of him, such as feeling responsible and helpless when Asta is injured during their fight with Mars in the dungeon. In many ways, Asta and his rivalry with Yuno is a source of strength that Yuno relies and draws on to better himself. While Asta considers Yuno to always be of step ahead of him, Yuno admits that it always felt like the opposite. After learning of Asta's loss againstLucius Zogratisand his presumed death, Yuno was devastated and vowed to defeat Lucius in Asta's place, and achieve their dream of becoming Wizard King."
How long did Yuno work his way up in the ranks of his squad?,continuously,Golden dawn,"When first joining theGolden Dawn, Yuno was immediately looked down upon for being a commoner with many members stating that him having a four-leaf clover grimoire being a mistake or simply luck. Despite not being viewed as a worthy member, Yuno carried out his duties anyway, unbothered by the views of his fellow members. In doing so, Yuno continuously worked his way up in the ranks of his squad, eventually becoming vice-captain. Despite their initial views, various members have come to recognize and respect Yuno, and in turn Yuno has become very protective in his role as vice-captain and also came to view them as his family. Yuno was distraught upon seeing his squad-mates being brutally attacked and killed during the attack on their base by theSpade Kingdom. When Yuno realizes that half the Golden dawn are wiped out byZenon Zogratis, he angrily cries out in frustration over his inability to stop Zenon and protect his fellow members. As the Captain of the Golden Dawn,William Vangeancewas the first in the squad to recognize Yuno's potential. He was very accepting of Yuno and showed a lot of interest in his progress. Yuno in turn, greatly respected William as his captain, yet was very open about his desire to surpass him and become theWizard King. After realizing the leader of theEye of the Midnight Sunwas in fact William possessed by anelf, Yuno voiced his concern toNozel Silvaabout killing him, stating that he wantedAstato free his captain along with the rest of the possessedMagic Knightsand that killing him was unnecessary. Months after the battle with the elves ended, it was William that retrieved and returned themagic stonenecklace to Yuno, which Yuno was very appreciative of. When William was defeated by Zenon, Yuno was quick to attack Zenon in retaliation, showing that as his new vice-captain, Yuno's respect and concern for William has grown. During the captain's meeting, Yuno recalls how William was captured by Zenon because he was fighting while protecting his fellow Golden Dawn member. Yuno states that even though he was suspicious of William after the elf incident, he noticed William's efforts to atone for his mistakes and resolves himself to rescue his captain to prove that William made the right decision by choosing to protect the Golden Dawn members rather than devote his full attention to the battle with Zenon. A senior member of the Golden Dawn and a noble,Klaus Lunetteshad previously looked down on Yuno for being a peasant. Yuno often disregards Klaus' attempts at mentorship and instruction in favor of his own solutions to situations, something that causes Klaus grief on a regular basis. After working together to defeatMarsand escape the collapsingdungeon, Yuno and Klaus became friends. As fellow members of the Golden Dawn, Yuno has been on various missions alongsideMimosa Vermillion. More or less, Yuno gets along moderately well with Mimosa and views her as an important teammate and even friend as he is willing to protect her in battle if necessary, as during his andAsta's battle againstLichtended, Yuno used his magic to protect Mimosa from harms way. Langris Vaudeis the vice-captain of the Golden Dawn and therefore Yuno's superior. The two have a commonality of being blessed with powerful magic and being related to someone much less capable than them. However, while Yuno respects Asta, Langris belittles his older brother,Finral Roulacase, a member of theBlack Bulls. His affluent upbringing also makes Langris have a low opinion of commoners, which applies to Yuno, and finds his and Asta's open declaration to become the Wizard King embarrassing to hear. Because of this, Yuno and Langris act antagonistic towards each other with Yuno promising to become the next captain of the Golden Dawn to spite Langris and Langris trying to exercise his superiority over Yuno. However, this is shown to change as the former and present vice-captains team up to defeat theDark Triad. Alecdora Sandleris a comrade of Yuno in the Golden Dawn. At first, he and Yuno have a rocky relationship, with Sandler's ambitious personality making him jealous of Yuno's natural magic affinity, his successes and how he was able to gain Captain Vangeance's favor so quickly. He also disliked Yuno due to his lowly status. However, after Yuno saved Sandler when they were working together on a mission, their relationship improves. Sandler would later admit that he was envious of Yuno and now respects him as a dependable comrade."

This can be seen when she denies Asta's act of friendship while proclaiming that she has not given him permission to talk to her.[4] This also causes her to have difficulty admitting her failures, as she often tries to find excuses or blames her mistakes on somebody else.[10]After finally coming out of her difficulties in admitting her mistakes, Noelle can also be seen as very reserved on expressing her delight over her achievements where she would rather suppress those feelings and shows her usual stern expression.[11][12]She has a supposedly high sense of taste for items, as can be seen when she disdainfully says thatMagna Swing's broom is lame.[13] However, due to having been rejected by her own family, who had noticed and mocked her lack of control over her Magic Power, Noelle developed anxiety and an inferiority complex from having to contend with her highly accomplished brothers and sister. Her uncertainty around her magic control, her previous mistakes, and need to be accepted, leads Noelle to try and prove her family wrong to the point where she will overexert herself during simple training.[14]Her family's treatment has also caused her anxiety to develop into skepticism of most people's motives when she meets them, her since she expects them to react the same way.[15]She has also developed tsundere characteristics as she is not used to being praised or accepted which often causes her to act haughty in response to praise, particularly Asta. She is also rather modest, as she is mortified when she realizes her shirt is torn, showing her breasts slightly after the dungeon mission[16]and is also slightly embarrassed wearing her bikini at the beach.[17] Because of the Black Bulls' influence, notably Asta's, Noelle slowly begins to have more confidence in herself. This gives birth to a more courageous side where she is even willing to go against opponents likeVettoand her own brother,Solid. Kahonopoints out a reason that Noelle lacked magic control comes from a strong desire to not hurt anyone, which unconsciously caused her spells to miss the intended target. Her first use of strong and controlled magic was Sea Dragon's Nest, a defensive spell intended to protect those she was charged with helping. These actions show despite Noelle's shortcomings and arrogant facade, she has a kind heart, and wants to be of use to her friends and the people, which sets her apart from most nobles. She is not a pacifist by any means, as she is often seen using powerful and dangerous magic when pushed into a corner and refuses to give in to any opponent. Another aspect that sets her apart from other nobles is how she's less prejudiced towards commoners which was shown during theStar Awards Festivalwhere she comforts a child and declares everyone should enjoy the celebration regardless of their status. This confidence, courage, and kindness shapes Noelle a strong resolve to protect those she cares for, which creates a more selfless side to her personality. Though her growth is admirable, her noble pride and upbringing still causes her to not always be honest with herself or act in an arrogant way towards most others. She has had a consistent struggle admitting and accepting her strong love for Asta, regularly denying any attachment to him. Although Noelle finally admitted to herself she loves him after the fight against Megicula, her new awareness of her feelings made her so nervous that she struggles to even maintain a conversation with him."

(A: Nozel is Noelle's eldest brother, but she has a very difficult relationship with him. (A: Nozel is Noelle's eldest brother, but she has a very difficult relationship with him",Nozel,Family,"Nozelis Noelle's eldest brother, but she has a very difficult relationship with him. Nozel holds Noelle in poor regard because she could not control her powers at first, repeatedly lamenting and insulting her for it. She often has to deal with his constant ridicule, such as when he tells her she has shamedHouse Silvaand rhetorically asking how long is she going to continue embarrassing their family. This is contrasted by how he treats his other two siblings, Solid and Nebra, who, although talks to them with a level of superiority, still treats them with respect, advising them how to conduct themselves and not to waste their time with people likeAsta, seeing his siblings as superior to others. He cruelly puts the death oftheir motheron Noelle's shoulders, reminding her often that she is to blame. Before theMagic Knights Entrance Exam, he scolds her for partaking and tries to discourage her from becoming aMagic Knight, apparently for the sake of their family. However, Noelle remains defiant and gets selected byYamifor theBlack Bull, despite her inability to control her powers. Noelle is notably submissive towards Nozel, possible due to him being one of the top captains in theClover Kingdomand a force to be reckoned with, resulting in Noelle never standing up for herself in front of him as she feels powerless. The truth, however, is that Nozel sees a lot of their mother, Acier, in Noelle and is terrified of losing her like he lost his mother. Thus, his cruel treatment of her is to act as a sort of deterrent to prevent her from becoming a Magic Knight, but also to try and suppress these hidden feelings. The truth is revealed when he partners with Noelle to defend House Silva from possessed Magic Knights, where he openly admits these feelings in front of Solid and Nebra, stunning Noelle. He then apologizes for his years of poor treatment towards her. Nozel genuinely believed Noelle to be weak and worthless since she could not control her powers. However, her time with the Black Bull and Asta has turned her into a powerful mage, capable of controlling her powers and using strong magical attacks such asSea Dragon's Roar, surprising Nozel. It was upon seeing this that he decides to be honest with what he truly thinks of her. He starts to trust her judgement when he silently accepts Noelle's proposal to try and save the possessed Magic Knights rather than kill them, and later lets his protective side slip out when he stops Noelle from joining Asta andYunoto defendHagevillage. Solidis Noelle's brother and, much like her other two siblings, has an extremely poor relationship with her. Unlike his brother Nozel, he is much more sadistic in his treatment towards Noelle, taking joy in bullying and upsetting her. As children, he would take her toys away, tease her and tear them up, and would slap away her food because she started eating before him. He regularly belittled her because she could not control her magic. Their poor relationship is put on full display at theWar Merits Conferment Ceremony, when he singles her out as the most unwanted guest of all, pours his drink over her head and further insults and humiliates her, which incurs Asta's wrath when he sees what he is doing to her. He shares Nozel's opinion that Noelle is weak and worthless, a disgrace to the Silva family and to blame for their mother's death. Noelle is able to put Solid in his place during theRoyal Knights Selection Exam, where he continued with his belittling of Noelle and chased her throughout the match out of his desire to harm and demoralize her. She is able to defeat him with her Sea Dragon's Roar, completely shocking him that she could conjure up such a powerful spell and hit him with it. He is later stunned when Nozel apologizes for how badly he has treated her all these years. It is apparent early on that Noelle is fearful of Solid, more so than Nozel, because of his unpredictable and sinister nature, and his desire to embarrass and degrade her at every opportunity, whereas Nozel is mostly critical of her but would often just ignore her. However, she openly states to Solid that she is no longer scared of him, having grown tremendously under the Black Bulls, and by befriending Asta, becoming a powerful mage in her own right. Because she no longer fears him, she becomes inclined to protect him when he, along with Nebra, are being attacked by a possessed Magic Knight, surprising him yet again with her spells. Nebrais Noelle's one and only sister, but who is very close to Solid. As a result, she shares the exact same opinion as him, as well as Nozel, that she is a failure and an embarrassment to House Silva. She accompanies Solid pretty much everywhere and was present at the War Merits Conferment Ceremony when Solid began berating her, with Nebra commenting that she has been exiled from the Silva family and thus finds it insulting that she would return to the noble realm of the Clover Kingdom. When Solid is defeated by Noelle at the Royal Knights Selection Exam, she attempts to comfort him, and lightly teases him over the defeat, implying she still thinks poorly of Noelle. She is in disbelief to see Noelle use Sea Dragon's Roar and defeat the possessed Magic Knight, succeeding where she and Solid had failed. Nebra, along with Solid, is shocked by Nozel's change of attitude towards Noelle when he apologizes to her for how harsh he has treated her all these years. Mimosais Noelle's maternal cousin. Unlike Noelle's siblings, Mimosa has always been very kind to Noelle and admires her for her perseverance despite the torment she had to go through because of her siblings. Noelle viewed Mimosa as a klutz, who always seemed to comically fall over or hurt herself out of nowhere. Nonetheless, Noelle greatly appreciates Mimosa's friendship and found it a source of comfort in her childhood. Mimosa is frustrated by her inability to defend her cousin whilst many nobles mock her, knowing full well how hard Noelle trains to master her magic. This makes Mimosa one of the few nobles who shows both compassion and concern for Noelle. The two are reunited when they meet in thedungeonthat their respective squads are assigned to explore. After a few pleasantries between them they part ways after Asta challengesKlausto a race that he accepts. Noelle later finds Mimosa injured after a devastating attack byMars, greatly worrying her. She decides to protect Mimosa from Mars with her spell,Sea Dragon's Nest, whilst she recovers. Mimosa returns the favour later on when she uses her recovery magic on Noelle when she is critically injured by Mars. After the mission in the dungeon Noelle becomes shocked and flustered upon hearing Mimosa confession that she's developing feelings for Asta. This has made Noelle cautious, anxious, and even jealous numerous times around Mimosa whenever she interacts with Asta. However, Noelle's jealousy has not affected her friendly relationship with Mimosa. They both have shared similar levels of concern when Asta is in danger, or when another girl shows interest in him such asSally's obsession over him. Mimosa has always believed in Noelle's capabilities and is delighted to see how much she has grown from her time around Asta and the Black Bull. She cannot help but smile when Nozel shows his own acknowledgement by asking Noelle to help him defend theRoyal Capital. Her ancestor and the first wizard king, Noelle first meets him after escaping from the collapsing Shadow Palace. At first, Noelle didn't believe that the man standing before her was the actual legend but was shocked to learn that he really was the same person."
What is Mereoleona's mother's name?,Noelle,Magic knights,"Mereoleonawas very close to Noelle's mother, who was also her mentor, and has known Noelle since she was a child. The pair meet again for the first time in the story when Noelle is looking for Asta and, upon seeing Mereoleona, immediately tries to leave before she is grabbed by her and is taken to the hot springs for training alongside Asta, Yuno, Yami,Charlotte, andSol. She challenges everyone present to reach the summit of the volcano, but Noelle begins to falter, in response, Mereoleona challenges her to be more like her mother, invigorating Noelle. She tells Noelle that she looks a lot like her mother but that she is the complete opposite of her when it comes to magical power, but provides words of motivation and tells her to surpass her mother with strength that is all her own. Their relationship is very good between them, Mereoleona likes Noelle and has felt bad for how she has been treated by her siblings, as well having lost her mother. This makes Meroleona among the few nobles who treats Noelle with genuine sincerity. Compared to how she treats everyone else, Noelle is on her good side, she is much less aggressive and tries to act as a somewhat supportive mother to her. Noelle respects Mereoleona and takes a lot of her words to heart, recognising her wisdom and her strength. Mereoleona tends to fondly press her fist against Noelle's forehead as a way to reassure her. Similar to Asta, Noelle holdsFuegoleonin high regards. Seeing him as the embodiment of what it means to be a Magic Knights Captain. He holds no prejudice towards anyone and thus does not think poorly of Noelle's inability to control her magic, despite the expectations of her being a fellow royal. He was present when Noelle's siblings humiliated her at the War Merits Conferment Ceremony and chose to intervene on Asta's behalf after he got into a verbal and physical fight with House Silva. Fuegoleon took it upon himself to provide words of comfort to her during the invasion of the Royal Capital, whilst also reprimanding her for allowing what her siblings said to her to cloud her thoughts in the heat battle, telling her that is the difference between life and death. He finished off by telling her there is no shame in being weak, but there is shame in staying weak. She heeds his words and starts to fight with a clear mind. Although their time together was brief Noelle was devastated atFuegoleon being so critically injuredand tries to stop the bleeding as he is slowly dying. She later visited him, along with Asta, and discussed how great of a person he is with Fuegoleon's younger brother, Leopold. Her interactions withLeopoldhave been rare, but they share a friendly relationship. Leopold was present when Noelle was being humiliated by her siblings at the War Merits Conferment Ceremony and took a quick liking to Asta for his bold stance against them on Noelle's behalf. They worked together during the invasion of the Royal Capital, fighting off numerous undead enemies and trusting each other's abilities, eventually defeating all the enemies before them. She was urgently trying to bring Leopold back to his senses after he sees his brother on the brink of death and requesting his help to stop the bleeding. Noelle was present when Leopold officially declared to Asta that he will surpass both him and his brother to the title ofWizard King, not being able to help but smile at the two's determination. They are later seen at theUltime-Volcano Mountain Trailwhen they are stuck fighting a Borula, sharing a comical exchange when Noelle tells him to hurry up and defeat it, with Leopold retorting that she should do it since she has the elemental advantage. She comes to visit Fuegoleon with Asta where they find Leopold and have a pleasant discussion about Fuegoleon and how great of a person he was to them, hoping to comfort him about his brother's condition. Noelle first heard ofYunowhen Asta told her about his rivalry with him, and soon after met him when he saved her and Asta from a trap whilst inside the dungeon that both their squads were assigned to explore. They scarcely interacted with each other, but Yuno at one point does try to rescue both Noelle and Mimosa when Mars launches an attack on them. Noelle respects Yuno as Asta's rival and has been impressed by his skill and power throughout the story. They both share similar opinions of Asta, viewing him as annoying and irritating, but strong, capable and reliable. Yuno does not seem to think much of Noelle and once just referred to her as ""the girl that follows Asta around"". When they were put on the same team at the Royal Knights Selection Exam they immediately argued, with most of the vitriol coming from Noelle, especially when Asta was brought up and she became flustered. Yuno responded by calling her arguments childish and mostly disregarded a lot of her criticisms. However, the two were able to work well together in their matches despite an initial disagreement on who should lead the attacks. Although they had their initial hostilities, both of them acknowledge each other as capable mages. Noelle was impressed with Yuno's magic and the enormity of the power he possesses, whilst Yuno acknowledges Noelle's own abilities and trusted her enough to go after Team O's crystal and face Solid on her own. She wanted to join Asta and Yuno to defend Hage village but was stopped by Nozel. The two have had few interactions, but their relationship is positive. Noelle first metKlausin the dungeon that her squad was assigned to explore when Yuno saved her and Asta. Klaus introduced himself with some hostility, criticising Yuno for saving them both, seeing it as a waste of time. They would later fight side by side against Mars and it was Noelle that informed Klaus about Asta'sAnti Magic. Despite his earlier complaint to Yuno, he does, himself, try to save both Noelle and Mimosa from an attack by Mars but is unable to do so due to being trapped by Mars's magic. Since the encounter at the dungeon, Klaus's opinion of Asta, as well as Yuno, changed, creating a positive relationship that extended to Noelle. He was present at the War Merits Conferment Ceremony when he witnessed Solid insult Noelle and pour his drink over her, calling him out on such a cruel act. He tries to keep a level head around Noelle, and is the one to tell her about the simple reality that they cannot trace the people who kidnapped Asta when she was demanding they all search for him. He later reassures Noelle, as well as Mimosa, about Asta's well-being, commenting that he will not die so easily. At one point in the show, Klaus comically walks in on Noelle trying out some bikinis to go to the beach, mistaking her screaming for someone in distress, which causes him to temporarily pass out. Klaus is one of the few nobles who treats Noelle with respect, and has not shown any apparent disdain for Noelle's inability to not control her magic. Noelle respects Klaus as a friend and enjoys talking to him, as well as the rest of his squad. Another amusing bit between them is Klaus trying to act as a calming presence to Noelle, and Mimosa, when it comes to worrying about Asta, but will accidentally reveal that he is deeply worried for Asta, himself, in some comical fashion. During the Royal Knights Selection Exam, Noelle was partnered withEn, alongside Yuno, that made up Team P. Noelle did not think much of him on appearance and assumed he would be weak. She generally did not listen to his encouragement to her and ended up arguing with Yuno instead. Throughout their first match En acted as support and successfully took outDmitri Brintwhen he tried to partner up with Solid Silva to take out Noelle. Earlier on, En witnessed how Solid treats Noelle and was left incensed by his behaviour, holding a strong moral belief that older brothers must be supportive and protective of their younger siblings. He made these feelings clear when he spawned amushroomon Noelle's shoulder as she was squaring off with Solid and proceeded to criticise him, whilst also providing words of encouragement to Noelle. En thinks highly of Noelle's skills, praising her abilities after the match. She returns the compliment and notes that he seems to be more lively and confident when he is talking through his mushrooms. In the finale of the exam, En and Noelle showed they are capable of working together and teamed up to defend their crystal whilst Yuno took onRill Boismortier, and end up winning. Their relationship is friendly but Noelle cannot help but be startled whenever he spawns a mushroom and tries to communicate with her. Even though they rarely interact, Noelle's relationship withSekkeis comically poor. She finds him annoying, as most people do. Sekke first spotted Noelle, alongside Vanessa, in the black market part of Kikka, and tried to flirt with her, but was coldly rejected. Sekke was on the receiving end of one of Noelle's water blasts when she was pretending to be a barmaid in order to spy on Asta and Rebecca and he asked her for a drink, causing her to fire a water attack at him. Noelle would later call Sekke, accidentally, when she needed backup after some of the children had been taken away during the night, with Sekke maintaining his overly flirtatious attitude, much to her annoyance. He did, however, pull through for her and managed to get Yami and Finral to aid in the fight against the Eye of the Midnight Sun. Sekke stumbled across Noelle again at the beach and ordered his two followers, Aphro and Phati, to flirt with her, with them both being coldly rejected, as well. The two have not been seen interacting since, but Noelle has taken on Asta's nickname for Sekke and tends to refer to him as ""Bah-ha guy"" because of his excessive use of ""bah-ha""."
What is the name of Noelle's sister?,Kahono,Kiato,"Kiatoonly met Noelle after the fighting was over and the Eye of the Midnight Sun, and Vetto, had been defeated. He immediately became infatuated with her when she paid his sister a visit in the infirmary. He calls her beautiful, but Kahono quietly notes that Noelle is off the market because of her feelings for Asta. Due to her incredible water magic he comes to refer to her as the ""Sea Goddess"", as does most of the people at the Seabed Temple. He joins in with his sister's singing to serenade both Noelle and Asta as a way to say thank you and goodbye when they leave. He would not get to see her again until he and Kahono are invited by Asta to the Star Awards Festival. Here he has his foot repaired through the Witch Queen's magic and is able to dance again whilst his sister sings, pleasing the crowd and Noelle. Kahono suggests that she, Kiato, Noelle and Asta all go on a double date, misreading his sister's intentions and thinking she is trying to set him up with Noelle. Throughout the date he constantly tries to catch Noelle's attention but fails every time due to her attention being on Asta and Kahono, ultimately not being able to gain her affection, yet. Despite their infrequent interactions they are very friendly with each other and have a good relationship. Kiato is greatly impressed with Noelle's magic and she is impressed with his fighting through the use of his dancing skills."

What is Yami's penchant for intimidation?,whether he uses threatening words or physically harms his target,Personality,"Yami after Asta bumped him. Yami is uncouth, reckless, slovenly, carefree, impatient, lazy, slightly hypocritical, and prone to delivering death threats at the slightest provocation. Nevertheless, he is a powerful and well-respected Magic Knight who was able to recognizeAsta's merits when none of the other Captains would give him a chance. He is typically a stoic man who believes more in actions than in words. Yami is incredibly temperamental and hot-headed,since he can get irritated easily for the most idiotic reasons possible, such as; as being bumped by another person or interrupted when talking.[9]Yami also has a penchant for intimidation whether he uses threatening words or physically harms his target.[10][11]He also tends to immediately go straight for a more physical solution to any problems or confrontations, such as when he destroys a part of the squad's headquarters to calm his subordinates.[12]Despite being very bull-headed, reckless, unrefined and irresponsible, Yami is an experienced and perceptive warrior, picking apart his opponent's strategies with a glance and is constantly trying to come up with counters for them. Furthermore, he also prefers instilling tough love to his subordinates by giving them dangerous missions. He believes that it is the best way for them to overcome their limits and grow stronger.[13][14]Yami also does not discriminate people according to their social status or circumstances where he is willing to acceptLuck Voltia,Noelle Silva, andAstato join his ranks, even though he is aware of each of their problems.[14][15][16]His concern for them is likely tied to his own circumstances, being treated as an outcast in his youth like they are. Overall, although not openly demonstrated, Yami cares a lot about those under his command, seeing them more like family than subordinates. Even though Yami may treat some of them with complete disrespect , Yami still cares a lot about them. The biggest example of this was when the Magical Parliament intended to use Asta as a scapegoat for the war between the humans and the elves, Yami and the rest of the Black Bulls crashed the trial and were more than willing to become criminals and fugitives within the kingdom to protect Asta. Showing how dedicated, loyal and protective Yami truly is towards those he cares about."
Who does Yami recruit to the Black Bulls?,Asta,Black bulls,"Yami personally recruitsAstainto theBlack Bullsafter he takes an interest in him. He acts as a mentor figure to Asta, coming to his rescue after he is attacked byPatolliand teaching him how to useKi. He has a lot of faith in Asta's strength, and he has acknowledged Asta as the one responsible for the squad's improved strength and reputation. Yami's faith in Asta has not changed, as he openly stated during his battle with Dante Zogratis that he could not beat him without Asta's help, and asked Asta to get up and join the fight, which he happily did. He even trusts Asta enough to give him his katana to use against Dante, after Asta already used up all three of hisAnti Magicswords against him, and was glad when Asta defeated him with that sword. Yami recruitsNoelle Silvainto the Black Bulls despite her reputation as a failure of a royal. He has a lot of faith in her strength, and Noelle holds much admiration for Yami in turn, though she is sometimes put off by his gruff behavior. Yami andMagna Swingshare a strong, almost brotherly relationship. Magna is completely loyal to Yami, and Yami in turn will take Magna to go gambling at times. Yami accidentally freesVanessa Enotecafrom imprisonment in the Witch's Forest, and she later joins the Black Bulls out of respect for him. She appears to have a slight crush on him, but Yami remains oblivious to this. Despite having very little interaction withGrey, Yami acknowledges her as a member of the Black Bulls. He was more than willing to protect her and Vanessa from Dante Zogratis, stating that he would never let him have one of his people. Yami recruits Gauche to the Black Bulls despite him being an escaped prisoner at the time. Though Gauche rarely shows it, he holds a lot of respect for Yami and vice versa, though Yami is often put off by Gauche's obsession with his sister. Luck Voltiaholds Yami's strength in a high regard, and is always attempting to challenge him to a battle. Though Yami is sometimes put off by Luck's sociopathic behavior, he still acknowledges and highly regards Luck's battle strength and mana sensory abilities. Yami has a great amount of confidence inGordon Agrippaas a member of the Black Bulls. However, like most of the black bulls, Yami sometimes finds Gordon creepy, but does not hate being around him. Yami puts a considerable amount of trust inFinral Roulacaseand hisSpatial Magic. Though Yami often threatens Finral due to his cowardly behavior, he actually cares for him quite a bit and has confidence in his recovery after his battle with Langris. Yami is very fond ofCharmy Pappitson, and often enjoys her meals, despite sometimes being annoyed by her appetite. Yami has a surprising amount of faith in Charmy, as he has on more than one occasion given her important jobs to do. One example of this was when he tasks her with holding the prisoners from theSeabed Temple, as well as when he changed his mind about letting Asta go join the fight in the town ofKiten, even with both of his arms broken, only after Charmy volunteered to go with him too. Yami acknowledgesSecre Swallowtailas a member of the Black Bulls and even attacks theMagic Parliamentwith the rest of the Black Bulls to save her and Asta from being persecuted. Yami accidentally metHenry Legolantwhen he found his house in a search for a base for the Black Bulls. Henry told Yami about his condition, and offered to allow Yami to use his home as a base when he dies. Yami was immediately put off by the idea, and instead told him that he would fill the base with plenty of people so Henry would not die, and also recruited him as member of Black Bulls as well. Yami is not that bothered by Henry's magic or the fact that it constantly makes the base's layout change. Yami metZora Idealeduring one of Zora's missions to take out corrupt Magic Knights, and took an immediate liking to him. Despite openly recruiting Zora into the Black Bulls, Zora initially refused, not taking Yami's words or actions seriously. After hearing Yami out, Zora reluctantly changed his mind, deciding to take the Black Bulls' robe, but chose to not wear it and to continue his mission. After the events of theRoyal Knights Selection Exam, he began wearing his robe, and when he saw Yami again during the battle against the elves, he declared himself a member of the Black Bulls, with Yami visibly glad that he finally changed his attitude."

Emilia has a tendency to use a myriad of archaic words, such as ""dunderhead"". This quirk of hers is mostly pointed out by Subaru, who has a tendency to tease her about it, though Emilia doesn't pay it any mind. Fortuna has also questioned where she had picked up such a vocabulary. Furthermore, Emilia also has a strong tendency to drag out the word ""really"", which can be best observed when she's talking about something dear or important to her. This quirk was likely picked up from Fortuna, who had the same verbal tic. She is rarely angered by the people around her, only having been angered by the despicable actions ofPandora, Regulus, andAldebaran's betrayal thus far. She also has a strong belief in promises, having been raised by Fortuna to believe that if someone makes a promise, they should always keep them, something she took to heart not just with for thespiritsaround her but also with the people she interacts with, and it is because of this that she sometimes became emotional with Subaru, a habitual promise breaker. She is someone who believes in a person's good nature, and she displays a kindness similar to Subaru's, typically wanting to befriend others even despite race, appearance, and even position putting herself and others at odds, and she does not want to fight with others if she can help it, preferring to talk with her enemies and understand them rather than fight if it is an option. That said, if she is forced to, she will enter a fight with the intention of killing if it is necessary, though her fighting style still focuses on capturing her enemies alive, something very reminiscent of her gentle nature. Just like the other four Royal Selection Candidates, Emilia is also driven by a strong motive which shapes most of her actions, be it rational or irrational. Following her awakening by Puck in Elior Forest, she desperately tried to do something about the frozen elves in the forest. She cleaned them daily, talked to them, and spent a great deal of time and effort with them, trying to somehow get rid of their icy fate to absolutely no avail. However, a couple of months before the start of the main story, she was visited by an eccentric mage who introduced himself asRoswaal. Though they initially started off on the wrong foot which caused Roswaal and Puck to fight for half a day, the two decided to form a truce, and Roswaal presented Emilia with a plan that would allow her to unfreeze her people in the frozen Forest. By becoming the 42nd monarch of the Dragon Kingdom of Lugunica, Emilia would gain access to the Dragon's Blood locked up in the vaults of the Royal Castle. The Blood is said to have magical properties, and it could be able unfreeze the frozen inhabitants of the Great Elior Forest. Emilia hastily accepted the offer and decided to participate in the Royal Selection and forging a goal of having the Kingdom be equal and free from prejudice. Initially, because of her supposed ""selfishness"" as well as having to protect herself from the prejudice that was flung toward her, Emilia closed herself from others and did not entrust others with her emotions or how she felt about different situations she was subjected to, as she was always of the mindset to endure passively and maintain a valiant disposition. This resulted in her becoming both mentally and emotionally fragile, which in turned caused her to be overly obstinate and somewhat childish about certain subjects. This led her to always be dependent on other people such as Puck or Subaru for support, who had become her pillars of emotional support. Without them, she became more and more emotionally unstable, and at one point in a failed loop led her to believe that if she succeeded and completed the task that she had been entrusted, despite having failed so many times, Puck or Subaru would return to her. InArc 4, following her period of extreme emotional instability after Puck severed his contract with her and Subaru broke another promise with her, something that severely affected her since her only family had supposedly left her and her belief in promises was being casually left aside, she had completely lost faith in herself, leading her to hide from others. After having an argument with Subaru, however, in which she spilled all of her own insecurities onto him and believed that he was only looking at her through rose-colored glasses without seeing her flaws, not considering her feelings, not putting his faith in her like she was for him, and breaking his promises which she believed was a sacred thing, when Subaru not only threw all of these notions aside but even told her all of those flaws and frustrations to her face, told her what he believed, still claimed to love her in spite of this, and put his faith in her, she was able to stand up and challenge her painful past in order to overcome the three trials presented by theWitch of Greed. With this and seeing everything that Subaru had carved into Echidna's Tomb, Emilia became significantly mentally and emotionally stronger, able to withstand Roswaal's harassment, shake his beliefs and view of her, and keep faith in herself, and because of this, she started to become more charismatic and reliable, which even the stalwartRamhad come to truly respect, to the point that she wanted to entrust to her the Royal Selection for Roswaal's sake. In the end, she was able to overcome all of the trials, which each tested her mind and beliefs, and liberated the Sanctuary. Over the following year, Emilia developed a great deal of self-confidence and greatly improved her self-image even after her contract with Puck was severed, forcing her to break out of her shell and live on her own. Though her view on the world and human relations is still also rather childish and easy-going, she learned how to balance that shortcoming out with a level of professionalism and a unique air of authority. This change is particularly evident in the initial chapters of Arc 5, where some characters even point it out, and, according toHeinkel Astrea, the rumors surrounding her don't seem to be true anymore. Namely, her timidity and indecisiveness she was known for around the Kingdom was nowhere to be seen. She became much bolder, to the point that when she was captured by Regulus, rather than sitting and waiting for someone to rescue her, she took advantage of her position to gather information from the inside, relay that information to a reliable ally, and remain in her dangerous position so that she could protect everyone who was effectively being held hostage. Her kindness remained just as strong, something which led all of those hostages,Sylphy Elmartand the women Regulus took as his wives, to believe in her and entrust her with their fates. Also, despite understanding Subaru's feelings for her after he unleashed them all on her and even kissed her, because she didn't fully understand her own feelings nor the idea of what it meant to fall in love with someone, she did not improve in any romantic side. Though, she did believe that she knew who she would fall in love with. Over time, she began to exhibit other sides of herself when the situation involved Subaru. In Arc 5, when she was split up from Subaru, she believed that he would be able to find and fight alongside her, which was further reinforced when he gave his speech toPriestella. In Arc 6, she started showing signs of jealousy after seeingShaula's interactions with him, and when Subaru lost his memories, she became very anxious, wanting to hear him refer to the nickname he had given her and say the habitual lines he was known to say. Likewise, when her name was temporarily eaten, though she was a little shaken, her morale was tremendously boosted after Subaru not only retrieved his memories but even remembered her, which allowed her to fight to her best. Following Subaru's being taken toVollachia, she showed great resolve to go find him, even being willing to risk smuggling herself into the country, despite her position and the closed borders. InArc 8, she showed to be much bolder about her relationship with Subaru, even claiming that while she was not his, he was hers, and she was shown willing to trust in his heavy decision to acceptSpica, in spite of herpast. InArc 9, following his capture, she even showed to be extremely angry when he was betrayed by someone he was worried about, felt the urge to go assist him immediately, and even started to recognize an unknown emotion inside of her towards Subaru, which she failed to place but led her to want to be near him again."
How long did Emilia live in the now snow-covered Elior Forest? Available choices: (A). Seven years. (B). Seven years. (C). Seven years. (D). Seven years.,(B).,Bonds of ice,"Roughly seven years before the start of the Royal Selection, the ice around Emilia melted and Emilia met Puck. The two began to live in the now snow-covered Elior Forest. Exposed to the outside world for some time now, Emilia came to face the hostile reality of what it meant to be a half-elf in the world, especially one with her appearance which was nearly identical to that of the infamousWitch of Envy. Following those days, she suffered many hardships, not just from neighborhood human towns that feared her, hated her, betrayed her, and attempted to sell her into slavery, but even from higher beings such as one of theFour Great Spirits,Melakuera, who governed fire mana who sought to exterminate her for the crime of her existence and dangerous power that slept within her. Because of these issues, Emilia minimized any contact with outsiders, sticking to a frugal life by only leaving the forest to trade the magic stones she could find with people willing to deal with her in nearby towns for food and clothing. Humans, who called her the Witch of Frost, mostly tried to avoid her when she came around, but other than these excursions, Emilia would otherwise stay with the frozen elves as a guardian, as they were connected to her past. After the harrowing incident with Melakuera, Emilia formed a contract with Puck to preserve his life after his Od had been damaged. Puck then began to act as her surrogate father and mentor. He used the contract itself to seal parts of her memories that had been tampered with by Pandora.[5] Several months before Subaru arrived, she and Puck were visited by an eccentric man who named himself Roswaal L. Mathers, the first human who didn't react negatively to her appearance. He then invited her to the Royal Selection after being chosen by the Dragon Jewel by giving her a way to save the citizens of Elior Forest, through the usage of the Dragon's Blood.[6]"
What did the group decide to do with Roswaal to retrieve Subaru and Rem?,sneak into Vollachia,Stand by me pleiadesandmissing child search,"Following the successfulPleiades Watchtower Expedition, the group returned to Roswaal Manor to discuss what to do with Roswaal to retrieve Subaru and Rem. Offering up the cost, Roswaal hadClinduse his Authority to teleport everyone where they needed to be, leavingAnastasia Hoshinand her knightJulius Juukuliusto their own methods, and leavingMeili Portroutein the Royal Capital withAnnerose Miload. The group decided to sneak into Vollachia via the cityPicoutatte, which rested near the Vollachian border. After settling the issue betweenOtto SuwenandDiadora Regundra, everyone passed through the Everlasting Darkness with the help of the mole people. However, because of the fear of a second Demi-Human War, the moleperson representativeMusicatemporarily stopped them from moving forward on behalf of his people. After some negotiations withPetra Leyte, who realized the molepeople's true intentions to sacrifice themselves, the group settled on the molepeople eventually meeting with Emilia in the future, and the camp successfully snuck into Vollachia."

What is Rem's worldview?,only Ram and things directly related to Ram are important,Personality,"Rem is a competent, loyal person who always tries her best. Burdened by a sense of atonement toward Ram, she overworks herself, doing things in a way she believes her sister would. Rem possesses a narrow worldview. From her perspective, only Ram and things directly related to Ram are important. This leads Rem to make rash decisions to protect her community, without needing to think twice about the situation. In public, Rem is someone who maintains an emotionless expression, not displaying feelings like sadness or anger to maintain formality. She speaks politely to others, even if she dislikes them internally. Additionally, she possesses a sharp tongue and can unknowingly say blunt or critical things to the people she interacts with. While calm on the surface, in intense situations, Rem often gets tunnel vision and locks onto a singular objective. She tends to try to do everything on her own, bearing the burden of everything on her shoulders. She constantly puts herself down while propping her sister up, which has led to an inferiority complex, and this complex deepened as a result of her guilt from feeling the slightest hint of joy after her sister's horn was severed, leading her to aim for becoming a perfect servant to atone for what she felt she had robbed from Ram. Furthermore, she has a deep sense of hatred for theWitch Cultand believes that nothing good can come from the Witch’s scent. Thanks to the assistance of Subaru, Rem’s view of the world began to expand. No longer thinking of herself as her sister’s substitute, she started developing stronger bonds with the people around her. Rem felt grateful to Subaru for helping her move forward and developed a deep love for him, becoming one of his most loyal followers. To the point that she always believes in him as her ""hero"" no matter what, even if Subaru himself for some reason loses faith in his abilities, thereby serving him as an important emotional support even when she is not around. She still maintains a low opinion of herself and can fall back into self-deprecation when comparing herself to Ram. After Rem's confession, she becomes more open and honest about her feelings for Subaru. She boldly declares her love to the people around her. Her heart opened in a true sense, and she diminished the emotional restrictions she once had. Likewise, Rem displays great protectiveness, healing and defendingCruschagainstRegulusand Lye, two Sin Archbishops, even though her loss was certain. After having awoken from her year and a half slumber, Rem acquired amnesia which left her in a state similar to that of Crusch at the end of Arc 3. In this state, rather than referring to herself by her name as she had before, she referred herself withIormy, and she tended to refer to Subaru asthat person. She was very wary of everyone, especially Subaru, even going as far as trying to strangle him twice and set up decoy paths and traps in order to get away from him, as she considers him dangerous due to a combination of the overwhelmingWitch's Scent seeping from him after his numerous deaths, as well as his resentment forRuiand refusal to help her in her current state, as Rem saw her as just an innocent child. After some time, she became less wary of those around her, and she came to accept her name as her own, despite initially not feeling as though it was. She often showed kindness to people likeKatya Aurélie, acting similarly to how Subaru was to her as Katya tried to push her away, and she has shown to similar fondness to Ram as she used to. Though she still acts particularly harsh towards Subaru, she has also shown her protective side as well, going out of her way to attackToddwhen he was in danger, as well as a slightly envious side, which she displayed numerous times when he interacted withEmilia. Currently, followingRoy Alphard's regurgitation of her, Rem seems to have regained her original memories, returning to referring to herself by name and Subaru as ""Subaru-kun"" again."
What ability does Rem share with her sister?,Synesthesia,Abilities,"Magic: Rem is skilled at water magic. Roswaal, who taught her how to use it, estimates her skills being above average but nothing exceptional. She is able to attack and heal using her magic. Rem receiving a warning from Ram, throughSynesthesia. Synesthesia: An ability that she shares with her sister. It allows them to share their feelings with each other through telepathy. This ability debuted during Arc 3 when Rem brought Subaru to the mansion, and halfway through, Rem received the same damage as Ram when she died. During Arc 6, it's revealed that it can also be used to transmit mana, allowing Rem to effectively serve as ""Ram's horn"". Oni Bloodline: As she is an Oni, Rem can enter her Oni form, manifesting a single white horn on her forehead. Like the rest of her race, she has physical attributes that surpass that of regular humans, and those attributes are enhanced further when she manifests her horn. She is capable of killingwitchbeastswith her bare fists and showed no strain in carrying Subaru. However, her ferocity is also increased, and if she is not careful, she could lose herself to her instincts and try to kill everything in sight. Furthermore, if she overexerts herself while her horn is manifested, it is likely that the recoil would render her weak. As a twin, Rem was born with a single horn that appeared smaller than an average Oni's, meaning her power in her Oni state was lower than her kin's. Similarly, being Ram’s twin, Rem can temporarily act as her horn and give her access to more of her power. However, doing so interferes with her body’s internal mana circulation, which once made it difficult for her to use her legs. Unknown Ability: Rem can smell the Witch's Scent, something that only a few individuals in the series so far, are capable of doing. It is currently unknown how Rem is capable of doing this, though it most likely stems from the night her village was attacked and destroyed by the Witch Cult, as prior to that event, Rem never displayed such an ability. It is revealed byEchidnainRe:IF Kasaneruthat this is a natural ability of the Oni tribe as well as their purpose for existing despite the fact that her sister does not appear to possess this power. Equipment: Rem wields a weapon called theMorningstar in combat. The weapon takes shape of a giant metal spiked ball on long metal chains. She can use the Morningstar for offense as it's capable of dealing devastating injuries to her opponents."

Ram (A). Ram (B).,Roswaal,Personality,"Ram is seemingly self-centered, sardonic, and does things at her own pace. However, in actuality, she maintains a distance from people to ascertain them. She is slightly more outgoing in comparison to the generally taciturn Rem, who generally allows Ram to take the lead in their sisterly bond. Her sardonic remarks are her way of teasing others. While she's cold and snarky outwardly, she is caring of others around her deep down, and she is surprisingly kind and forgiving towards others. While Ram tends to come off as rather lazy in her work as a maid, often seen taking breaks and doing a shoddy job with whichever task she is given, in truth, her body, which is constantly experiencing pain from the severance of her horn, prevents her from doing as much. Because of this, she does whatever work she physically can, which includes completing documents related to the affairs of the Mathers Domain whenever Roswaal in unable to, though she keeps this a secret from her sister. Also, when she was young, she often experienced impulses driving her to fight and kill, and those impulses only got stronger as she aged and got more powerful. She resisted them for a long time until the day that her horn was severed from her, which effectively ended those impulses. Despite the pain that comes with the loss of her horn and the restraint of most of her strength behind ""shackles"", however, she actually believed that it was a good thing, which she affirmed during her battle withLye Batenkaitos, when she realized her impulse to kill would be far too hard to resist if they had remained. Throughout her life, even as early as shortly after her birth, Ram was extremely protective of her sister, Rem. Because of her sheer genius and her position in the Oni Clan, she recognized Rem's inferiority complex and often did everything she could to include her in various small tasks like cooking, and she did everything she could to protect her. Even as her village was destroyed, her priority was saving her sister over the other members of the clan. Likewise, she even decided to serve Roswaal to protect her, as she was aware of Roswaal's knowledge of the attack on their village and his use of her sister as a hostage. Like her protectiveness of her sister, her hatred of Roswaal was something that dominated her mind throughout her life. However, this hatred eventually shifted to a complicated devotion to him, and after she lost memories of Rem, everything that complicated their relationship vanished, which transformed those feelings from devotion to love, and in her love, she would be willing to do everything she could to set the man on the right path, even if it means getting in the way of his dream or exposing herself to danger by his hands. During times of emergency, Ram has a tendency to hide her worry and concern under her usual demeanor, consistently acting as though she was unbothered. Despite this, when information reaches her ears regarding those she is worried about, she has no issue pointing her wand at someone she is friendly with, claiming that if they were to get in her way that she would kill them regardless of who they are, such as when she was confrontingSerena Dracroywhen Rem andSubaruwere inVollachia. Likewise, in times of extreme stress, she will become very emotional and act in denial. When Subaru, whom she often relies on and places a considerable amount of trust in, and who was the only person who remembered her sister after her name and memories were devoured by Gluttony, lost his memories, she confronted him while not believing him, claiming that it was an act, and even when he told her that it was not an act, she was immensely shaken, yelled at him, and held him against the wall in frustration. In one failed loop, she even flew into a murderous rage when she believed he was an impostor."
Who is the second coming of the Oni God?,Ram,The oni sisters of the hidden village,"As the prodigious elder twin, Ram was born with extraordinary talent for mana manipulation and a powerful body to match that made her the pride of the Oni village, as, according to the chief of the village, she was the second coming of the Oni God. Her aptitude didn't just lie there, she excelled in everything - from cooking to physical activities - and was showered in adoration, even by her own sister. However, she never let any of it get to her head and never forgot her little sister, no matter how much attention was paid to her. During the night of the attack by the Witch Cult, when all the Oni fell, she alone kept fighting to avenge them and protect her sister. But the cult outnumbered her, and she made a last-ditch effort to shield a petrified Rem from being cut down. In mere moments, Ram lost her horn when it was sliced off from her head as a result of that. Had it not been for a passing mage at the time whom they came to know as Roswaal L. Mathers, they would not have survived the massacre. The next several years since then, Roswaal would gain the twins' eternal gratitude and fervent loyalty. Roswaal would also ensure that Ram received regular mana infusions and served as her lifeline. During the early days of her life atRoswaal Manor, Ram would also come to know the partial truth of the cult's raid that night, as well as the identity of the cult member responsible for cutting off her horn,Faust, with assistance from Roswaal, and achieved her vengeance. Ram is the only person who knows about Roswaal's gospel and had formed a contract with him that stipulated that his life would be hers if the future ever deviated from its predictions as penance for knowing about the attack and letting it happen for his own ends."

What is the name of the kidnapper that gets kidnapped in exchange for the Death Note?,Takimura,Part ii,"After five years of everything going swimmingly,Takimura, the head of the NPA, gets kidnapped in exchange for the Death Note. At the same time, an FBI agent,John McEnroe, confronts Soichiro, and asks for the Death Note. This FBI agent also seeks cooperation from the Task Force to rescue Takimura from the kidnappers. Light feels obligated to get rid of the kidnappers as well as the American organization as soon as possible, as they are currently the only people besides the Task Force who know of the existence of the Death Note. Light kills Takimura so that they no longer have a bargaining chip to trade the Death Note for, and it wouldn't look suspicious as one could easily assume the kidnappers killed him. However, the kidnappers then announce that they have kidnapped Sayu Yagami, which puts Light under pressure. In order to get help, he contacts the organization which John McEnroe offered to have them to talk to, and Light talks toNearfor the first time, who introduces himself as N and is aware of the previous L's death. Near letting Light know of him having knowledge of the previous L's death. Light tells Near the current situation and Near surveils the site of the trade using satellites. The exchange goes through, with the kidnappers gaining the notebook. Near decides that he should chase the kidnappers on his own, only for his plan to fail as Mello uses the Death Note to wipe out more than half his team. Light takes advantage of this incident to trade all that he knows about the notebook for information on the perpetrator of the kidnappings. Near tells Light that someone using the nicknameMello, who is using the Mafia, is behind the kidnappings, and Light has the Task Force investigateWammy's House, informing Light of Mello's motives. The presidentcalls Light, and Light figures out that Mello had blackmailed him. So, Light takes advantage of this to have the president organize a raid led byYitzak Ghazanin. Light learns the location of Mello and the Mafia by taking control of the current Death Note owner and having him mail him their location. However, the raid fails thanks to the intervention ofSidoh, a Shinigami working with the Mafia. Soichiro dies Light then has Misa send a message to the Task Force as Kira, that Kira relinquished ownership of his Death Note to one of the members of the Task Force in order to attack the Mafia and regain the notebook. Light had expected Matsuda to gain ownership and make the Shinigami Eye deal, but, unfortunately for Light, Soichiro does so instead. The raid commences and they regain the Death Note, and Light tells them to confront Mello. Soichiro threatens Mello rather than killing him, givingJosethe opportunity to shoot Soichiro severely. Mello then blows up the base and escapes, but Soichiro manages to give out Mello's real name to Light. Soichiro then dies in the hospital, after seeing that Light's lifespan was not absent, proving to him that Light was not Kira. Near tries to make the Task Force members doubt Light. Light selectsDemegawaas the Kira spokesperson, intending to spread Kira's word in order to gain more power to take down Near and Mello. Thanks in part to David Hoope's death and the battle with the Mafia, the United States submits to Kira and dissolves theSPK, the organization Near is running. Near, deducing that the second L is Kira, calls Light and claims that he has interrogated Mello, and that he learned that there are fake rules. Near disproves the 13-day rule, and gives pieces of evidence to the Task Force pointing towards the second L being Kira, instilling some doubt within the Task Force in an effort to turn them against the second L. Mello contactsMogiand tells him to follow Mello to New York, which Mogi does so under the supervision of Light and the Task Force. However, Mello has Mogi go to the SPK's headquarters, which puts Light under extreme pressure as Mello and Near are constantly pressuring Mogi into spilling information. On one hand, if Light lets Mogi live, he might spill information that would be detrimental for Light, but if Light kills him, it'd only incriminate him. Luckily for Light, Mogi doesn't give away any information. However, as he can't guarantee that, and in order to kill off Near and Mogi, Light sends Demegawa and tons of other Kira followers to attack Near. However, Near uses L's inheritance to distract the crowd and escape. Near lies to the Task Force, claiming Mogi had died of a heart attack. This stirs suspicion against Light, which results inAizawagiving Near lots of information, which has him believing that Light Yagami is the second L and Kira, while Mogi returns to the Task Force. Light now expects tighter surveillance now that Near turned the Task Force against him, so he has Misa relinquish ownership of her notebook toTeru Mikami, who kills Demegawa for running amok, testifying his worth. Mikami then selectsKiyomi Takadaas the new Kira spokesperson, who coincidentally had a past relationship with Light. Light takes advantage of this to use Takada to talk to Mikami. He does this while satisfying the Task Force, under the guise that he is investigating her. As a result, the Task Force relocates their investigation back to Japan, with the SPK eventually following suit. During a meeting between Light and Takada, Mikami calls them, and Light manages to confirm to Mikami that Light is Kira, and Mikami confirms to Light that Mikami is the new Kira proxy via subtle communication. Light then says that all the Task Force's surveillance cameras and most of the wiretaps must be removed as per Kira's request. Light then privately reveals to Takada that he is Kira. For the rest of his meetings with Takada, Light and her communicated by writing notes as the Task Force placed a wire on Light. Light instructs Takada to tell Mikami to forge a fake notebook and use that fake to write down names in public, while he sends Takada the real names so she can do the killings. Light's incentive is that, for his final confrontation with Near, he expects Near to swap his notebook with a fake, which is why he's already preparing a fake. Light also has Mikami say things in public, suggesting Ryuk hasn't been following him. This way, when Near touches the Death Note, he won't think that there is no Shinigami because the notebook is fake. Light's plan goes perfectly, with Near's agent,Stephen Gevanni, having swapped the pages of Mikami's fake notebook. Near and Light subtly make declarations of their battle. Near, at some point following his relocation to Japan, calls Light to confirm his presence there under the pretense of cooperating in their investigation while subtly declaring his intent to challenge him. After Gevanni acquires the fake notebook, Near later calls the Task Force and informs them of a meeting Near wants to arrange in attendance with the SPK, taking place at theYellow Box Warehouse. Light anticipates this meeting and revels in the idea that this meeting will be the day he can finally eliminate all his enemies and truly begin the creation of his new world. However, not too many days before the planned meeting, Takada suddenly gets kidnapped by Mello. Takada successfully manages to kill Mello, while Light kills Takada using a fire to remove any evidence. The meeting between the Kira Task Force and SPK commences two days later, and Mikami arrives during the meeting to write the names of everyone present in the notebook, save for Kira's. Having prepared a fake all along, Light had expected to win, as he had planned things out so that Mikami would bring the real one. However, it is revealed to be a fake. Near reveals that Mikami had actually written down Takada's name after her kidnapping, not knowing Light did the same. This allowed Near to seize the real notebook that Mikami had used to write down her name. Light attempts to justify his actions to the Task Force and SPK. Light, after being exposed as Kira, attempts to deny it, but with his declaration of victory as well as the evidence Near provided, everyone is convinced Light is Kira. Light laughs maniacally and attempts to tell them the benefits of Kira's world, as well as trying to convince them that his intentions were unselfish and, thus, justified. However, Near responds by saying that everyone has a right to choose what they think is right or wrong, while Kira is simply an evil ""mass murderer"", killing people to selfishly force his personal utopia onto others. When Light scans the room to see what the others think, he is met with cold gazes that confirm their rejection of his new world. Light then decides to distract everyone in the room by presenting the possibility that the notebook brought from the task force could be fake. While mid-speech he swiftly tries to use the scrap of the note in his watch to kill Near. Matsuda responds by shooting Light, interrupting him then berates him for driving his own father to his death for his vision. Light then tries to continue to finish writing the name using his blood from the gunshot wound.Matsuda, enraged at Light, shoots at Light multiple times, leaving him severely injured. The task force then disarms Matsuda before he kills Light in his fit of rage and also takes the note scrap as well so it couldn't continue to be used."
What does Mikami do after he sees Light in a wounded state after being shot?,commits suicide,Fate,"Humiliated, Light dies an agonizing death in the manga. Light is left incapacitated both physically and mentally. Light yells for Mikami to write down the names of everyone present, but Mikami responds by asking how he is supposed to kill them with a fake notebook. This brings Mikami to the realization that Light is not ""God"". Light becomes increasingly distraught and begins asking for help from Misa, only to be told that she isn't here. He then asks for Takada and is told that she is dead. In complete desperation, Light begsRyukto help him by killing everyone in the room, yet Ryuk reminds Light that he is on neither side. Ryuk fulfills his promise from the beginning: he writes ""Light Yagami"" inhis Death Note, and Light futilely begs Ryuk to reverse the process. He begins to panic, repeating in his head ""I don't want to die,"" before the Death Note finally takes effect, thus killing him. Quietly escaping, Light passes away peacefully in the anime. Upon seeing Light in a wounded state after being shot, Mikami commits suicide by stabbing himself with his pen, causing a diversion for both the Task Force and the SPK. Although weakened and suffering from severe blood loss, Light uses the last of his strength to flee the warehouse.[6]Following Light's escape, Near tells Aizawa,Mogi,Ide, and Matsuda that there is no reason to pursue Light, given that there should be no more hidden Death Note pieces and Light's wounds would prevent him from getting far. Aizawa refuses to heed Near's orders and has his team follow Light. After Light settles in another warehouse to hide in, Ryuk writes Light's name in his notebook. As Light silently dies, an illusion of L appears before Light, mirroring a scene following L's defeat at Light's hands inepisode 25. At the end ofDeath Note Relight 2: L's Successors, Aizawa and Matsuda are revealed to have found the warehouse Light has fled to; their expressions of shock imply that they have seen Light's body."
Who is taking over the role for the 2017 Korean production?,Han Ji-Sang,The musical,"Hong Kwang Ho as Light duringWhere is the Justice? Light is very similar to his canon self in themusical, and the story approximately follows canon up through Misa's confinement. Light does not volunteer for confinement, and the final confrontation with L happens soon after instead. Believing that Light can no longer entertain him after he has eliminated L, Ryuk kills Light in the final scene. Light is portrayed by various actors for the different musical productions. Kenji Urai and Hayato Kakizawa shared the role in the 2015 Japanese production, and they will both reprise the role for the 2017 Japanese production. Hong Kwang-Ho portrayed the character for the 2015 Korean production, and Han Ji-Sang is taking over the role for the 2017 Korean production. Jeremy Jordan voiced Light for the English-language 2014 New York studio demo recordings. Light performs the following songs in the Musical:"

Tsugumi Ohba,A).,Conception,"The following information is fromDeath Note 13: How to ReadandDeath Note /A Official Analysis Guide of the Animation. Tsugumi Ohba: Writer Takeshi Obata: Artist Ohba said that Light was ""a young man who could understand the pain of others"" when he first encountered the Death Note. Ohba said that if Ryuk had never developed an interest in the human world, Light would have become ""one of the greatest police leaders in the world"" who, with L, worked against criminals. Ohba described Light's life as ""ruined"" once he obtained the Death Note, and that Light became a victim of the Death Note ""in many ways"". Ohba described Light as bearing good faith intentions and having a ""very conceited"" nature, as reflected in his ""warped"" ""desire to be godlike,"" whilst bearing love for his family, and intending to transform the world into ""a better place"". Ohba added that he believed that debating whether Light's actions were good or evil is not ""very important"", though he personally sees Light as a ""very evil"" character. According to Ohba, Light seesMisa Amane, who he uses as an accomplice, as a ""bad person"" who killed non-criminals, so he acts emotionally cold towards her and manipulates her. Despite this, he keeps her alive even after her memories of being Kira have been removed for the second time. Light's surname ""Yagami"" includes the Kanji for ""night"" and ""god"", while his given name is written with the Japanese character for ""moon"". Ohba stated that his editor suggested the family name ""Yagami"", and did not feel ""too concerned"" about the meaning of the name. However, during the final scene in the manga, in which a group ofKira worshipersappear under a moonlit night sky, Obha stated he ""liked"" how the final scene ended up creating a ""deeper significance"" in the name. When asked about which character was most similar to himself, Ohba indicated Near and ""maybe Light."" Regarding Light, Ohba cited ""because I did well in school."" Obata said that Light was his second favorite human character and that he was not sure whether that was because he ""liked"" Light or because he drew ""such an evil character"" in a magazine for children. Obata said that he had ""no trouble"" designing Light as the character description presented to him: ""a brilliant honors student who's a little out there,"" and was ""clear and detailed."" As the weekly serialization continued, Obata simplified the design by unconsciously removing ""unnecessary"" lines and felt that he became ""better"" at drawing Light. When Chapter 35 appeared and the editor informed Obata that Light lost his memories, Obata felt that he had to ""forget everything he learned"" and draw Light in a similar manner as he appeared in Chapter 1. Adult Light in the manga. He was typically assigned a ""lack of color"" by Obata. Obata said that he used ""a lot of effort"" to design Light's wardrobe. According to Obata, he encountered difficulty imagining the clothing of ""a brilliant person,"" so he looked through fashion magazines. Obata envisioned Light as a ""smart and formal guy"" who wears formal shirts. Most of Light's clothing inDeath Noteis ""fitted"" and Obata avoided jeans. In pages where Light was drawn in color, such as magazine or volume covers for the manga, Obata assigned clear or ""lack of a color"" to Light. Light's emotions were deliberately communicated through his eyes in the anime. Several creative decisions were made in the process of adapting Light for the anime. For instance, the color red was often assigned during scenes where Light demonstrates killing intent, especially during scenes where he is contemplating plans to kill his opponents.[7]There are several scenes where Light's eyes depict lifelessness, primarily representing his boredom,[8]though Light's voice actor, Mamoru Miyano, suggests the lifeless eyes may also represent underlying feelings of emptiness.[9]"

How does Misa feel after seeing her parents murdered?,incredibly grateful,Character,"Misa is very outgoing and is shown to be quite popular due to her career. She attracts a large crowd while visiting Light at his university campus.[5]She is hyperactive, impulsive, and otherwise childlike, evidenced by her tendency to speak in the third person. Despite being considered idiotic by many, Misa is shown to have moments of intelligence, such as when she successfully tricksKyosuke Higuchiinto revealing himself to be theYotsuba Kira.[6] She is very careless in her acts as the Second Kira, which leads to her being arrested and put in confinement. As she likely didn't know the Death Note could manipulate victims, she mailed theKira tapesherself but failed to remove her fingerprints and left easily-found DNA on the envelopes. She also completely ignored Light's order to stay away from him and thus was seen in his company — narrowing down L's suspicions as to who was the Second Kira. Despite her typically cheerful personality, Misa has been mentally afflicted by seeing her parents murdered right before her eyes. It is unclear how much the trauma has affected Misa psychologically, but in the films, Rem indicates that Misa went through a deep depression immediately after she discovered the murderer was acquitted of the crime. After the murderer is later killed by Kira, Misa is incredibly grateful, and her intense appreciation and hero-worship initially fuels her actions as the Second Kira. After she becomes emotionally attached to Light, her behavior is strongly motivated by love. Misa is very reckless with life, both her own and others. She has few qualms about twice halving her lifespan in order to get theShinigami Eyeswhich she uses to kill innocent people in order to get her way. These include news broadcasters who were critical of Kira and policemen who meddle with her plan to meet Kira.[7] Although she is generally nice to those she meets, she can also be quite cruel: she tells Light that she would kill any other girls he dates,[8]despite said girls being part of his plan to appear as a normal young man to the investigators and deflect suspicion from himself and Misa. Light Yagami is an important figure in Misa's life, and she frequently comments on him being so, often declaring her love for him despite little reciprocation. She is faithful to Light to the point of refusing to perform a kiss with fellow actorHideki Ryugawhile making a film out of her fidelity. When she and Light lose their memories of being Kiras, she agrees to help captue Kira, whom she views as the avenger of her family, out of love for Light."
What was the name of the stalker that Misa met?,AShinigaminamed Gelus,History,"A year before the start of the series, Misa witnessed the murder of her family during an attempted home robbery. The trial against her parents' murderer continued over a long stretch of time, during which opinions that he was falsely accused began to surface. After he was killed by Kira, Misa felt justice had been served, prompting her to become a loyal Kira supporter. One night, shortly after beginning her modeling career, Misa met an obsessed, knife-wielding stalker. He confessed his feelings to Misa, but upon her rejection, he attacked and attempted to kill her. AShinigaminamedGelus, who had been watching Misa from theShinigami Realmand had fallen in love with her, wrote down the name of her stalker and killed him, ultimately saving Misa's life. Since Shinigami are meant to shorten human lifespans and not extend them, Gelus himself died, turning to dust and leaving behind only hisDeath Note. Since Misa was meant to die, but was saved by Gelus, her lifespan was ultimately extended in the process. Another Shinigami,Rem, witnessed the sacrifice and decided that Gelus' notebook should belong to Misa in accordance with Gelus' wishes. After giving Misa the Death Note, Rem was obligated to stay with her , and Rem eventually develops feelings for her over time as Gelus did. In the hope of meeting and thanking Kira for avenging her parents, Misa made theeye dealwith Rem, she uses this ability to track downLight Yagami."
"What does Misa do during her show ""Misa-Misa's Happy Sweets"" in which she bakes treats, playfully planning to make her love-rivals fat but then saying that they're so good that she ends up eating the treats herself?",bakes treats,Film series,"Misa as she appears in the first three films Misa is portrayed in theDeath Notefilm seriesbyErika Toda. Misa's role is very similar to her canon self in that she uses her Death Note to support Kira and she falls in love with Light. Her career is also further developed with her being an actress, TV personality, and singer. In addition to her parents, she had a younger brother who was also murdered, and their murderer is named as Yoichi Tamura. In thefirst film, Misa has a recurring background role as a popular idol. An ad for her is printed on the side and back of the bus that Light,Shiori Akino, andRaye Iwamatsuare on when it is hijacked byKiichiro Osoreda. Misa during her show ""Misa-Misa's Happy Sweets"" Misa notably has a TV show called ""Misa-Misa's Happy Sweets"" in which she bakes treats, playfully planning to make her love-rivals fat but then saying that they're so good that she ends up eating the treats herself. Light has her show on while in his bedroom. During the program, Ryuk laughs upon seeing Misa, probably foreshadowing that he knows she is going to die soon. After filming a segment of her show, she expresses support for Kira to a journalist during an interview. A supervisor states that the section will be cut due to controversies. Ryotaro Sakajo, the assistant director for her show, develops an obsession with her. Misa once blows her nose into a tissue and throws it away, and Sakajo takes it out of the trash to keep. At the end of the first film, Sakajo follows Misa one night with a knife, and she runs from him screaming for help, but ends up at a dead end. He plans to kill her and himself so she can be with her parents again, but he collapses before he's able to do so. A Death note falls beside his dead body. The second film,Death Note: The Last Name, begins during this same scene, but it showsGeluswatching the events from theShinigami Realmand he writes Sakajo's name in his Death Note. Gelus's Death Note then falls in front of Misa, who picks it up and meetsRem. Misa sends her envelopes to Sakura TV from Kita-ku, Osaka. Her message airs while she is in her private dressing room at the station. It's also during a TV festival attended bySayu Yagami. Instead of Ukita,Kanzo Mogiruns to the station to get the broadcast to stop, and Misa kills him with her Death Note. Witnessing Mogi's Death Note, Sayu becomes upset and calls her a ""murderer"", which causes Misa to freeze with a flashback to her murdered family, and she stops. When Light comes to the station for Sayu, Misa sees him on her way out, which is how she discovers his name. After confinement, it appears that she and Light share a room at headquarters, and she comments that it's like being married. At the end of the second film, her memories of the Death Note are still intact when Light dies, and she witnesses the final showdown between Light and L. Misa cries in anguish as she can do nothing but watch as Ryuk kills Light. Misa was likely taken into custody, but L burned the Death Notes and Misa lost her memories. Misa is not prosecuted and is eventually released. Unlike in the original series, Misa does not commit suicide following Light's death. Instead, she is seen wishing Light a happy birthday before a family shrine, which holds Light's picture and a picture of Misa's family. She feels that a part of her life is somehow missing, or that she has forgotten something important. However, she doesn't remember what it is. Misa in the fourth film The fourth film,Death Note: Light Up the NEW World, is set ten years later. Misa is a successful model and actress. Although nothing suspicious has happened with her, she remains under surveillance by the police.Yuki Shiengives her one of the Death Notes, and her memories of events come back to her. Shien meets her secretly in her car in the parking garage, where the cameras can't see them talk. Shien wants Misa's help, but she isn't interested. She tells him to take the Death Note, but he leaves it with her saying it's hers. Shien later texts Misa for help, and she arrives. She again makes the eye deal with Ryuk, and she writes downRyuzaki's name, apparently killing him. When Shien starts to get them out of there, Misa tells him to go on alone because she can't. She tells him the location he was looking for and she gives him her Death Note, and she stays behind. With scraps of Death Note paper, she kills Kuromoto and Uragami, members of the Task Force, to help Shien get away. Misa then goes outside, having written her own name and the circumstances of her death on a scrap of Death Note paper. As written, she dies on December 18th at 2:40 pm ""in the arms of Light Yagami."" It is also revealed in the fourth film that Light had a child who would be nine years old. The child was being raised byTeru Mikami, who was Misa's prosecutor after the Kira case. Although the child's mother isn't directly named, the age of the child and the connection between Misa and the child's guardian implies that Misa is the mother. Erika Toda said that, prior to filming, she felt ""a lot of pressure"" due to the character's popularity with audiences. She said the pressure vanished when filming began. Toda said that undoing the straight jacket took a lot of time, and at times she waited in the jacket between takes. Toda also said that on one occasion, she wore a blindfold for an hour during filming. Erika Toda said that she views Misa as ""complicated and fascinating."" Toda added that she does not comprehend why a person would willingly use a Death Note; Toda said that she admired the fact that Misa ""does everything she sets out to do"" and that the actions of Light and Misa are ""criminal."""
Who does Misa take along to one of Misa's concerts?,Sayu,Musical,"Jeong Sun Ah as Misa duringReady to Love Misa is a popular singer in the Musical. Just as in canon, she's grateful to Kira and wants to meet him, and she trades for the Shinigami eyes to do so. Unlike in other versions, Misa isn't shown killing anyone, leaving it unclear if she actually uses her Death Note. Sayu is a fan of Misa, and she takes Light along to one of Misa's concerts, during which Misa openly supports and gives thanks to Kira. When Misa encounters Rem, she insists on finding Kira, so Rem reluctantly offers her the eye deal, which Misa accepts. Misa comes up with a song with a secret message to Kira, which Sayu shares with Light. Misa also sends tapes to a TV station as the Second Kira. From the song and tapes, Light gets her message and they're able to secretly meet. Misa suggests they date, and Light agrees, but he gets her to give him the name of the man following him, which Misa does despite her reluctance. Misa later goes to visit Light on campus where she meets L and sees his name, but L has her apprehended immediately after. After several days in confinement, she gives up her ownership of the notebook and loses her memories.

What did Ohba want another character to use to trade for the Shinigami Eyes?,Misa,Overview,"Tsugumi Ohba, writer ofDeath Note, decided to create Misa to be the second Kira before the serialization began. They felt that having the story solely consist of males would be ""boring"" and that they wanted ""a cute female."" Ohba, intending to introduce Misa with the Shinigami Eyes, described her as having to be ""spontaneous and not too bright"" and that they determined her personality ""from the start."" Since Light Yagami would never want to trade for the Shinigami Eyes, Ohba wanted another character to use to trade for the eyes, so they decided to use Misa. Ohba said that the conception of the name Misa ""was kind of random but I think it was from ""kuromisa"" ."

He,(A).,Character,"Near is very intelligent, although his childish appearance and demeanor can cause others, such asDavid Hoope, to question his abilities. He has an obsession with solving complex problems and views an investigation as solving a puzzle. He is highly observational and was once seen piecing together a puzzle that was almost entirely colored white. He is proficient when it comes to multitasking and is able to monitor multiple computer screens at once. Near also appears to be ambidextrous, playing darts with his left hand and stacking dice with his right. Despite his genius abilities, Near has low social knowledge and is bad at interacting with others. As stated inDeath Note 13: How to Read, ""he is only able to display his true deductive powers when he has the support of his members."" The book also states that Near is distant from people because he is sensitive. Near is rather codependent, as seen when he asksResterto accompany him on his flight to Japan due to having never flown alone. Near as the SPK members die Near is very calm and stable, a trait that is described inDeath Note 13: How to Readas potentially being ""above that of L's."" He is also rather devious and isn't above using tactics that are ""barely within the law,"" as he ""values results above all else."" Although a seemingly straight-faced individual, Near will often smirk when getting something right and does so many times while trying to corner Light during their conversations. He is also shown to have a sense of humor, such as when he stated that Light was ""popular with the ladies"" while discussing with Rester the roles ofMisa AmaneandKiyomi Takadain the Kira case. Near plays with toys in SPK headquarters Near shows much more emotion and displays far more facial expressions in the manga than he does in the anime. For example, when theSPKmembers were killed around him in the anime, Near keeps a stern look, but he is visibly upset in the manga. Tsugumi Ohba, the writer ofDeath Note, said that Near becomes less likable as the story progresses, citing the upcoming plan to have the notebook at a later point in history. Ohba added that Near's cheeky behavior, intended to reinforce his childishness, had been construed as annoying. The author said that a negative reaction led to a difference in their attitudes and that people may have seen Near as a cheat or wannabe L. In the post-series one-shot chapter, Near is shown to have great respect for L, basing much of how he solves crime on L's methods, even to the point where he only takes cases that he has a personal interest in rather than trying to pursue justice. Much like L, Near shows various unusual mannerisms during his day-to-day life. He is usually seen hunched over rather than sitting, and he also constantly plays with various toys, which he uses in his theories. Near's 'L' shaped tarot card towers With extremely childlike interests, his surroundings always have toys, dice, or darts strewn about. Even though he is only playing, piecing together a patterned puzzle starting out of nowhere and the like easily shows a sample of his abilities and intelligence. Normally, his fixation with toys is light, but he does seem to have favorites, such as the toys he took with him when escaping the SPK headquarters while it was under attack byHitoshi Demegawaand other Kira supporters. Three years after the main story, Near takes an interest in building Tarot card stacks. Of course, these structures are far beyond normal size, easily covering an entire room. It appears that Near would despise anyone who knocks down these structures, accidentally or intentionally. He also seems to have a love for dice. Although Near is always surrounded by toys, few of them are electronic. Most of his toys are the types that need to be moved manually, such as his action figures, darts, and dolls. His electronic toys include his remote-control rubber ducks and a battery-powered train. However, despite his childish interests and activities, he seems to be the most mature in realistic compared to Light, L, and Mello, when it comes to his ideals, with a very pragmatic point of view on justice, being an existentialist. In the Never Complete One-shot, while Near is willing to go against Kira, he refuses to outright go against the American government, due to how Near himself lives in America, when America was able to purchase the Death Note. Though Near notes that it would have been hard for America to freely use the Death Note if the entire world knows that it is in possession of the American government. Near's insignia While L uses the Old English Text MT/Cloister Black font text ""L,"" Near uses the Wedding Text BT/ClerestorySSK font text ""N"" to represent himself during the Kira investigation. In the one-shot chapter, he is shown conducting investigations as ""L,"" and using the Old English Text MT/Cloister Black font text ""L."""
What does Roger tell the two boys that L has died?,his office,History,"Near is introduced to the story as a child at Wammy's House. He is first seen sitting alone in a room piecing together a white puzzle, with the puzzle's only design being a black letter 'L' in the corner. As some children run by the room, a young girl namedLindaasks Near if he wants to play with them. Near replies, ""No, thank you, Linda,"" and continues to put together his puzzle. Soon after,Roger Ruviecomes by the room withMelloand brings the two children to his office. There, Roger informs the two boys that L has died. Near works on a puzzle in Roger's office Although Mello reacts rather violently to the news, Near remains quiet, sitting on the floor piecing together his puzzle. Mello begins questioning Roger, asking how L could say that he would catch Kira but end up dead himself. Near picks up his completed puzzle and turns it upside down, causing the pieces to fall about. He states, ""If you can't win the game, if you can't solve the puzzle, you are just a loser."" He immediately begins putting his puzzle back together. Mello asks Roger if he or Near was chosen as L's successor, and Roger replies that L had not yet decided. Roger asks if the two boys could work together. Near responds with a positive ""alright,"" while Mello says it will never work because they ""don't get along."" Mello decides that Near should take the position of L because of his ability to stay calm and refrain from getting emotional, saying Near ""uses his head"" to solve the puzzle. Mello leaves the orphanage, and Near follows soon afterward. In the time between learning of L's death and the creation of the SPK, Near gathers evidence related to the Kira case. Because all of the data gathered by L had been deleted, Near starts from scratch."

The Director informs the President that the current 'L' is false and was created by the Japanese Police to avoid disorder. The President is informed that the murders performed by Kira were done with a Death Note. The Director asks Near if these statements are correct, and Near replies that they are. Near explains that on November 5, 2004, L pursuedHiguchi, and Higuchi was surrounded by police cars in his vehicle within forty minutes. Near says that L warned the police to not get near Higuchi's car, meaning that there is no doubt that Higuchi had the ability to kill. The President asks Near if he thinks Higuchi killed with a Death Note, and Near responds that the notebook has the power to kill those whose name is written in it. Near explains that a policeman at the scene reported hearing Higuchi mention a notebook that could kill someone whose face you know if you write their name in it. Near says that afterward, a notebook was removed from the scene and taken away via helicopter. Near says that this indicates that with L gone, the notebook is most likely in the hands of theJapanese Police. The Director tells the President that Near began his own investigation with no prior evidence, but his research material that he brought for the President support his theory. The President asks the Director who this boy is, and the Director responds that Near is the rightful successor to the name of 'L.' On March 12, 2009, the United States of America created theSpecial Provision for Kira, an independent organization consisting of FBI and CIA agents established to investigate Kira. Near worked for the United States as the head of the SPK. He sentJohn McEnroe, a member of the SPK, to talk with the director of theJapanese Task Force, which Near is suspicious of thanks to their incompetence,Soichiro Yagami. Through Soichiro's reaction, Near learned that Deputy DirectorTakimura, has been kidnapped. Near has McEnroe offer the Task Force cooperation from the SPK in order to find Takimura, with Near's strategy being that they can seize theDeath Notefor themselves. However, shortly after, Takimura committed suicide, and Near considers the possibility that Kira may have been responsible for Takimura's death. Near reveals his knowledge of L's death The kidnappers then kidnapSayu Yagami, the daughter of Soichiro, in exchange for the Death Note. The Task Force then decides they have no choice but to ask for Near's help in this situation. Over the phone, Near taunts thesecond Lby letting him know that Near is aware of the previous L's death. The Task Force informs Near of the situation, that the exchange will happen in Los Angeles. Near agrees to have satellite surveillance on the estimated area where the exchange will occur, then tells the second L that the Task Force will be in charge of the situation. At the site of the exchange, Near's satellite surveillance proved useless thanks to the fact that the exchange is taking place underground. Near sends a chopper in order to transport Soichiro back to where he originally was. He asks Soichiro several questions regarding the trade, and Soichiro talks about someone eating chocolate during the call, signifying to Near that Mello is behind this and that Mello his taunting him. During one of Near's conversations with the second L, Near taunts him and calls him incompetent. Near, thinking there may bea spywithin the SPK, plans on finding out who the spy is then getting to the mafia and Mello through the spy. However, just then, all but three SPK members drop dead, thanks to Mello, preventing any possibility of Near getting to the mafia. Near and the second L then agree to share information, Near tells the second L that Mello is behind the kidnappings and what Wammy's House is, while the second L tells Near everything the Task Force knows about the Death Note. Near deduces Kira's identity as the second L The Task Force eventually retrieves the notebook and defeats Mello. Thanks in part to this situation, Near deduces the second L is, in fact, Kira. Because of these events, however, the president of the United States submits to Kira and dissolves the SPK as an official organization. Near speculates that the reason Mello left a few members of the SPK alive is to gain information from them in order to catch Kira. Near plans on following Mello's plan in order to see what he does next, so Near hasHalle Lidnerpass on information to him, particularly regarding the second L being Kira as well as Mello's photo being with Near. Near has bugging devices be placed on Halle, forcing Halle, who was already passing on information to Mello, to share information to Mello solely in the shower. Mello confronts Near Mello enters the SPK headquarters, asking Near for his photo. When Near told Mello that he managed to deduce who Kira is thanks to Mello's actions, out of rage, he threatens to shoot Near, only for Halle to convince him from doing it. In return for the photo, Mello tells Near that there are fake rules in the Death Note. Near deduces that one of these rules is the 13-day rule. He contacts the Task Force, and discusses this fake rule. During his conversation with the second L, Near's suspicion of the second L increases. He tells this to the Task Force, arousing doubt within them. Mello then givesMogito Near and tells Near to demand information out of Mogi, with Mello listening in on the conversation. However, Mogi, thinking that Near and Mello are working together, doesn't spill any information. Soon after, a large crowd of Kira supporters were sent to attack the SPK. Near manages to use L's inheritance to distract them, then escape wearing police officer uniforms. Near then lies to the Task Force, telling them that Mogi has died of a heart attack, making it look worse for the second L. After this,Aizawatells Near information about the Kira case, allowing Near to deduce that Kira is, in fact,Light Yagami. Sometime later, whenKiyomi Takadagets elected for Kira's new spokesperson, Near hasAnthony Resterkeep watch of Takada, and finds out she is having meetings with someone. After the SPK moves to Japan, Near has Halle become one of Takada's bodyguards in order to investigate her. Near and Light converse once again, and they inform each other of their respective investigations of Takada. This has Near believe that Light Yagami is having meetings with Takada in order to communicate with Kira's proxy, X-Kira. At this point, Near formulates the plan to take down Kira, which is swapping his notebook with a fake then catching him in the act of writing down the names. Near confirms thatTeru Mikamiis X-Kira Later on, Near identifiesTeru Mikamias Light's proxy. For the next few months, he hadGevannispy on Mikami, only for him to deceive the SPK by saying things such as the fact that he has aShinigamifollowing him. Near holds Mogi and Misa in custody in order to remove any unnecessary things that may interfere with Near's plan of exposing Light as Kira. On December 31st, when Mikami goes to the gym, Near swaps the pages of the notebook corresponding with the 28th of January and onward, not aware of the fact that he's only swapped the pages of a duplicate notebook that Mikami forged under Light's orders. In order to ensure that Gevanni is not being controlled by a potential third Kira or a Shinigami, Near waits 23 days, that being the maximum amount of time the notebook can control someone for. Near calls the Task Force and asks them to meet him at theYellow Box Warehousein order to enact his final plan of exposing Light as Kira. Shortly after, Mello kidnapsKiyomi Takada, resulting in Mello's death. Mikami then proceeds to write Takada's name using the real notebook. This action results in Gevanni finding the real notebook, then switching it with an exact replica. However, Near makes no changes to his plans for the meeting. Near says that together, he and Mello can surpass L The meeting commences, and, just as Near plans, Mikami attempts to write down the names of everyone. Light thinks that he won as he had actually had a fake. However, thanks to Mello's actions, Near's plan worked. Since everyone except Light's name was written, Light is exposed as Kira. Near explains the entire situation and how Mello aided him before declaring that he and Mello, together, were capable of surpassing L. In a desperate attempt to regain control of the situation, Light confesses and has a speech about how beneficial Kira is to the world, but Near refutes this by stating that morality is subjective and Kira, killing people and forcing them to follow one path, is unjust in the eyes of many. After Light tries to kill Near using a snippet he has,Touta Matsuda, enraged, shoots him, before he dies at the hands ofRyuk. Following Light's defeat, Near becomes the thirdL. During the epilogue of the manga, Matsuda proposes a theory that Near had used the Death Note on Mikami, which would assure his victory. Whether this theory is true or not is up to the reader's interpretation. In theone-shot chaptertaking place after the series, Near is shown as the new L . A new Kira emerges who has gained a Death Note from theShinigaminamedMidora, who had received the additional Death Note from theShinigami Kingby bribing him with 13 apples she had taken from theHuman World. The new Kira murdered elderly people in Japan to ""relieve their pain."" When Near's SPK subordinates asked him why he was not taking action, he replied that he was trying to think what the previous L would have done. He finally reaches the conclusion that the prevailing Kira was just a killer without a purpose, and he labeled the killer ""C-Kira"" for ""Cheap Kira."" He announces on national television, under the alias ""L,"" that he is not interested in the case and has deduced that this Kira is not the real Kira but only an ""abominable murderer."" This results in C-Kira's suicide. In theThe a-Kira Story, Near has grown out his hair and looks older. AfterMinoru Tanakaputs out a message onSakura TVattempting to sell his death note, Near is seen creating a Shinigami identification system. He has created a model of Ryuk's head and torso. Based on the fact that a Shinigami cannot be too far away from its owner, Near theorises that A-Kira is located in Japan. He instructs Lidner and Rester to contact Aizawa and get him to send over the security camera footage from Sakura TV. After Aizawa responds and informs them that the Shinigami fled from the building underground, Near decides that making a Shinigami recognition system is pointless and promptly destroys the Ryuk model. Near decides it is impossible to catch A-Kira, at least until the auction is over. After Matsuda attempts to stop Ryuk's second message, Near comments that all he did was make the auction seem more believable. After the price to be paid for the notebook is determined, Near enters into a mind palace like state as he stacks blocks. He theorises that A-Kira has already thought out a foolproof plan on how to receive the money. When it is revealed that theUnited States Presidenthas purchased the notebook, he is reluctant to attempt to seize it. As he puts it to Lidner and Rester ""If you're going to do it, do it on your own, please. I live in America now."" For the first time since he became L after the defeat of Kira, Near admits defeat at the hands of A-Kira."
What is the name of the character that Near is the natural successor to?,L,Conception,"The following information is fromDeath Note 13: How to Read. Tsugumi Ohba: Writer Takeshi Obata: Artist Ohba said that he gave Near a hobby of playing with toys ; he also stacks ""things"" as a development from L's hobby of stacking sugar cubes, emphasizing his childlike appearance. The given name ""Nate"" comes from the word ""natural,"" and ""River"" symbolizes that Near's talents flow from L. Therefore, Near is the natural successor to L. The name is ""supposed"" to show that Near is a ""natural genius blessed from above."" The nickname Near is composed of the first and last letters ofNate Riverthen swapped around to make a recognizable word. Ohba said that he let Obata create the character designs and asked him to make both characters look ""a little 'L-ish.'"" Obata said that since Ohba wanted to ""include a little L"" in Near and Mello, he tried to keep ""the weirdness and the panda eyes."" Near's preferred posture Obata added that the designs for the characters became switched at the design phase; the final Mello had Near's design and vice-versa. Obata said that when he created a depiction of the designs, his editor wrote the wrong names accompanying the designs. When Obata received approval, he could not say that the labels were incorrect. Obata said that, for him, Near was ""more evil"" than Mello. He feels now that ""it's better"" that the switch occurred. Obata said that when he first saw Near, he ""didn't even know what the heck he was wearing."" He said that ""it was tough"" drawing Near's apparel as he did not understand the assembly of his clothes. Obata said that when he settled for pajamas, because of the ""toyish"" theme Near represents, ""things got a lot easier."" The artist stated that as he drew Near, the concept of his immaturity became ""stronger and stronger,"" as he believes that such traits are best revealed ""gradually."" Obata cited the fact that in the beginning, Near's sole toy consisted of darts. Ohba has said that the finger puppets used by Near in the final chapter did not exist in the thumbnails and that he felt the final scenes ""looked cooler"" with the presence of the puppets. Obata said that he felt he could express the ""negative"" parts of Near with the puppets. Ohba added that one could see ""his dark side in his kind of puppets he used."" Obata said that Near first brought the finger puppets and drew on them with a magic marker; he then said Near must have created the other puppets afterwards. Although Near respects L, Obata sees Near not liking L as a person, as Near says, ""If you can't win the game, if you can't solve the puzzle, then you're just a loser."" Since he refers to L as a loser, Obata had Near depict L as ugly; however, Near worked hard on Mello's puppet, as Near liked Mello. When asked: ""Who do you think is the smartest character [inDeath Note]?"" Obata replied, ""Near. Because he cheats."""

Mello verges on immorality in his obsession with being the one to take down Kira and is willing to do ""whatever it takes,"" including kidnappingSayu Yagami, the Japanese Police Director's daughter, and orchestrating the murders of most of theSPKmembers. In the manga, after Mello has successfully stolen a Death Note, he even goes so far as to attempt to blackmail the president of the United States into giving him funds and resources to aid his pursuit of Kira and to evade Near, threatening that if his demands are not met he will use the Death Note to force the president to launch the United States' nuclear missiles and start World War III. Arguably, Mello is not trying to defeat Kira out of a sense of ""justice"" but because capturing Kira will prove to the world that Mello is indeed the worthy successor to L as the world's greatest detective and not simply a runner-up to Near.

The artist ofDeath Note,Takeshi Obata, points out inDeath Note 13: How to Readthat Mello's envy and hatred of Near is only one-sided and that Near ""honestly liked Mello."" The book states that Mello is not purely evil, citing his genuine care forMatt's well-being and his apology for Matt's death, as well as his apology toSoichiro Yagamifor his responsibility for Soichiro's fatal wounds. The book also states that Mello has an excellent mind and that he sometimes lets his emotions get in his way.Tsugumi Ohba, the writer ofDeath Note, has stated that Mello works hard for everything, unlike Near, whose intellectual gifts are natural. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, Mello is seen eating only bars of chocolate, even when talking. In the manga, he is seen licking the chocolate before eating it. Mello also has a habit of bending his right leg up while sitting, often with his left leg turned outwards. He tends to alternate between that pose and simply crossing his right leg over his left leg. Another trait of his that is comparable to L is his tendency to take drastic strategies to confuse and force the hand of his opponents, as well as his lust for victory and the need to satisfy his ego."
Where does Mello join forces with Rod Ross?,America,History,"Mello and Near learn of L's death Mello is first introduced to the story as a young teenager at Wammy's House. He is shown playing outside with some other children , while Near stays indoors alone, working on a blank puzzle. When the children go back indoors, Mello can be seen holding a smaller boy back. The manager,Roger Ruvie, then asks him and Near to join him in his office, where he tells them of L's death. Mello is shocked and angered by the news. He is told that L failed to choose either him or Near as a successor. Roger tries to persuade them to work together, but while Near is willing, Mello refuses, pointing out that they never get on and that in terms of knowledge and ability, Near is always ahead of him no matter how hard he tries. Calmly and methodically, Mello himself states that Near should be the successor, and he soon after runs away from Wammy's House, determined to find Kira his own way. Sometime after leaving the orphanage, Mello goes to America, where, three years after running away, he joins forces withRod Ross, a leading Mafiosi. He proves his worth by destroying mob bosses whom even Kira could not identify, and his advice proves invaluable to Ross, who is persuaded to help Mello claim the Death Note."
What is the name of the member of the Mafia that Mello has a member of the Mafia write down the names of almost every member of the SPK?,Ill Ratt,Plot,"Nearly four years after L's death, Mello learns about theDeath NotefromIll Ratt, a member of the newly formedSPKwhich, under Near's leadership, has begun its own search for Kira. Ratt keeps Mello informed of the SPK's plans. At first, Mello gets the Mafia to kidnapKanichi Takimura, the Director of the JapaneseNPA, in order to exchange him for the Death Note, which is in the possession of theJapanese Task Force. When Takimura is killed, an action Mello recognizes as one of Kira's possible murders, Mello realizes that Kira potentially has access to police information. To increase pressure on the Task Force, Mello kidnapsSayu Yagami, daughter of NPA Deputy DirectorSoichiro Yagami. He then forces Soichiro to come to the USA and hand over the Death Note, which is placed in a missile that cannot be tracked by radar. The missile crashes into the ocean, and the Mafia are able to obtain the Death Note before the authorities can trace it. During these events, Mello communicates with Soichiro while eating chocolate, a fact that is passed on to Near—Mello's intention being to show his rival that he has beaten him and obtained the Death Note first. Shortly after, Mello has a member of the Mafia write down the names of almost every member of the SPK, not only to severely hinder Near's investigation and reduce the number of his resources, but also to kill the spy within the SPK should Near plan on getting to Mello through the spy. Mello again contacts Soichiro and threatens to use the Death Note to kill him and Sayu unless he passes on information, such as the real name of the current L, who is Soichiro's sonLight Yagami. TheKira Task Forcemanages to gain a reprieve by telling Mello that the new L isTouta Matsudabut that he just acts on the instructions of the other members and is not the real brains of their operation. Mello sees the Task Force as next to useless because of how little progress they have made since L's death and, recognizing that Matsuda is indeed not the person issuing orders, does not kill him. Mello contacts American PresidentDavid Hoopeand blackmails him into granting Mello access to satellite surveillance, weapons, funds, and information on the SPK. After learning the SPK has narrowed his hideout to four locations, Mello moves. Meanwhile, the ShinigamiSidoh, who is the original owner of theDeath NoteMello now possesses, also finds out Mello's location and is able to get there first. Appearing before the Mafiosi, the monstrous Sidoh causes them to panic in horror. Only Mello stays calm and his cool attitude and hard stare unnerves even the Shinigami. Mello bargains with Sidoh, instructing him to guard the hideout in case of an attack by the SPK. Sidoh reveals to Mello that two rules in the Death Note — including the one stating that the user dies unless he kills someone every thirteen days — are fake. Mello begins to theorize that Kira probably used that rule to fool the Japanese police into thinking he was innocent . With knowledge ofShinigami Eyes, Mello forcesJack Neyloninto making theeye dealwith Sidoh. In time, Light discovers the location of Mello's Mafia hideout by havingMisa Amaneuse herShinigami Eyesto identify Neylon, a Mafia member who currently owns the Death Note. Light usesanother Death Noteto make Neylon mail him the Mafia's location. Soichiro Yagami views Mello's real name, Mihael Keehl, and lifespan. Light sends a US Army Special Forces team led byYitzak Ghazaninto raid the Mafia hideout, but it is foiled when Sidoh helps Mello and his accomplices escape and all the US Army Special Forces team are killed except one, who later commits suicide after biting down on a cyanide pill hidden in his tooth. The Mafia is tracked down again, however, and this time raided by theKira Task Forceled bySoichiro Yagami, who currently possesses Shinigami Eyes after making the eye deal withRyuk. As the raid commences, all but two of the Mafia members die, which leads Mello to suspecting that Kira is behind the attack. He has the remaining two gangsters guard the notebook. However, the Task Force manage to capture them and regain the notebook. Mello reveals to the Task Force that he has the entire hideout rigged with explosive, which allows him to demand that the Task Force destroy the cameras on their helmets, drop their weapons, and have one of its members enter the room Mello is in while bringing a mask and the notebook, which leads to a tense showdown between Soichiro and Mello. Although he has a Death Note and can see Mello's real name, Soichiro, a principled man and upstanding law officer, gives his enemy every opportunity to surrender, only to be shot at and fatally injured by another Mafiosi who was later shot byTouta Matsuda.Shuichi Aizawaholds Mello at gunpoint, again demanding that he surrender, but Mello detonates the bombs, survives the explosion, and escapes. He is left badly scarred along the left side of his face above his mouth; the gas mask he was wearing at the time protected the rest of his face. Mello makes his way to New York where he hides out in the home ofHalle Lidner, an SPK member, who keeps him up to date with Near's latest theories concerning the Kira case. Lidner wants Kira captured and appears to believe that Mello and Near are both needed for this to happen, even if they fail to work together. Near and Mello are briefly reunited at the SPK HQ Mello later forces his way into the SPK HQ while holding Lidner at gunpoint, intending to retrieve the one existing photograph of himself from Near. When Near states that Mello has actually been a big help in his own investigation, Mello becomes enraged and turns his gun on Near, saying that he isn't a tool Near can use to solve a puzzle. Near is unfazed by being held at gunpoint and even goes so far as encouraging Mello to shoot him. Seriously tempted, Mello is talked into lowering his weapon by Lidner, who steps in front of the gun and warns him that shooting Near will only result in him being killed by the other SPK members, leaving Kira victorious since he would be rid of the only persons capable of matching him and bringing him down. Mello receives his childhood photo from Near, which has ""Dear Mello"" written on the back Near gives Mello the photograph. In return, Mello tells him about the Shinigami and thefake Death Note rules. As Mello leaves, each wryly promises the other that the race is on to see who finds Kira first. This meeting between the two successors has a profound impact, as the information Near receives from Mello drastically sharpens Near's suspicion of Light Yagami. Mello luresKanzo Mogiof the Japanese Task Force to New York and into the hands of Near and the SPK. Thinking that Near and Mello are actually in league with each other, Mogi refuses to talk, but Near and Mello's subsequent conversation over the phone and other events lead Mogi and Aizawa to suspect that Light Yagami may be Kira after all, though they hesitate, since it is based on trusting Mello, a sworn enemy, and his claims about the fake rules. Aizawa eventually meets Near and reveals more information regarding the Death Note. Near gets Lidner to pass this info on to Mello, except for the fact that he has now identified Light Yagami as the new L and the prime suspect for Kira. Mello has now been joined byMatt, another boy from Wammy's House. They follow Aizawa and Mogi back to Los Angeles and this leads them to spying on Misa Amane and the Task Force HQ. Based on the information passed on by Lidner, Mello guesses that Misa is theSecond Kira, though she strikes him as so feather-brained that it is hard to believe Kira ever willingly employed her. However, he also concludes for himself that her boyfriend, Light Yagami, is L. Misa and the Task Force return to Japan where the police detectives intend to investigateKiyomi Takada, a TV presenter who has been made Kira's new spokesperson. Mello and Matt follow them and continue to track Misa and Mogi. Mello had originally planned to take the Death Note from Misa but decides not to, concluding that she is not the Second Kira anymore. Lidner informs Mello of Near's plan to expose and capture Kira. Timing is essential, and there are only a few days to go before the plan is implemented. Mello kidnapsKiyomi Takadaby having Matt attack Takada's motorcade with a gas grenade. Mello drives up on a motorbike and offers to take Takada to safety. In the confusion, and with reassurance from Lidner, Takada agrees, not realizing it is Mello until it is too late to get off. After a chase, Mello is able to evade Takada's guards and locks her in a shipping truck. While driving her to a different location, Mello sees on his portable television that Matt was cornered by Takada's guards and killed in a hail of gunfire – something he had not expected and regrets. Mello faces off with Takada before his death. Mello forces Takada to strip in order to get rid of any tracking devices; however, he allows her to cover herself with a blanket. This proves to be his undoing, as she has a piece of Mikami's Death Note hidden in her clothes and the blanket allows her to hide it. Since she knows Mello's real name from Light, Takada uses the hidden piece of the Death Note to kill him."
"Why did Ohba give Mello a ""very plain"" death? A: He wanted Mello to be the character who ultimately defeats Light. B: He wanted Mello to be the character who ultimately defeats Light. C: He wanted Mello to be the character who ultimately defeats Light. D: He wanted Mello to be the character who ultimately defeats Light.",D,Overview,"Ohba said that he introducedNearand Mello together becauseLindividually could not defeat Kira. He felt that introducing one character individually would produce a ""repeat"" of the struggle betweenLightand L, so he instead wanted a story involving three combatants fighting each other. At first, he ""wavered"" in their ages and considered making the characters the younger version of L, and he did not develop their personalities initially as he wanted to ""reveal"" them through their actions. Ohba gave Mello the chocolate trait because he believed that chocolate ""represented all sweets"" and that it would fit with the story arc in the United States. He described the trait as ""useful"" during the discovery of Mello's base due to the discarded chocolate boxes. Ohba also said that he added Mello's scar to the thumbnails as this appearance would give him ""more depth."" These traits give Mello a unique character build. The writer recalled that he considered having Mello be the character who ultimately defeats Light. According to Ohba, after the disappearance of Sidoh, he ""struggled"" with Mello's role. Ohba's idea of Mello ultimately defeating Light and Near - being ""the best"" - was strong in his mind, but once Mello had ""learned too much about the Death Note"" he had to kill him to ""sustain the intensity of the story."" As a result, Ohba did not give Mello a ""large role"" at the conclusion ofDeath Noteand instead had Mello negatively affect Light ""indirectly."" Ohba gave Mello a ""very plain"" death, depicted in only one panel; he felt that if Mello had perished ""dramatically"" it would reveal the truth behind his death."
How did Obata feel when he created the character designs?,a major struggle,Character design,"Ohba said that he let Obata create the character designs and asked him to make both characters look ""a little 'L-ish.'"" Mello with his posture similar to L's, and like L, he isn't wearing shoes. Obata said that, since Ohba wanted to ""include a little L"" in Near and Mello, he tried to keep ""the weirdness and the panda eyes."" He also added that since L was an important character, he felt that he made Near and Mello look too much like L and described the character designs as ""a major struggle."" Obata said that, when he first heard about Near and Mello, he assumed that Near and Mello would join as a team and work together, so he envisioned the two as twins when he created the character designs. The artist added that the designs for the characters became switched at the design phase; the final Mello had Near's design and vice versa. Obata said that when he created a depiction of the designs, his editor wrote the wrong names accompanying the designs; when Obata received approval he could not say that the labels were incorrect. Obata said that, for him, Mello's design was ""more calm and feminine,"" while Near's was more chaotic with his tangled hair. However, he came to feel that it was better that the switch happened. Obata added that he designed Mello's clothing based on ""what I like,"" meaning clothes he enjoys drawing and not clothes that he enjoys wearing; Obata has stated that he enjoys drawing ""shiny"" leather. At first, Obata tried to depict Mello as having ""more energy than Near."" Mello's hair was originally cut straight across, but Obata preferred Mello's hair becoming messy, which occurred later in the story. The artist said that he felt grateful when Ohba added the scar, since he felt that he could draw Mello ""looking cooler."" In additionDeath Note 13: How to Readdescribed Mello as looking ""more intense"" and ""more human"" with the scar. Obata claimed he felt sad when Mello died in the story shortly afterward. At the point he created the pages featuring the reappearance of Mello with his scar, the artist ""finally [felt that he could draw Mello] really well."" He added that the fact that he and Ohba did not regularly meet in person was for the best, because if Obata told Ohba about his satisfaction with Mello's new appearance, Ohba may not have killed Mello."

C.C. dressed as an Ashford student In the first season, C.C. primarily wears the outfit she initially appears in - a white straitjacket used to restrain her during her time as a test subject for the Britannian Empire, prior to the beginning of the series. These suits contain many means of restraint, including various straps and zippers, and a high collar capable of gagging the wearer. Not set to fully bind the wearer, the suits have rather long sleeves that flare outwards closer to the cuffs. A number of these straitjackets are seen in the Geass research laboratories. According to theAudio Drama, the reason for C.C.'s common use of the suit is because she feels she is not free. She is seen wearing it through most of the first season and the end of the second season. The scar on C.C.'s body that resembles the Geass sigil.

Who does C.C. take the opportunity to escape?,Lelouch,First season,"C.C. as she is released from the capsule. C.C. makes her first appearance at the beginning of the first episode of the series, watching a ten-year-oldLelouchand a ten-year-oldSuzakuobserving theBritannian Militaryas they enterJapan. C.C. is introduced whenNagataopens the capsule that supposedly contains poison. Suzaku quickly puts his own gas mask on Lelouch's face, but to their surprise, a restrained green-haired woman, C.C., emerges out of the capsule. Before they can get answers, Suzaku's superiors come and tell him not to question his briefing, and to shoot the ""terrorist"", Lelouch. When he refuses, he is promptly shot in the back. Lelouch and C.C. take the opportunity to escape. Just as they seem to have evaded detection, Lelouch's phone rings, giving him away. As they're about to kill him, C.C. jumps in front and is shot in the forehead. A desperate Lelouch now thinks of his impending death. He is grabbed by the hand by C.C., who proposes a contract that would allow him to live and endow him withGeass, the power of kings. She then supposedly dies. She unexpectedly reappears in the fifth episode, casually folding origami withNunnally. From this point on she passively oversees Lelouch's missions as Zero, wanting to keep him alive so he can fulfill his contract. Unknown to Lelouch,Corneliasets a trap forZeroat theSaitama Ghettoby simulating the conditions in Shinjuku Ghetto. Despite C.C.'s warnings, Lelouch takes the bait and goes to the aid of the Saitama resistance. In order to save Lelouch, C.C. dons his Zero costume and distracts theBritannian Army, allowing him to escape. Lelouch blames his defeat on the undisciplined rebels and tells her that he will resolve to build something far better than a mere resistance unit, first an army, then ""people,"" and finally a nation. C.C. was called toClovislandby Mao, at first she was stopped by Lelouch. She tells him that she will go back to Mao. Lelouch asks if she is betraying him, which C.C. responds that she was never his friend, just a collaborator. He continues saying that she knows too much about him. He commands C.C. to stay by his side and not leave by using his Geass power but it fails due to C.C.'s immortality and code. She promises him that she will not reveal anything about his identity and tells Lelouch that when she's gone, all his obstacles will disappear too. Not wanting to let her leave, Lelouch goes to Clovisland and uses a recording to distract and make Mao fired up when he hears that C.C. is Lelouch's partner. Lelouch uses his Geass power on the police to shoot Mao, allowing Lelouch to rescue her. After she is out of harm's way he then makes a contract with C.C., promising he will grant both his own and C.C.'s wishes to fulfill the contract that Mao failed to. C.C. gladly accepts this through a handshake. When C.C.'s existence is revealed to theBlack Knights, she gains considerable unofficial standing, as she is seen by other members to be one of Zero's closest advisers. However, her willful attitude and lack of an official posting annoy some veteran members and cause confusion as to her role within the Black Knights. At one point, Tamaki goes so far as to falsely accuse her of being Zero's mistress. When the Black Knights gain possession of theKnightmare FrameGawain, she becomes its pilot while Lelouch operates the weapons. C.C. plummets Jeremiah along with herself into the ocean.

What was the Geass symbol in C.C.'s left eye?,Geass,Geass (formerly),"C.C.'s Geass Before becoming immortal, C.C.'s Geass, as contracted with a nun during apparently medieval times, granted her the power ""to be loved,"" which allowed her to make anyone around her love her. She originally started with a Geass symbol in her left eye, but as she matured, she eventually developed another in her right, implying that she became unable to control it, causing everyone to love her. After C.C. had become bored by the tranced society around her, the nun who had bound the Geass contract to her revealed she had tricked C.C., severely injuring her. C.C.'s only option to survive was to accept the nun's Code and its immortality. Losing the Code, the nun became mortal again, allowing her to commit suicide, and, as part of the exchange, C.C. became immune to the effects of Geass while losing her own Geass. Her Geass sigil/mark is located on her forehead, glowing red when activated."
Where did Suzaku meet C.C.?,Kamine Island,Suzaku kururugi,"At first, Suzaku and C.C. had few major encounters. At the end of theBattle of Narita, C.C. used her power to telepathically shock Suzaku's mind, causing him to remember abouthis fatherand subconscious death wish. It's implied that she had some respect for Suzaku's skill as a warrior, while noting his reckless nature at the same time. Following theSecond Battle of Tokyo, C.C. and Suzaku finally met face-to-face atKamine Island. Suzaku was one of the few people that C.C. showed genuine sympathy towards. She sympathized and related to his death wish and inability to die, having a death wish of her own and being incapable of death due to her immortality. Suzaku, due to her mental attack on him, called C.C. irresponsible, causing her to tease him by asking him if he enjoyed having others look into his thoughts. When C.C. revealed how she was using Lelouch, Suzaku asked if she had any regrets. C.C. immediately said that she didn’t, claiming that she had abandoned her humanity. Upon hearing this, Suzaku claimed that he and C.C. weren’t as alike as she thought before asking her to allow him into C’s World. Following the foiling of the Ragnarök Connection, over the course of a month in C's World and before their return to Earth, C.C. formed an alliance alongside Lelouch and Suzaku to complete the Zero Requiem. During the execution of the plan, C.C. appeared to show genuine respect and even some deference towards Suzaku due to their alliance. When Suzaku called himself and C.C. Lelouch's ""sword"" and ""shield"" respectively, C.C. seemed to accept this assessment, telling him ""We do things as you like."" At the same time, C.C. appeared to briefly question herself when Suzaku called Lelouch her ""accomplice""."
How did Kallen feel about C.C.?,selfish and secretive,Kallen kōzuki,"During her time in acting as part of the Black Knights, due to her unofficial high status, C.C. came to spend a significant amount of time with Kallen. Following Kallen's discovery of Lelouch's identity as Zero, she became one of the few people that C.C. revealed her status as an ""immortal witch"" to. Due to their headstrong attitudes, as well as C.C.'s selfish and secretive nature, the two did not have an easy connection. While the two of them never seemed to establish a full-fledged friendship, they appeared to have genuine respect towards one another and were able to work well together as allies within the Black Knights. During theBattle over the Pacific, C.C. silently urged Kallen to survive and rescue Lelouch. C.C.'s playful side also emerged around Kallen as well, with the two of them giving light teases and snark to one another at times, similar to her time with Lelouch. Kallen even gave her the nickname ""Pizza Girl"", to tease the immortal over her love of pizza, which C.C. didn't seem to mind at all. On a more serious level, C.C. openly shows respect towards Kallen's strength and ferocity in battle, as well as her focus on her convictions. During theBattle of Mt. Fuji, Kallen criticized C.C., claiming that she had no reason to fight. C.C. countered that she did, in the form of a promise to Lelouch. When C.C. admitted that she felt it was time for her to start truly living again, Kallen appeared to acknowledge this, claiming that she almost sounded ""human"" now. When C.C. is defeated by Kallen, she takes the time to congratulate her on her strength and victory. Kallen dismissed this, saying that it didn't matter to her before merely saying goodbye to her, implying that Kallen felt no real disdain towards C.C., even after things had gone so awry. As Kallen left her, C.C. gave a genuine smile, recognizing how Kallen had reawakened in her feelings of ""winning or losing"", implying that she felt genuine gratitude towards Kallen for this. After meeting again inZilkhstan, their relationship was seen to have improved as they helped each other outwit their pursuers, but it got worse for a moment when Kallen became angry upon realizing that C.C. was responsible for Lelouch's sorry state by reviving him, and her anger increased when she discovered thatC.C.revived him in order to make Lelouch fulfill the promise he made to the point of threatening C.C. with a knife, calling her selfish, only to be stopped by anLelouch. But their relationship improved again when Kallen calmed down and apologized to C.C. for what she did. When they arrived at theThought ElevatorKallen had already regained her trust in C.C. as she entrusted Lelouch knowing that she would finally complete her resurrection. And at the party before the battle Kallen showed her maturity by encouraging C.C. to tell her feelings to Lelouch knowing that being with Lelouch would make C.C. happy and when C.C. wanted to leave Kallen asked her if she could stay, something that C.C. denied."

What happened to Lelouch as a child?,he was exiled to Japan as a political hostage,Character outline,"Lelouch as a child, when he was 11th prince of Britannia. Lelouch was born on December 5, 1999 a.t.b. as Lelouch vi Britannia the son of the Emperor of Britannia,Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial ConsortMarianne, making Lelouch the Eleventh Prince of theHoly Britannian Empire. He was in line to be the seventeenth heir to the throne prior to his mother's assassination and his sister's crippling in the same incident. A ten-year-old Lelouch confronted the Emperor afterwards and accused him of leaving his mother defenseless, even going as far as renouncing his entitlement to the throne. In response, his father banished him to Japan, where he was used as a political hostage in the Sakuradite conflict. Lelouch as a child, when he was exiled to Japan as a political hostage. It was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first metSuzaku Kururugi, with whom the young Lelouch did not interact initially in a friendly way, before later becoming friends. However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch's use as a diplomatic tool, Lelouch, fearing for his and his sister's safety, hid their true identities and sought the help of the Ashford family, who were his mother's allies. His mother's death and his father's apparent lack of concern in regards to it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and made it his goal to pursue a better world forNunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all."
What is Lelouch's sister's name?,Nunnally,Nunnally vi britannia,"—Lelouch's main motivation for the Rebellion His younger sister Nunnally was the reason Lelouch began his quest to overthrow the Britannian Empire, and for most of the series creating a world she can live peacefully in is his driving motivation. Lelouch loves his sister over all others and her safety and comfort were always his number one priority to the point of him abandoning his allies to save her when she was captured. He once lost his intention to live after thinking Nunnally was dead. Despite his love for her Lelouch was willing to do whatever it took to bring peace to the world, even to the point of using his Geass on her and having her hate him in order to bring the Zero requiem to fruition. The Zero Requiem was actually planned by Lelouch to have him killed by Suzaku disguised as Zero to end the cycle of hatred and to bring peace to the world. Part of the reason Lelouch sacrificed himself was for the dream of Nunnally to make the world peaceful ending all the focuses on war and altering it to reconstruction and negotiation. Months after the Zero Requiem,Nunnallyis seen thinking about her brother's sacrifice and honoring that sacrifice by helping Suzaku create a world without conflict. He was speechless when he discovered that Lelouch had been revived and when they were attacked by various consciousnesses in the C's World, Lelouch thought about how to save Nunnally alone but she refused to separate from him. After escaping fromC's WorldNunnally and Suzaku tell Lelouch to stay but he refuses saying that he cannot stay, something that saddens Nunnally but comforts her knowing that Lelouch is alive and and he is with thewomanhe loves."
How old is Shamnacould?,no longer ages,Code of immortality,"Due to the instabilities he caused within C's World interfering with the tranfer of the Code, he is a Failed One, though the exact properties of being such are currently unknown. He was seen able to regenerate as normal after falling a great height prior to his mind being restorted, and can grant Geass. However, he may not be immune to the effects of Geass, asShamnacould not stop his despite being one in a simiular state as him. He also no longer ages."
What is Nunnally's greatest weakness?,her kind heart,Personality,"Throughout the series Nunnally has shown to be almost inhumanly kindhearted, patient and understanding. She endured her double handicap of blindness and paralysis with a smile and warmth and she is kind and empathetic to all those around her. Nunnally has gentle ideals and due to her tellingEuphieto not expose her and her brother's royalty as well as her belief that whatZerois doing is wrong, she is on a neutral side meaning she will make the world a better place in her way. However, like Lelouch, Nunnally has shown that she can make heavy-hearted decisions bordering on ruthlessness, and even attempted to perform actions that exceeds her abilities, as shown when she willingly fires multipleF.L.E.I.J.A.in order to make it a symbol of hatred for the entire world. Despite this, Nunnally's greatest weakness is her kind heart, unable to be as cold and calculating as her brother. Her greatest characteristic is her smile which, according to Lelouch, is her way of expressing gratitude to people around her. Nunnally is unable to walk, see, or take care of herself, so the least she could do is smile."
Who does Nunnally have a dress to wear in lieu of an ordinary prisoner jumpsuit?,Kallen Stadtfeldis,Second season,"Nunnally vi Britannia as the Viceroy of Area 11. The second season reveals that everyone's memories of Nunnally have been erased, Lelouch's included. Everyone at Ashford Academy believes thatClara Lanfrancand laterRolo Lamperougeis Lelouch's younger sibling instead, and has been the entire time. It is unknown if Nunnally and Julius encountered each other between the two seasons. After recovering his memory, Lelouch deduces that Nunnally is likely being held hostage by the Emperor, who would not hesitate to use his children to achieve his goals. As a result, Lelouch must try to maintain the masquerade that he has not regained his memories in order to protect her. Nunnally makes her first appearance in the second season as a Britannian princess and the new Viceroy of Area 11. She still remembers Lelouch, though she is unaware of his identity as Zero. Nunnally suspects that something has happened between her brother and Suzaku. Nunnally has vowed to continue her late older half-sisterPrincess Euphemia's will by reinstating the Special Administrative Region in Japan, sharing her and Suzaku's belief that the world can be changed in gentle ways. AfterKallen Stadtfeldis captured and sent back to Area 11, Nunnally has her transferred to a better facility and gives her a dress to wear in lieu of an ordinary prisoner jumpsuit. They strike up a conversation about Lelouch, which Suzaku interrupts. He asks to speak with Kallen alone, specifically using her prisoner number rather than her name, which Nunnally notices. She also suspects that he is lying about Lelouch to protect her. During a meeting discussing the redevelopment of the ghettos, she confrontsAlicia Lohmeyeron the burdens it places on the Eleven population, able to tell from holding her hand that she is downplaying the problems it will cause. She insists that it be rewritten until it does not do so. During the second battle of Tokyo, Rolo and Sayoko are sent to retrieve Nunnally. Though Sayoko manages to commandeer the transport set to evacuate Nunnally, both are seemingly killed when they are caught in the blast radius of Nina's F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb, fired unwillingly by Suzaku when his life was in danger under Lelouch's Geass Command. When Lelouch converses with Charles and Marianne inThe Ragnarök Connection , it is revealed that Nunnally's injuries were orchestrated by V.V., who set her up to be a witness to the murder of her mother. Her blindness, which was thought to be psychological, was actually the result of Charles' Geass, done to protect her against possible reprisal by V.V. Charles then chose to send them both away, arguing that he was doing so to protect them from V.V., whom he felt he could no longer trust. When Nunnally reveals that she is still alive , she says to Lelouch and Suzaku that they are now her enemy. During theBattle of Mt.Fuji, Nunnally fires F.L.E.I.J.A. bombs at her brother to stop him, but all of them fail to do so. Later, as the final battle rages, she drops the Damocles Key and falls off of her wheelchair, crawling around looking for the Key. Lelouch manages to make his way onto the Damocles and confronts her, but is shocked that Nunnally was able to break through Charles' Geass when she opened her eyes to greet him, asking if he will use Geass on her. Nunnally opens her eyes. Nunnally refuses to give Lelouch the Damocles Key, and she explains thatDamocleswill become a symbol of hatred among the people, allowing them to move forward into the future once it's gone. Nunnally under the influence of Lelouch's Geass. As Lelouch has deemed that her ideals will not conflict with his plans, he promptly uses his Geass to force Nunnally to relinquish the key and uses Damocles to take over the world. Calling him a coward and a liar, Nunnally can only watch helplessly as Lelouch walks down the stairs, preventing her from chasing after him, going as far as to fall out of her chair onto the stairs, brokenhearted. Nunnally weeps over her brother's death. Two months later, Nunnally is a prisoner bound in chains and forced to wear a rather revealing red dress, being taken to witness the execution of the U.F.N. leaders, kneeling behind Schneizel. When Suzaku, in the guise of Zero, appears and impales Lelouch on his sword, Nunnally can only watch in shock. When Lelouch falls near her, she takes his hand and realizes that he has sacrificed himself on purpose. Declaring her love for her brother, Nunnally cries hysterically as Lelouch dies. Nunnally holds Suzaku's hands. InTurn 25.01, she visits the rebuilt Ashford Academy with Zero to meet her friends from the Student Council."

But keep your eyes open, keep them open no matter how dark the night ahead may be. If you avert your eyes from the dark, you'll be blind to the rays of a new day. "" Gintoki Sakatais the main protagonist of theGintamaseries. He is the founder and president of theYorozuya, as well as a highly-skilled samurai, having fought in the Joui War in the past. During the war, he became known as theShiroyasha due to his powerful swordsmanship, demonic appearance, white clothing, and silver hair."
What did Gintoki do before becoming a child scavenger?,"He gained the nickname ""Corpse Eating Demon"" from the nearby villagers due to being commonly seen wandering in deserted battlefields searching corpses for food and weapons to survive",Background,"It is unknown where he was born, what happened to his parents, and what he was doing before becoming a child scavenger. It is also unknown how long he was doing this. He gained the nickname ""Corpse Eating Demon"" from the nearby villagers due to being commonly seen wandering in deserted battlefields searching corpses for food and weapons to survive. During one search, Gintoki encountersYoshida Shouyouwho had heard the rumors about the child and came to investigate. Taking a liking to Gintoki and seeing himself in the child, Shouyou gave Gintoki his sword and asked him to follow him. Gintoki became Shouyou's first student at his newly opened school,Shoka Sonjuku, where he learned basic swordsmanship and academics. After gathering more students, all mostly poor, the school earns the attention and scrutiny of the wealthier people in the village. They also gained the attention of two military academic students who became disillusioned with the academy and the people attending it,Katsura KotarouandTakasugi Shinsuke. The two were attracted by the school's goal for the children, striving to achieve their own ideal of a samurai while struggling against themselves. The two will later officially join after helping fend off some officials from trying to arrest Shouyou. Gintoki later earns himself a rival in Takasugi. Years later during theKansei Purge, despite Gintoki's best efforts to stop them, theTenshouin NarakuarrestedShouyouand burned down the school. Before leaving,ShouyouaskedGintokito protect his fellow students, as a promise, to whichGintokimentally agreed. After learning what happened, the students decided to join the ongoing Joui War, allied with the Joui, to rescue their imprisoned teacher. They metSakamoto Tatsumaduring the fight andGintokigains the nickname Shiroyasha due to his mostly white attire, silver hair, and of course, his ferocious fighting style. At one point,Takasugiasked Gintoki to protect Shouyou in his stead, though Gintoki never truly agreed and instead asked Takasugi for a promise: to stay alive. During a battle, after Sakamoto was taken off the front lines due to injury, everyone except Gintoki, Katsura, and Takasugi was killed, and the trio was captured. Gintoki was forced to choose between killing Shouyou to save Katsura and Takasugi and vice versa. He decided to keep his promise to Shouyou and protect his friends, but in turn ""broke"" his promise to Takasugi. Shouyou gives Gintoki a final ""thank you"" before he is beheaded by him. After their enemies left, the trio buried their teacher's head and their comrades' corpses, then went their separate ways, leaving the war. Sakamoto was only able to find Gintoki before he too, left. Sometime later, a wandering Gintoki overheard a man trying to offer hisdaughterto be executed in his place to a group of officials. The man was a Joui informant who had given up information on certain Joui and their families to these officials that belonged to a political faction within the government. Gintoki offered himself in the daughter's place to protect her; both he and the informant were arrested. In jail, he unknowingly met the girl that he saved, who was adopted by the executioner, the16th Ikeda Yaemon. He saw Gintoki's deeds, and after executing Asaemon's father, declared that he had no right to execute the person who was a good man, then presumed to release him. Injured and starving he wandered in the cold winter night to a graveyard to die, until he encounteredOtoseleaving food offerings at herhusband's grave that he was leaning on. He asked her if he could have the manjuu offerings she set down and she told him to ask her husband, who was receiving the offerings instead of her. Gintoki then ate her husband's manjuu without asking him, saying that dead people don't speak. In return, he made a promise to her husband that he would protect Otose until she dies. After this encounter, Gintoki became a tenant on the second floor ofSnack Otoseand founded theOld YorozuyawithKanemaru,Ikesawa, andFuruhashi. Together, their business flourished and they became famous. Nevertheless, for many reasons, Gintoki threw his partners into a river and ended up working in the Yorozuya alone until the start of the series."
What is Gintoki's past?,"poverty and unwillingness to do mostly anything, he is always behind on his rent and often runs away when Otose, his landlady, comes to collect the payment. He often blows all of his savings on Pachinko and other gambling games, which Shinpachiand Kaguraoften scold him for. However, even though he is lazy, Gintoki is quite dedicated to his job and tries to help people to the best of his abilities (usually in a very strange and twisted way). He is sarcastic and unattached but he values connections more than anything in the series. For the most part, Gintoki is content with hanging out with his friends. However, different aspects of his personality emerge depending on the situation.",Personality,"Gintoki is extremely lazy. He is often seen wearing a dumb expression on his face and spends his days lounging around reading Shounen Jump while imparting wise and sage-like advice to his younger employees, even though he doesn't actually know what he's talking about most of the time. Due to his poverty and unwillingness to do mostly anything, he is always behind on his rent and often runs away when Otose, his landlady, comes to collect the payment. He often blows all of his savings on Pachinko and other gambling games, whichShinpachiandKaguraoften scold him for. However, even though he is lazy, Gintoki is quite dedicated to his job and tries to help people to the best of his abilities . He is sarcastic and unattached but he values connections more than anything in the series. For the most part, Gintoki is content with hanging out with his friends. However, different aspects of his personality emerge depending on the situation. In the more comedic arcs, he is characterized as cowardly and sarcastic, but in serious arcs, he is unwavering and will die for someone who he cares about. He very much enjoys joking, being passionate, and arguing about stupid stuff so he and his friends at the end of the day can have a good laugh. Gintoki's past continues to influence who he is and how he acts. He admitted toUmibozuinEpisode 42that he believes that having a loving family is all someone really needs in life, due to his lack of a family during his childhood. He is very respectful of the memory of his teacher Yoshida Shouyou due to his actions . WhenJiraiacalled himselfTsukuyo's teacher and yet harmed her both emotionally and physically, his ideal for what a teacher was supposed to be resulted in Gintoki becoming enraged and taking his anger out on Jiraiya. His inability to protect many of his friends in the Joui War still haunts him, especially the crushing guilt and regret that consumed him when theTendoshuforced him to execute his own teacher in front of Takasugi and Katsura. As a result, he is very protective of his current friends and holds very little value to his own life. This carelessness can be seen in how Gintoki can plow through armies without tiring, apathetic to the serious injuries he sustains while cutting down his enemies. He toldKawakami Bansai, during theShinsengumi Crisis Arc, that the only reason he fought in the Joui War was to protect his friends and not his country or the samurai way. The more comical stories depict Gintoki as a coward, attempting to leave behind many of his friends to save his own life. However, he is willing to risk his life for anyone and he is shown to be extremely caring towards his friends and has killed Naraku members, terrorists, andAmantoto protect them. He is extremely frightened of ghosts, but will usually deny their existence so that he doesn't look like a coward. His fear of the supernatural is shared by Hijikata and usually results in quite a few comic interactions between the two. He has many childish personality traits despite his age, and has even called himself a ""child in a man's body."" One such trait is his insatiable love for sweets, which has placed him at risk of getting diabetes several times. His favorite food is chocolate parfait and he loves chugging down strawberry milk whenever he gets access to it. He also is repeatedly shown to have difficulty expressing his emotions and often disguises his true feelings under a cold outer layer; for example, when Umibouzu arrived to take Kagura home, he inadvertently made Kagura feel hurt and rejected by telling her to leave with him, despite having the best intentions for her. He loves alcohol, but his tolerance for sake is not high. At one point, his tendency to act like a complete idiot while being completely smashed resulted in the major female characters Otose,Shimura Tae,Kyuubei,Sarutobi Ayameand Tsukuyo deciding to teach him a lesson by playing a prank on him along withZenzouduring theScandal Arc. Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, such as Shimura Tae, Sarutobi Ayame and Tsukuyo, it is shown that most of their love is unrequited. However, he does have a huge crush on the weather girl,Ketsuno Ana, and once stated he wished to marry her . While Gintoki does not seem to care for any of the women he knows, he still gets excited when he sees random beautiful women, for example, when he was spying on the women in an indoor pool with binoculars and got super excited until he found out the woman he had taken a liking to was Tsukuyo. After realizing this he lost all interest, commenting on how she is a ""drunk terminator"". He also got excited when he saw a girl with ""big jugs"" not realizing the girl was actually Kyuubei.
According toTama, Gintoki is quite a sadist, much likeOkita Sougo. This may possibly explain why Sougo feels a certain attachment to him as he addresses Gintoki as ""Danna"" . This can be shown as he always mistreats Sarutobi, Katsura, and Hijikata in various extreme ways and his tendencies on quitting easily on certain moments which can lead to a punishment and someone's death, in which he can handle easily and even enjoy it. He actually has some knowledge of certain sadistic and abusive fore-play showed throughout the series, as he hires prostitutes for Shinpachi and Sarutobi obsession with him. He admits being a sadist, liking to see Ketsuno Ana being abused and his tendency to abuse everyone he is attached to. Despite or due to all of these traits Gintoki possesses an immense amount of charisma and has amassed a quite large group of friends. When it is needed, he is able to impart words of wisdom and can make those around him feel much more alive even with his inappropriate jokes and deadpan statements. This ability has given him very loyal allies, friends, and even former enemies. AsHinowapointed out, he was able to affect Tsukuyo and even made friends with theShogun, despite the situation always turning out less than ideal whenever the latter would be around."
What is Gintoki's biggest weakness?,his rage/anger,Strength & abilities,"Gintoki's feats are very wide, being a veteran in the Joui War. His powerful swordplay and range of abilities gave him the nickname ""Shiroyasha"" . He is capable of turning the tide of any battle, being called ""The Ace"" by Katsura and Takasugi. He defeated strong Amanto and killed many high ranking ones, even those who are in legendary status . He's also strong enough to defeat opponents considered the strongest in their respective class.."" On the battlefield, his merciless abilities and savage swordsmanship were so notorious that the mere mention of his name is said to have once struck fear in the hearts of every Amanto. Several shinobi and samurai who have fought with him have observed that his swordplay is self-taught, but far from unrefined. Okita Sougo, the Shinsengumi's finest swordsman, has noted how unpredictable his style is. Gintoki tends to wield full-length katanas and bokutos single-handedly, even double wielding them at times. However, his biggest weakness is his rage/anger. Despite becoming faster and stronger, he is a berserker whose only goal is to kill his enemy, leading to enemies that are equal or stronger than him to defeat him or hold him off, as was the case with Oboro, Jirochou, and his later interactions with Utsuro. During battle, he is known to have displayed unusual strength. Although Gin is more than capable of matching powerful Amanto warriors and various other samurai, he will not hesitate to use tricks and manipulation if it means a quick and easy victory. He does not like to waste time fighting when using a little brains over brawn will yield a much quicker ending. His brute strength is remarkable, being second only to the Yato Clan, Utsuro, and a select few. His strength was shown against Bansai, where he broke steel cables and managed pulled down a helicopter. Against Oboro, he bit through his opponent's katana, and against Housen, he managed to block the former's smash, despite the Yato warrior having destroyed a stone bridge with said attack moments before. Immense Strength: Of the Yorozuya trio, Gintoki's physical strength is not as high as Kagura's, given the fact that he is human while Kagura is from theYato Tribe. However, Gintoki's physical strength is still nothing to scoff at, and he is probably the strongest known human so far, strong enough to even be recognized byKamui, one of the strongest Yato in the series. He can destroy enormous pieces of machinery or drive his blunt bokuto through a man's skull with ease. He was also able to break Oboro's sword by biting it with his teeth. When fighting Kawakami Bansai, Gintoki was able to break through his strings, which were stated to be as strong as steel, with nothing but brute strength alone. He was also able to pull down Bansai's helicopter just with his power. Tremendous Endurance: One of Gintoki's defining traits is his extreme level of physical endurance. Gintoki fights without consideration for his life, most of the time, and while this gives him the ability to fight without limits, it is also a testament to how little Gintoki values his own life. Coupled with his incredibly high pain tolerance this makes him an incredibly fearsome fighter. A day after having his forearm impaled by Doromizu Jirochou, Gintoki fought evenly alongside him to defeat dozens ofShinraassassins, withstanding countless injuries in the process and losing very high amounts of blood. After having his pressure points and body mangled by Oboro, Gintoki is able to outmatch the elite Naraku swordsman in their second bout despite being completely incapacitated moments before. During his fight with Kamui, Gintoki takes blows from one of the strongest Yato warriors to exist and has his index finger broken completely, but continues to stand and fight. Umibozu notes Gintoki's tremendous endurance, particularly his eyes, which keep coming back to life despite Kamui seemingly crippling him multiple times. Enhanced Speed and Agility: Gintoki is incredibly nimble, capable of matching the agility of the renowned shinobi Hattori Zenzou. In addition, his reflexes are great and he is capable of dodging, deflecting bullets or in some instances throwback knives, arrows, and similar projectiles. When Gintoki is particularly enraged, his speed and reflexes reach absurd heights, allowing him to perform such feats as shattering a titanium sword in mid-swing with his teeth or closing meters of distance between himself and his target within a fraction of a second. Master Swordsmanship Specialist: Gintoki's swordsmanship is rough, but far from unrefined. He tends to wield even full-length katanas one-handed with fair wide but quick chops. His level of skill has been complemented by several esteemed swordmasters, such asYagyuu Binbokusai, who noted that his style is something not taught but developed by Gintoki himself. He has regularly been able to prove himself equal to some of the best swordsman and warriors in the series, singlehandedly matching up with the likes of Hosen, Kamui, Utsuro, Oboro, and Jirochou. Most notably, Gintoki held his own against Utsuro multiple times, something a team consisting of Sougo, Nobume and Kagura could not manage to do. Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant: As part of his brawler-like fighting style, Gintoki regularly uses his fists and kicks in combat. As such, he is far less bothered by being caught unarmed than most other swordsmen in the series. While his bokuto is usually used to deliver the final blow against an opponent, many of his most consistent damaging attacks are kicks delivered to the torso. Combat Intuition: Gintoki is noticeably skilled in terms of battlefield tactics, likely due to his extensive experience. He is capable of developing adaptive strategies as he fights, often within seconds, and knows exactly what to look for in an opponent's fighting style to create openings for himself. In his first encounter with Oboro, Gintoki countered his pressure point needles mere minutes after experiencing them for the first time. AgainstPluto Batou, Gintoki quickly learned how to confuse Batou's third eye and deliver a crushing blow. When Utsuro and Gintoki fought for the first time, Gintoki parried and blocked Utsuro's impossibly fast swordmanship based on his similarities to Shouyou's style and his own instinct alone. Weapon Expertise: While Gintoki vastly prefers to make use of his swordsmanship in combat, he is well-versed in the use of many types of weapons, from naginatas and kunai to senbon and explosives, likely due to his training as a samurai and time spent on the battlefield. He is able to incorporate the use of almost anything he finds in a fight and frequently catches his opponents off-guard by using his surroundings against them. Spiritual Affinity: Gintoki can see and communicate with spirits, as shown during theGhost Ryokan Arc. However, this ability has failed to manifest on a few occasions and simply applies to specific types of spirits. Musical Talent: Gintoki is shown to be a passable singer and is capable of using the Shamisen. Charisma and Leadership: Just like hisfellowHeavenlyKings, Gintoki has shown to be a charismatic leader. Though in much of the Joui War flashbacks, unlike the other three, he usually works alone with even Takasugi commenting that his specialty was covert operations. His leadership skills, although underplayed, can be seen when he leads some of his present allies in fights. His charisma is the most notable thing in the series as it is thanks to this that he gained friends and allies by both his actions and words."
What happened to Gintoki's Chocolate Parfait?,spilled,Story,"Gintoki's parfait gets spilled inEpisode 3 Gintoki made his first appearance at a café whereShimura Shinpachiwas working, when his Chocolate Parfait was spilled by a couple of troublesome Amanto. In a moment of anger, he punched the manager and beat the Amanto with hiswooden sword. However, Shinpachi was the one to take the blame and lost his job as a result. When Shinpachi's sister,Shimura Tae, learned of his doings, Gintoki was heavily beaten, and he offered Shinpachi a place in the Yorozuya as compensation. Later, Tae was forced to work in an illegal nightclub airship to pay off the debt of her family's dojo, and to save her, Gintoki and Shinpachi rescued her from the debt collectors and destroyed the ship. After bearing witness to his strength, Shinpachi decided to work with Gintoki and learn how to be a true samurai. The two first metKagurawhen she was hit by Gintoki's scooter. They then saved her from being caught by the gang she worked for, which had been using her for herYatostrength. After the gang was beaten, she stayed at Gintoki's house to work for money, thus becoming a part of the Yorozuya."
What is Gintoki's dream of carrying a dying body through a field of corpses?,"he hears a voice from one of the dead bodies telling him to drop who he was carrying, saying that he could not save him and that he ultimately does not have what it takes to rescue anyone, nor protect anyone when it really matters",Harusame arc,"The Yorozuya was asked by a client to find his missing daughter,Kimiko. During the search, they eventually found their way into a shady night club filled withAmanto. In the bathroom of the club, Gintoki bumped intoDarakuand Kimiko, while theHarusamewas trying to get rid of her because of her addiction to a drug called ""Tenseikyou."" He tried to protect Kimiko from them, but due to the shock of seeing Kagura and Shinpachi being taken away by them, Gintoki was caught off guard and impaled in the shoulder by Daraku. The impact caused both him and Kimiko to break and fall out of the window behind them, and both were knocked unconscious. In his unconscious state, Gintoki has a dream of carrying a dying body through a field of corpses, and he hears a voice from one of the dead bodies telling him to drop who he was carrying, saying that he could not save him and that he ultimately does not have what it takes to rescue anyone, nor protect anyone when it really matters. The corpse calls him reckless and uncaring, only swinging his sword at what's in front of him, not protecting anyone. He is also called powerless in an attempt to coax him into just dropping everything , and ""taking the easy road,"" which he wordlessly declines, and is shocked to find the body he is carrying is also a dead corpse. He then awakens. This dream is likely influenced by his subconscious telling him that he is not good enough, and was triggered by his inability to save Kimiko, Shinpachi, and Kagura. After awakening, it is revealed that Gintoki and Kimiko were both saved by Katsura, who informs him of the drug afflicting Himeko and also tells him about theHarusame, and warns him to not try and go after them in his bad condition. Instead of heeding the warning, he insists on saving Shinpachi and Kagura, and, convinced by his desire to protect the two and as well as the fact that he owed Gintoki, Katsura later agreed to go with him. Disguised as ""Space Captains"", they attacked the Harusame's ship. As Katsura bombed their storage to destroy the drug, Gintoki fought and knocked out Daraku and carried Shinpachi and Kagura home."
Who ambushed Gintoki and his former Joui comrade Takasugi Shinsuke?,Gengai,Gengai arc,"To help the neighbors stop a noisy inventor,Hiraga Gengai, the Yorozuya let Shinpachi sing in front of his house. After a while, one of the inventor's robots, Saburo, came out and the group came to meet Gengai. They managed to get inside his garage and moved Gengai's inventions to a place that wouldn't disturb the neighbors, namely the riverbank, but broke them into pieces in the process. Since Gengai needed to prepare the robots for the festival that night, the Yorozuya was forced to help him fix them.
Later on in the festival it is revealed that Gengai was working for Takasugi . Takasugi Threatens Gintoki with his sword on his Gintoki's back, to stand and watch the show. Episode 17 During the festival, Gintoki talked to Gengai about the Joui War, and Gengai asked if Gintoki ever thought of avenging his fallen comrades. Later, while watching the fireworks, he was ambushed by his former Joui comradeTakasugi Shinsuke. Under the threat of a sword at his back, Gintoki was forced to watch Gengai's robots ran wild, attackingthe Shogunand the Shinsengumi. Nevertheless, after a moment, he grabbed Takasugi's sword with his bare hands, completely immobilizing it before punching the other. Gintoki then confronted Gengai and his robot, Saburo, asking him to stop what he was doing. Gengai ordered Saburo to fire towards the Shogun even if Gintoki stood in the way. Gintoki proceeded to attack the robot and destroyed it, noticing for a brief moment that the robot hesitated and lowered its weapon on its own free will."
Where do Gintoki and Kondou Isao find their way to?,Justawayfactory,Memory loss arc,"Gintoki lost his memory inEpisode 31 In a scooter accident, Gintoki lost his memory.KaguraandShinpachitried to trigger the restoration of his memories by visiting many of Gintoki's friends and comrades. They almost succeeded on multiple occasions, but outside interference always ruined their efforts and wiped Gintoki's memory clean. During their visit to Otae, she suggests to Gintoki that he'd be better off forgetting his old self and starting a new life. Meanwhile,Sakamoto Tatsumacrashes his spaceship into the Yorozuya's house, thus wiping out the last remnants of Gintoki's previous existence. Now with no home, memories, or friends, Gintoki declares his old mess of a life to be null and void and decides to disband theYorozuyaand start his life all over again. He is later found, along with commanderKondou Isao, who had also lost his memory because of Otae's cooking, to be working in aJustawayfactory byYamazaki Sagaru, which he had infiltrated because of the factory manager's shady background.

Who is Gintoki?,white ninja,Go-ninja arc,"Katsura asks for Gintoki and the others, to help in rescuing Elizabeth from the clutches of an evil magistrate. Enlisting the help of Sacchan, the four receive some hasty ninja training and form the Go-ninja in order to storm the magistrate's home. Gintoki himself was the white ninja. After clashing with the magistrate's grunts and fighting their way through the various traps, they make it to the final room where Elizabeth was supposedly being held. Instead, they were confronted by Hattori Zenzou and his Shinobi Five. Gintoki faces off against Zenzou, who still holds a grudge over the Jump affair.

Things don't seem to go their way, causing ruckus until the clock runs out of battery and caused them to also froze in time. The SFX replaced the battery of the clock turning everything back to normal. With the time returned to normal, Gintoki slapped his alarm clock and attempts to smash it, and the Universal Clock was nowhere to be found."

What is the name of Gintoki's father?,Takasugi,Shogun assassination arc,"The Yorozuya gets hired by the Shogun and the Shinsengumi to protect him from an assassination attempt. Gintoki also finally had his clash fight with Takasugi in this arc. As such, his past is finally brought to light. When he was taken in by Yoshida, he meets Takasugi and Katsura, students in an official temple school, with former being a scholarship student and the latter, a noble.

Gintoki decides to kill his Sensei, required to do so by himself, to save his comrades, since it is what Yoshida would have wanted. This also explains the reason for Takasugi's grudge against Gintoki After a fierce fight, Gintoki consults Takasugi that even if he has to kill him he would save the soul of his old friend Takasugi of the Yoshida school from his childhood. This led to an outcome where they both fought shortly together against their true enemies of the Naraku faction."
Where were Gintoki and the Yorozuya headed back to?,Earth,Silver soul arc,"After the events occurred in Rakuyo, Katsura and his Jouishishi, Sakamoto and his Kaientai, Tokugawa Nobunobu and Gintoki with his Yorozuya were heading back to Earth and planning how to negotiate with the Altana Liberation Army, how to stop Utsuro and stop the insane war the universe was starting against the Earth. Gintoki and the Yorozuya went to Earth, and the others stayed on space to negotiate with the Liberation Army and to get rid of the fleet of spaceships threatening Earth. When Gintoki and the Yorozuya arrived to Kabukicho, the ""Yorozuya Gin-chan"" establishment was already destroyed by the Amanto and they were taking Otae and Tama with them. Gintoki, speaking in the name of the whole Yorozuya, accepted the job requests from his friends to come back and fight. Right before the fight started, Gintoki made reference to the Japanese tradition of taking off the shoes when going inside someone else's house and said to the Amanto that they couldn't enter this country [Japan] with their stinky feet. While beating the Amanto, Gintoki said that everyone had terminals between their legs, and they could not break those terminals as they did with Edo's Terminal. After saying this, he had two Amanto guys flying from Tama and Otae's hands towards his groin, breaking hid own '""terminal"" in the act. They retired that place and kept fighting in the rest of Kabukicho, and everyone in there started fighting and chasing the Amanto from Kabukicho. After a while, Gintoki is seen in a library reading a Jump magazine about the live-action movie cast . Because of this, the rest of the Yorozuya beat him. After they made a ruckus in the library about the live-action movie cast, the Naraku arrived and assassins dressed in common citizen's garments surrounded them. They fled from there and bumped into Imai Nobume, who helped them out. When they got into a harbor full of containers, they only found an awful carnage of Naraku agents and Amanto made mainly by Utsuro. When Gintoki saw him, he could not resist to his own anger and ended up running towards Utsuro, only to be restrained by a Naraku assassin that was apparently dead. At this point, the Yorozuya with Nobume realized that the Naraku agents had some of Utsuro's blood, and thus they were undead . As Utsuro said that death was unavoidable for everyone, he told Gintoki to choose either die with everyone else without doing anything, or fight until the very end, and Gintoki answered him that he chooses to wield his sword to cut him down. The battle between undead Naraku and Yorozuya started, and, while Shinpachi, Kagura, Sadaharu, and Nobume were slicing the Naraku agents, Gintoki was fighting against the last of the Three Naraku Crows, Hitsugi. He was easily defeated in normal circumstances, but as Gintoki tried to get close to Utsuro, he found out that Hitsugi, as well, had Utsuro's blood in his veins, and Gintoki had a hard time trying to take him out to reach Utsuro. When Gintoki finally had a clean opening to slice Utsuro, the Liberation Army attacked them from the skies as a retaliation for what Utsuro did to them , sending Gintoki flying to a container. Nobume reached him and took him out of there, but the Liberation Army kept attacking them and Nobume threw Gintoki to the water to minimize the damage he could get. When the attacks to the harbor ended, Gintoki got out of the water and helped Nobume to get up, and put her onto Sadaharu's back to get her medical attention as soon as possible. On their way to Kabukicho, they were surrounded by robots from the Liberation Army, but it turned out that a big bunch of these robots was taken by the Shinsengumi, which did a hero-like return. As they continued their way to Kabukicho, the Oniwabanshuu arrived with their leader, Hattori Zenzo, and his second-in-command, Sarutobi Ayame, who went flying towards Gintoki, who beat her with his sword because he thought it was an enemy . Right after that, she embarrassed him confusing an Amanto bazooka with Gintoki's ""terminal"". As they were fighting, the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Gengai Cannon rose from the ground, and Gintoki and company were informed that Sakata Kintoki and Tama were the ones to activate the cannon, which didn't shot anything but nanomachines called ""bees"", which spread a virus and destroyed all the machines and would destroy Kintoki and Tama in the process. The Yorozuya hurried to the place just to see Tama, and they couldn't make it in time. When they finally made it to Kabukicho, the doors were closed, and Otae was throwing big boulders from a building rooftop. She casually threw one that hit Gintoki in his face, causing his eyeball to fall out. As he recovered his eyeball, he got hit in his groin with another boulder, making one of his balls to fall out, too. As Saigo was crushing enemies' ""terminals"", Gintoki fell to the ground with them because he felt what they felt as Saigo ended with their ""terminals"". The only moment that the Yorozuya can enter to Kabukicho is when the leader of the Dakini tribe, Ougai, breaks the entrance with just one swing. Gintoki appeared inside Kabukicho to help Saigo to endure one of the Dakini soldiers, who has a super thick skin and a brute strength. The Yorozuya fought against the Dakini along with the Yagyuu clan, who arrived right on time to endure the attack. Gintoki and his allies had a big fight with Ougai, who seemed to be invincible. When the Hyakka finally made it to Kabukicho, they joined with the Yagyuu clan and the Yorozuya to defeat the Dakini tribe. With Tsukuyo's kunai in one of Ougai's horns and a swing from Gintoki's sword, the horn broke . With this, Ougai was ""defeated"". Right away the Shinra tribe made its appearance and held captive some women, including Otae. Gintoki and Kagura helped Shinpachi to get to his sister and save her, because the Shinra leader, Soutatsu, had dropped her from a tall building. When an elastic web saves both Shinpachi and Otae from falling to death, Doromizu Jirocho, along with his daughter and his yakuza men, executed a trap and took out some of the Shinra soldiers. Then, the Yorozuya and Jirocho fought against the Shinra tribe inside the wrecked building. Gintoki and Jirocho had an advantage against the Shinra, since both of them already knew how the Shinra tribe fight, because they defeated the Shinra soldiers that Kujaku Hime Kada brought with her to take over Kabukicho. With some tricks and the help of Jirocho's yakuza men in Shinra garments, Gintoki and Jirocho took Soutatsu out. When the sun was setting, Gintoki and everyone went to the streets to fight the remaining Amanto in Kabukicho. Ougai got up and tried to get his men to keep on fighting, but this was until Hedoro got rid of Ougai. All of the Kabukicho citizens started chasing away the amanto, and, with the help of the Onmyouji clans, Ketsuno and Shirino clans, even the Kabukicho citizens were being chased away by the illusions the Onmyouji made. Gintoki was especially scared of the ""ghosts"" the Onmyouji portrayed. Everything ended with the successful expel of the Amanto from Kabukicho, but Gintoki ended taking off Hedoro's flower , causing Hedoro to turn into Hedora and try to destroy the world. When the night came and everyone was discussing a way to defend themselves from another attack, Gintoki arrived riding Hevandorogon and revealed that he made the Heva and kept him from destroying the world at least seven times. In the end the Heva just threw him away to protect a little bug on the ground. After this, Gintoki allowed his Yorozuya to rest from the battle and said to them that they were now grown-ups and told them that they were stronger, enough reason for Gintoki to be proud of them, but they couldn't hear him because they fell asleep. Otae heard him and said that they [Shinpachi and Kagura] just missed something they don't hear so often. Finally, Gintoki allowed himself to rest, but when he was falling asleep Gedomaru went and put a Pandemonium on Gintoki's mouth , which made Gintoki to feel deeply disgusted, so he started drinking a lot of alcohol and put earphones to sleep. When he was falling asleep again, Tsukuyo, who was just walking close, stepped on an almost empty bottle that Gintoki had left there, and as she was falling, a little amount of alcohol from the bottle ended in her lips, enough to make her go all drunk and start a wild party where Gintoki was drinking a whole bottle or two . This party was going on when Hijikata informed everyone that Hiraga Gengai, the one who saved Edo from being destroyed by a machine, was missing. Gintoki went with his Yorozuya and the Shinsengumi to look for the old man, but he wasn't even walking. Shinpachi had to carry him in the way because he was now dealing with a hangover. After a bit, he was now able to walk . After they all followed fake clues to Gengai, Kagura followed her Yato instinct and got separated from the group, and thus Gintoki and the rest tried to go with her, but the remaining amanto started a battle, which made the group to lose time. Suddenly, they all saw a space ship that was heading towards them, which turned out to be a Harusame space ship that contained Kamui and his seventh division. With the help of them, they were able to reach Kagura and Kamui, who made it to his sister before then almost everyone. Gintoki and Sougo suggested Kamui that one day they could continue with the fight they had, but at that moment Utsuro appeared, but Gintoki could do much about it. It's there were earthquakes shake all Edo and the Altana started to flow through the cracks. After a bit, Gintoki encounters with Umibozu, who told Gintoki a way to kill Utsuro using Altana from different planets, and gives to a lot of Shinsengumi and Yato agents weapons that work with alien Altana, and gave Gintoki a special weapon, a short sword with alien Altana crystals on its blade. Gintoki again referenced the Japanese traditions, and said that a respected samurai would often carry two swords, a katana and a wakizashi , and then told Umibozu that he already had two swords, referring this time to Shinpachi and Kagura. The battle reset and the ones who had the Altana weapons were now killing the undead Naraku, even Hitsugi felt how his healing faculty was diminished after Gintoki cut off one of his arms with his special sword. When Gintoki encountered Utsuro, he took off both of Utsuro's eyes with the special sword, and thus Utsuro was temporarily blind. But, even like that Utsuro managed to almost kill Gintoki and broke his special sword. Then, Utsuro ruthlessly killed lots of Yato and Shinsengumi officers, saying that humans have done lots of unimaginable things to experiment with him, including taking off his sight, and thus, he learned how to not depend from his sight. He managed to nearly kill Yamazaki with one swing of his sword into Yamazaki's throat. At this point, Sadaharu had already broken from Edo's Castle and searched for Ane and Mone to control the newly risen Dragon Holes, but they were attacked by the Naraku, and Ane and Mone gave to Sadaharu their power to continue and keep dealing with the Dragon Holes. Gintoki and the Yorozuya had a hard time protecting Sadaharu from the Naraku and Utsuro, who tried to kill him because his presence was calming down the Dragon Holes and thus, Utsuro's healing faculty was diminished. But they could do nothing when Sadaharu fell to one of the Dragon Holes and started disintegrating because of Altana. As they fought Utsuro with all they had, Sadaharu just vanished in the Altana, and thus, the Dragon Holes regained their strength and Utsuro had recovered his healing faculty. Gintoki and the Yorozuya couldn't help but get furious at this and they increased their attacks, but due to Utsuro's speed, Gintoki had Utsuro's sword crossing his stomach. When everyone encountered Sadaharu without a body floating and dominating the flows of Altana, Gintoki and his Yorozuya got up and told Utsuro that they would not end there. Because of this, Utsuro was now frightened because of humans and tried to vanish Sadaharu, but Nobume didn't let him do so. Then, Gintoki charged against him and in the very last moment, Utsuro threw himself into a Dragon Hole, making one little amount of Altana to go back to the ocean of Altana, as Gintoki remarked later. Gintoki tried to stop him from doing that, but he could do nothing because they had no time, and the wrecked Amenotori ship was falling from the space to Edo. Gintoki and his allies survived the war. In the few days after the end of the war, he and his Yorozuya met in the remainings of the ""Yorozuya Gin-chan"" establishment, and there Kagura said that she had things to do , and so she had to leave Earth for a while. With this said, Gintoki stated that he also had things to do, and so he left Edo for two years. During these two years, Gintoki traveled through all of Japan looking for every single Dragon Hole, in order to find whether Utsuro or Yoshida Shouyo and finish him, because he reasoned that the way Utsuro vanished from Earth was the same as a drop of water going back to the ocean. He even consulted Ane and Mone, and they told him that visiting every single Dragon Hole in the world would take him his whole life, and this way he wouldn't even have enough time to complete such an enormous task. He answered that he didn't care how much time it would take, but he was hell-bent on finding Utsuro/Shouyo. During his adventures on Japan, Gintoki visited a Dragon Hole in the shores and found out that the people on the temple that guarded the Dragon Hole had witnessed the reborn of a creature that they weren't even sure if it was a human. From the Dragon Hole, it came out a shapeless mass of living meat that eventually took the shape of a baby, who Gintoki recognized as Utsuro/Shouyo. That night Gintoki tried to kill the baby, but he couldn't put an end to him. Gintoki instead took the child with him in his journey, and the child grew up in the blink of an eye. Gintoki himself was not sure if the kid was going to turn into Utsuro or Shouyo, because the kid didn't talk nor he expressed any sort of will. One day, the kid was about to fall from a cliff and Gintoki saved him and said if he was not going to talk at least to ask for a hand, and then, he called him ""Shouyo"" and asked him if it that was how he [Shouyo] felt when Gintoki was following him when he was a child. For the very first time, the kid spoke and told him that he himself was a charming and well-behaved child, but Gintoki was a mischievous and difficult child and recognized that Gintoki had people constantly relying on him and thus he underwent more hardship than the most. Then, he asked Gintoki if he would lend him a hand. Gintoki seemed deeply shocked by having Shouyo talking to him again. At that time, the Naraku was following them, and so they attacked. Shouyo pushed Gintoki from the cliff to save him, and Shouyo took a lot of damage instead of Gintoki, who was now hanging from the cliff. With a broken spear that he took from his own body, Shouyo struck himself in the heart and took it out, a heart made of Altana crystals, and entrusted it to Gintoki. Without this heart, Shouyo could not even be able to maintain his body. Since then, Gintoki was from town to town, escaping from the Naraku, who wanted to steal from him Shouyo's heart. At a point, Gintoki ended in a town where the Shoka Sonjuku school was once placed. Here he encountered Takasugi, and after a short fight, he realized that, somehow, Takasugi had Utsuro's blood in his body and thus he could heal himself. Takasugi escaped, but Gintoki was arrested by the police of the town, commanded by Hijikata. Hijikata tried to get Gintoki to say the reason why he met with Takasugi, but he couldn't get anything out from Gintoki's lips. Even the mobcop that was assigned to assist Hijikata couldn't convince him of speaking with his threats of blowing up Gintoki's mother if he had one. Gintoki actually ended turning the table and made the mobcop cry, asking him if he had a mother and making the mobcop realize that everyone forgot him. Right before the mob cop realized who was him, he asked if they [Hijikata and Gintoki] remembered him, and none of them did at the beginning, enough reason to Yamazaki to go on a rampage and destroy the building where they were. Gintoki escaped during the ruckus. Then Gintoki looked for Takasugi in the town, and he bumped into Kijima Matako and Takechi Henpeita, members of Takasugi's Kiheitai, who were also looking for Takasugi. When they were on a bridge over the town's river, the Naraku attacked Gintoki and he escaped them, and then a boat with dynamite exploded, sending a part of the Naraku flying away. Gintoki ended into the water, and he explained that he couldn't swim , and at this moment is where Takasugi appears on a boat. Takasugi and Gintoki had a discussion about trivial stuff and the Naraku attacked them again, and so Takasugi ended in the water with Gintoki, and both of them fought the Naraku as they used to back in the Joui war. When Takasugi fleed swimming to a ship he had hired before to give him a ride, Gintoki tried to catch him up, but the Naraku and the water didn't let him do so, at least not in a short time. When Takasugi got inside the ship, Gintoki also went onto the ship. He made it to the ship using the Naraku agents' corpses as stepping stones floating all the way to the ship. Here, onto the ship, Gintoki tells Takasugi what happened during the two years after the war and how he obtained Shouyo's heart. Takasugi, as well, told Gintoki how he earned Utsuro's healing faculty through Oboro's remains, and told Gintoki his plan to take Shouyo from the Naraku and Tengenism, and this is where Gintoki was informed that Shouyo's body was still alive and the reason Naraku and Tengenism want Shouyo's heart is to bring Utsuro back to life. The ship where Takasugi and Gintoki were was headed to Edo, and so Gintoki and Takasugi were once again in Edo. They didn't realize that Hijikata and Yamazaki were following them. Takasugi and Gintoki were on separate ways, and Hijikata had trouble on deciding who of Yamazaki and him were going to follow who. And as Hijikata was hiding from Gintoki in a clothes store , Gintoki passed along and then came back to hide as a mannequin to avoid an encounter with Otae, who took both of them as training mannequins to her dojo . Both Hijikata and Gintoki escaped there when Kyuubei threw them far away, and so they ended on Yagyuu Binbokusai's trash. When Gintoki went following a man who resembled Takasugi, the man revealed his true identity and told Gintoki how he ended dressing as Takasugi and how Takasugi had replaced him in a bear disguise. Gintoki let the guy go, and put on himself Takasugi's wig in order to avoid being recognized, but Sarutobi recognized him as Takasugi and cut his cheek with a poisoned kunai that caused on him severe diarrhea, demanding from him the whereabouts of Gintoki . Gintoki tricked her on thinking he was in another clothes market, and so she didn't pay attention to him as he bought a diaper and hurried to hid himself again putting on his face someone else's panties and posing like a sadomasochistic mannequin . As Tsukuyo and Sarutobi saw that Gintoki had Kyuubei's panties on his face , the four of them kidnapped Gintoki and took him to Yoshiwara. Gintoki was hanging above a tank with some suspicious substance, and when he denied opening his mouth about his whereabouts, the girls dropped him and then put him on a conveyor belt that was surrounded by ugly women that seemed to sexually abuse him. When Gintoki had two or three rides, he was turned into a god who was repeating that he had none on his mind. When he himself started another ride through the conveyor belt he escaped, switching places with Yamazaki . Gintoki finally made it to a bridge, fully dressed, and he bumped with Shinpachi, now a grown-up that was running the Yorozuya. Some suspicious men surrounded Gintoki, and Shinpachi helped him to fight them. Gintoki had to borrow a loincloth from someone else's parts to avoid being recognized by Shinpachi. It turned put that these suspicious men weren't Naraku, but where Shachi's men that targeted Shinpachi for being a bad replace for Gintoki. When Shinpachi gave Shachi's manga a review , Shinpachi gave him a professional critique, much to Gintoki's dismay. Then, Ikeda Asaemon arrived to take Shachi back to prison, not before she cut off Gintoki's left nipple instead of Shachi's throat. Shinpachi tried to take off the loincloth from Gintoki's face, which made Gintoki take Shachi and hit Shinpachi with him to knock him. Then Gintoki carried Shinpachi all the way to the rebuilt ""Yorozuya Gin-chan"" establishment. When he left Shinpachi on the couch, Gintoki ran to the bathroom to cleanse his face from the loincloth and dried his face with a bra, making Gintoki get the conclusion that Shinpachi was now so mature that he even took girls to the house. Actually, Kagura was taking a bath and Gintoki was there when she got out, but in the form of an elder lady. Gintoki tricked her on getting a bath again and got out of the bathroom. Gintoki now heard the voice of a girl and thought of Shinpachi as a pedophile. Then, he hears another voice of a young girl looking for her bra, which was still on Gintoki's hand. Kagura destroyed the bathroom's door and took Gintoki's head between her hands, thinking it was an underwear thief. Shinpachi heard the ruckus and got up to check on them, but Gintoki threw an undressed Kagura to Shinpachi and escaped. Kagura realized that it was Gintoki because she had some of Gintoki's hair on her hands and went out to follow him. Kagura finally reached Gintoki when Edo's Terminal exploded, and Gintoki shielded Kagura from the explosion. When Kagura opened her eyes to see him, Gintoki still had her bra on his face, which made Kagura to kick him far from her. After this, Gintoki caught up Takasugi on a rooftop, and threatened him, but then the Naraku appeared and Takasugi stole Shouyo's heart to apparently give it to the Naraku. When Takasugi tried to escape, Katsura appeared and took Shouyo's heart from Takasugi's hands. Katsura was all cool when his hand slipped and let Shouyo's heart fall down, which made both Katsura and Gintoki to run down to reach the heart a hit each other to prevent the other one from taking it. As they were going down, Gintoki realized that Katsura and Takasugi were accomplices and Katsura faked the terrorist attack to Edo's terminal in order to place a decoy to the Tengenism. Takasugi, Katsura, and Gintoki identified themselves as Yoshida Shouyo disciples and fought against the Naraku. At the end of this battle, Gintoki has Shouyo's heart on his hands again and states that he would choose the path neither Takasugi nor Katsura take. If Katsura wants to kill Utsuro, then Gintoki would save him; if Takasugi wants to save Utsuro, then Gintoki would slice him. Then Gintoki said that none of the paths both Takasugi and Katsura choose weren't wrong, so he would now be able to set out on any path. He stated that he would go pure white, in order to save both his master and the world."

Although she doesn't like violence, she clearly uses violence to solve her problems,Hasegawa Taizoulabeled her as 'ultra-hot China girl'. She often quarrels with Shinpachi and Okita physically and verbally. She has a sharp tongue and isn't afraid to speak her mind or insult people even if it's to strangers. She takes in things that Gintoki says as a form of advice, oftentimes in an inappropriate context. She acts very ""unladylike"" in terms of the ways she speaks and things such as vomiting or picking her nose. However, she is still a young girl who likes others to pamper her and on some occasions has shown to have a girly side. Although she acts like she doesn't care for the Yorozuya she really does care for the Yorozuya as seen through her actions towards them such as trying to protect them when they're hurt in a fight. She loves eating and seems to have an insatiable appetite, with a particular fondness for rice andsukonbu. She seems to have strong 'maternal instincts' as seen in various parts of the anime, like when she wanted to breastfeed""Gin's"" childinEpisode 51. Kagura also has an obsession with big breasts likeSarutobi Ayame's. She added oranges to her chest inEpisode 138when talking about the 'fleshy woman' in the photo. In Gintama Movie: Be Forever Yorozuya, she is seen to have the personality of atsundere.

Abuto has suggested that Kagura is among the highest elite of the Yato, equal only to Kamui, Umibouzu, and Housen, meaning her abilities far exceed that of an average Yato, but her kind nature holds her back, only when she is ""awakened"" can she use it to her full potential. Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Due to the Yato blood running through her veins she is exceptionally strong, but can also lose control of her power and ""awaken"" when her friends are in serious danger.[2]Her Yato killer instincts are suppressed because she doesn't like it. However, her instincts were ""awakened"" in Yoshiwara Blaze arc in her battle withAbutowhen he hurt Shinpachi. Yato Mode: Kagura, in a panic, once tapped into the full potential of her Yato heritage which transformed her into a monster bent only on killing Abuto. She has no control over herself in this state and says she does not remember anything other than feeling anger. In this state, Kagura's strength and fighting ability go up tremendously enough to where she can overwhelm the Abuto, who was stronger when she was not ""awakened"" albeit missing an arm. For her killing blow, she drove a Naginata through his shoulder and crashed him through the wall all in one move. Kagura was only able to get out of this state because Shinpachi's words reached her and refuse to ever enter this state again as she fears she might completely lose herself to the Yato heritage within herself. In the Benizakura arc, she has shown amazing healing abilities afterKijima Matakoshot her. Kagura was able to catch the bullets with her hands and mouth. She also carries a parasol around as protection from the sun, since the Yato species are averse to sunlight but the parasol also acts as a weapon that can fire bullets like a machine-gun. In theBentendo Oweechapter, her fighting ability enabled her to be the first to defeat the final boss/Maou. During the two year time skip, she has also trained the ability to change her age at will, appearing at times as a younger version of herself, and at other points, assuming an elderly appearance."

He was taken off the front lines due to his injury, and by the time he had recovered, he discovered that Gintoki, Takasugi, and Katsura had disappeared.

Later, upon learning of the Chidori supervisor's plan to kill her and the slaves, she instructed him to free the slaves and escaped, whereas she chose to surrender herself. Nevertheless, Sakamoto let the slaves take over the fleet and defeated the pirates to save her. The pirates were then thrown to the ocean. Afterwards, the fleet becameKaientai, with he and Mutsu being the leader and second-in-command, respectively."
What happened to Sakamoto when he was bitten in the head by Sadaharu?,he ignored the staff's warning and left with the dog on his head,Running kaientai,"During their years of running Kaientai, the company made a business transaction withDark Vader. Though, during the negotiation, Sakamoto did nothing but vomit. While Mutsu was out, he misunderstood Dark Vader's placards and eventually agreed with his offer, not knowing that the Amanto's true intention was to take over the Earth. When the negotiation had ended, although Mutsu pointed out his mistakes, Sakamoto ignored her, still believing that the Renho Tribe wanted to protect the Earth. It is presumed that he gaveElizabethtoKatsuraat this time, as a gift from the business. At one point in the present, Sakamoto went on a space-travelling trip from Earth. While waiting for the ship, he was bitten in the head bySadaharu, but he ignored the staff's warning and left with the dog on his head. When the ship was attacked by Joui extremists, Sakamoto inadvertently defeated a shooter threatening theYorozuya. However, he was kicked byKagura, who accused him of stealing Sadaharu. As soon as the bombs in the pilot room exploded, Sakamoto was dragged there byGintoki, who had recognized him after the kick. In the pilot room, seeing the Yorozuya struggling to take over the rudder, he broke up the fight, but also broke the rudder in the process. After the ship fell into a planet, the passengers were saved by theKaientaifleet led by Mutsu. Though, the fleet's landing woke up a giant, native sand bug, which caught the passengers and Sakamoto. He shot the bug's tentacles to free the others, yet he let himself dragged to the ground, insisting Mutsu to fire cannon at the bug, even if it meant his death. Gintoki then interrupted the fire and saved Sakamoto successfully."
Who did Sakamoto convince the Renho to ally with?,Dark Vader,Renho arc,"As a result of theKaientai's deal with Dark Vader, theRenho Tribecarried on a plan to take over the Earth. Upon seeing the Renho takinng action, Sakamoto visited the Earth and took the Yorozuya, Katsura andFumikoon his fleet, where he revealed his earlier business and got beaten as a result. UnderMutsu's plan, everyone sneaked onto the Renho ship, whereas she bought more time by trying to make anothehr deal withDark Vader. Nevertheless, on board, Sakamoto, Gintoki and Katsura made a fuss about their meals and somewhat attracted the Renho's attention. Luckily, they were covered byElizabeth, who recognized them. Afterwards, the trio even gave tips to take over Earth and played Uno with them. As soon as Mutsu's attempt failed and the Kaientai staff was imprisoned, a dispatch order was given to the Renho people. Sakamoto and Gintoki parted from Katsura, who attempted to fight with a Ginsam robot. However, it exploded, causing chaos among the Renho. Sakamoto and Gintoki tried to find Dark Vader, but the two ended up revealing their identities as samurai from Earth to the other Renho people. Though, Sakamoto managed to convince the Renho to ally with him, in exchange of a vast amount of Famicom games After the tribe opened fire on their own leader, the mothership's core, SAGI, revealed itself to be Dark Vader's true form. In reaction, Mutsu combined the Kaientai fleet into a gigantic robot called ""Kaien,"" much to Sakamoto's surprise. Despite his disapproval, he was assigned to control the robot's left arm. Later, with Fumiko destroying the core from the inside, everyone united and shot the final blow to the core, causing it to explode. Consequently, everyone was caught in the explosion, and the Earthlings' memory was deleted byEren. Since the whole Kaientai fleet was destroyed in the explosion, it was temporarily replaced by a Renho spacecraft, making Sakamoto go off at Mutsu for modifying his ships without permission. Having his memory deleted, he wondered if he was forgetting something important. Fortunately, he still recalled of the events in time and bid a farewell to Eren with Uno cards."
What happened to Sakamoto after he threw a rock at his head?,"he grew panic after finding no one in the ocean, and was soon picked up by the Chidorifor the second time. He was then held captive by the pirate, who wanted the whole Kaientai fleet back. In spite of their threat, Mutsu fired cannon at him, claiming that this was a chance to kill him off. As Mutsu stood up and defeated the pirates, Sakamoto and Gintoki were thrown into the enemy's cannons in the process, thus having their faces disfigured. Seeing Mutsu seemingly dead after reaching his place, Sakamoto got angry and hit the Chidori supervisor in the head, asking to have her back. As Mutsu stood up and defeated the pirates, Sakamoto and Gintoki were thrown into the enemy's cannons in the process, thus having their faces disfigured. Sakamoto then introduced a bag containing 50 million yen as his latest product, even though it was only an ordinary bag full of rocks inside. He then gave these bags away to the hostesses in Snack Smileas a way to impress Oryou. An angry Mutsuarrived, threw a rock at his head, stuffed him into a bag, and threw him to the ocean. Initially, he reacted to this cheerfully, believing that it was only a joke. Though, he grew panic after finding no one in the ocean, and was soon picked up by the Chidorifor the second time.

What happened after the events on the Rakuyou planet?,"Sakamoto and Mutsu, Katsura and Elizabeth, Gintoki with his Yorozuya and Tokugawa Nobunobu made a plan to negotiate with the Altana Liberation Army and stop the rising war",Silver soul arc,"After the events on the Rakuyou planet, Sakamoto and Mutsu, Katsura and Elizabeth, Gintoki with his Yorozuya and Tokugawa Nobunobu made a plan to negotiate with the Altana Liberation Army and stop the rising war. While Gintoki and his Yorozuya went back to Earth, Katsura and his Jouishishi men and Sakamoto with his Kaientai stayed by Nobunobu's side when he went to negotiate to the Amenotori ship. At the beginning it was okay, but due to a food poisoning caused by Kagura, Nobunobu couldn't help but ask for the bathroom. Katsura and Sakamoto stayed with Nobunobu in the Amenotori ship within a few days, and both Sakamoto and Katsura helped investigating two familiar space sagas borrowed from the ship. When the day finally came, Nobunobu and his ""advisers"" Sakamoto and Katsura had a word with the Admiral Shijaku. Every time Nobunobu tried to run to the bathroom, Sakamoto and Katsura made him stay sitted, holding whatever was going to go out. After some interesting chit chat, Sakamoto and Katsura finally let Nobunobu run to the bathroom, but at the time both put a friendly palm on Nobunobu's back, he finally let everything out and didn't made it to the bathroom. When the Kaientai ships were about to leave the Amenotori Ship's ports, Prince Enshou took over the Altana Liberation Army leadership and imprisoned all of the Kaientai fleet, including Nobunobu, Mutsu and Sakamoto. After a while, Shijaku made it to liberate himself and the Kaientai fleet , and joined Sakamoto and his Kaientai against Enshou. Before everyone starts their way through the ship, Nobunobu tries to communicate with anyone at Edo's Castle, but finds out that Princess Soyo was at the other side of the line. Nobunobu refused to talk with her, so Sakamoto did it instead of him. Through his way to the Control Center of the ship, Takasugi interrupted his way to Enshou for a bit. When Sakamoto and his men finally made it to Enshou, they started fighting. Sakamoto fired his gun, and for a while seemed like Enshou had been fatally injured by Sakamoto, but his bullet hit a collar that Enshou had always hanged on his shoulders. The real fight started then, and Mutsu saved Sakamoto's life by taking a hit from Enshou's beam sword. Sakamoto fought with everything he had, until he finally convinced an injured Enshou to change hearts and join him on defeating Utsuro and his Naraku, and then Enshou and Nobunobu received some bullets and both passed away. Sakamoto then is treated, due to his severe injuries. He stays there and tries, without any success, to stop the Amenotori ship from falling to Earth, and peacefully awaits for a death that never came. After two years since the end of the war, Sakamoto put a lot of money into cryptocurrency and lost everything, forcing him and Mutsu to temporarily disband the Kaientai and gather enough money to restart and join all the Kaientai fleet again."

What does Saitama's indifference rest solely on his hero work? Available choices: (A). None of the above choices. (B). He does not take his hero work seriously. (C). He does not take his hero work seriously. (D). He does not take his hero work seriously.,(B).,Personality,"Saitama's character on the upper surface can be best summed up as ""average"". At first glance, nothing about him strikes anyone he meets or causes them to note anything remarkable about him. Before becoming a hero, he was an average salaryman and did not seem interested in anything initially, though becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitama's.[27]Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated with society, just likeHammerheadand even commenting that he could have become just like him depending on the path he took.[28] Due to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[29]The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[7]and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled considerably.[30]The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and ""unimpressive"" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[31] Saitama's indifferent expression after knowing people speaking ill of him. Saitama's indifference doesn't rest solely on his hero work either. In daily life, he is often seen lounging around, playing video games, reading manga, or going out for strolls. His taste in food is rather plain, and he often frequents food stalls rather than going to restaurants or cooking at home. As his primary interest, hero work has become unfulfilling, and he pays little attention to anything else. A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgotSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[32]or when he could not remember whoTanktop Tigerwas.[33]Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[34]Saitama does not care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[35]the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything about his lack of hair.[36][37]He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. Saitama's reaction knowing he will miss a bargain sale. Despite his indifference, Saitama can find things that interest him and actively looks for activities to relieve his boredom. These things tend to be mundane activities such as watching TV, shopping, or lazing about. He shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he foughtCarnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent, who had undergone atransformationand was beating him around.[38] Saitama gets impatient with Genos' explanation. He can also express irritation and even outright anger depending on the situation. However, Saitama has limited patience for long explanations and often interrupts the speaker.[39][40][41]His ideal word count is 20 or less.[39]He can get angry when he loses to someone like King when they play games. He will become enraged if anyone messes with his food or damages his home as he immediately killed a mantis monster for crashing through his roof and told Genos to move his fight with Sonic somewhere away from his apartment. Aside from being quite a cheapskate due to his financial status, he has a greedy side seen when he tried to steal bags of gold from the underground mine inside theMonster Association Headquartersand was visibly upset after accidentally dropping them down to the bottom of an underground ravine.[42] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans despite his years of heroing. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[43]Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated whenGenoslisted off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes. Beneath the surface, Saitama is much more complex than his appearance and attitude suggest. While he scored low on the written portion of the hero exam, he is, by no means, unintelligent. Saitama is very observant, insightful, and has high tactical awareness. This is seen in how he could easily discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him. He could pick up several hints about Sonic's persona upon their first meeting.[44]When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after themeteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discernFubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[45]Saitama has shown remorse to his enemies before, particularly those who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this isBoros, the self-claimed ""Dominator of the Universe"", with whom Saitama sympathized due to suffering from similar circumstances, though, in the end, even Boros still could not draw out Saitama's full power.[46] Saitama tends to come off as abrasive to others and often is inconsiderate of their feelings or how his words affect them. That isn't to say he is intentionally malicious or rude, but rather that his indifference extends to his social interactions. He reacted to Fubuki greeting him as the number 1 B-Class heroine with a quick acknowledgement but seemed otherwise unimpressed frustrating Fubuki. He also downplays the gravity of situations based on his own perspective rather than that of others, never considering that those without his earth-shattering power would be rightly more horrified in extreme cases like Boros threatening to destroy the world or the monster society declaring open war on humanity. During his fight with Garou, Saitama initially displayed his unconcerned attitude against the Human Monster, from playful banter to compliments on Garou's capability. Saitama turning the civilians against him. Despite his aloof, carefree, and uninterested demeanor, Saitama is actually one of the most morally upright heroes in the story. While many other heroes only care about personal achievements so they can rank up in order to gain more fame and popularity, Saitama is very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against theDeep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival wanting to give credit to the heroes that were actually risking their lives to protect innocent people.[47]Saitama did the same for thepolice station, killing a monster while disguised as apolice officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was as he heard the Hero Association executive try to force the police to beg for assistance exclaiming that, ""Police and heroes don't help people because someone had to beg"".[48]This is also his outlook on being a hero as he told Genos, ""If heroes run and hide, who will stand and fight"". He also did not mind thatKingtook credit for all of his achievements.[49]One of the most understated signs of Saitama's high morality is that he never uses his incredible strength for evil, even though no one can stop him from doing whatever he wants. Saitama telling Genos he's gotten stronger. Although he may initially rub people the wrong way and seldom shows his emotions to others, it doesn't mean Saitama doesn't show care for the people around him or their physical or mental well-being. On some occasions, he's helped people with their mental issues, such as a suicidal man wanting to jump off a building,[50]and giving words of encouragement to Fubuki about how she should not seek the approval of others but live her life how she wanted.[51]He promisedTareoto stop Garou without killing him,[52]and complimented Genos after the cyborg saved Tatsumaki by claiming that his heart had grown stronger.[53] While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing anotherhumanand only ever uses enough strength to knock them out. His restraint is so ingrained that no matter the opponent's power and no matter how much Saitama knows about them, he only kills when he intends to kill, even if he hits someone unexpectedly, such as the number of times he's knocked out Garou. Saitama exhibiting a somber demeanor following Genos' death in the Ominous Future. In theOminous Future, after the deaths of Genos and many other heroes at the hands of Garou, Saitama becomes despondent. He begins questioning his intuition as a hero, lamenting that he tends to arrive too late to prevent such tragic outcomes. Quickly, this changes into a state of tranquil anger, where he decides to no longer hold back against Garou. The death of Genos also causes Saitama to lose any potential excitement at facing the Hero Hunter, despite considering Garou a strong opponent who may provide him with a challenging fight, showing his depression at his disciple's end.[54]In spite of his anger towards Garou for his cruel doings, at the end of their fight, Saitama recalls his promise to Tareo about not killing Garou . He eventually calms down and reverts to his casual, relaxed demeanor, complying with the Hero Hunter's request to teach him a time travel technique. Garou later comments that individuals of such immense power as himself and Saitama require the presence of others to act as anchors, to help them maintain their sanity - the sense of isolation that accompanies such unparalleled strength can be enough to drive even the most powerful beings to the brink of madness.[55] Saitama motivates Glasses to become stronger. Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos quit his revenge wishes and start focusing on training to become a good and strong hero.[56][57]He has also made insecure people like Fubuki andGlassesstand up to their challenges and become better heroes.[58]Saitama also advises King to train and become strong for real, rather than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles.[59] As Genos notes, Saitama ""attracts the strong"", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a liking to him.[60]This is due to his lack of interest in hero ranking and fame that attracts them.[61]"
"How many days did Saitama do push-ups, sit-ups, and squats?",63 days,Abilities and powers,"Saitama is the titularOne-Punch Manand the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies havesurvivedpunches from him, such as any human he has struck and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such asmechanical beingsor the mutated warriors from theHouse of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. The only opponent who has actually made him put visible effort into defeating was Garou, whose powers and abilities wereenhancedby ""God"", primarily because the former could replicate Saitama's strength. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits , his superhuman abilities are more than enough to compensate for the lack of variety in his powers. The origins of Saitama's immense strength remain a mystery. He claims to have gained his extraordinary power through mere physical training, but no one believes him.[63]According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.[63]This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and he attributes his complete hair loss to it.[63]Genos suspects that Saitama himself may not fully comprehend how he acquired his power and hopes to uncover the secret through sparring and observation,[64]while Dr. Genus theorizes that Saitama's intense regimen has allowed him to remove hislimiter.[65]It should be noted that Saitama completed all parts of his training consecutively without breaks, all while battling monsters, making the regimen even more demanding than usual. Genos beating Saitama in an eating contest. Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested byBangin a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated byKingin video games, mostly in one-sided matches.[66][67]Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest.[68]"
What does Saitama's ability to knock God's power out of its minions do?,The Fist That Defies God,Supernatural abilities,"Saitama enters Phoenix Space, a spiritual space. Non-Physical Interaction: Saitama was capable of separating his consciousness from his body to intrude on thePhoenix Space, a spiritual realm that only exists withinPhoenix Man's bird costume, and breaking a hole into it, much to the latter's confusion.[132]Before entering, Saitama somehow sensed thatChild Emperorand Phoenix Man were having a conversation inside this mental space, mistakenly assuming they were talking about his head. After leaving the Phoenix Space, Saitama's consciousness simply returned to his physical body in the same way as Child Emperor's and Phoenix Man's did.[133] Mimicry: Saitama possesses the remarkable ability to learn and replicate other techniques just by witnessing them once. Similarly to Garou, he can not only copy techniques, but also improve upon them. The sheer extent that this mimicry prowess displays is remarkably exceptional, as he was even able to copy Garou's ability to travel through time.[120] Saitama traveling through time. The Fist That Defies God: Saitama has the ability to knock ""God's"" power out of its minions. For example, Garou and Empty Void became Mysterious Beings and servants of ""God"" after receiving its power; when Saitama struck them, they were freed from this entity's influence and reverted back to being human. This led Blast to question what is special about Saitama's fists that allows him to do this, and thus he asked for Saitama's help in the future fight against ""God"".Sage Centipedehas also once referred to Saitama as ""The Fist That Has Turned Against God""."
What is Saitama's fighting style?,simple but solid,Fighting style,"Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Thanks to many fights with monsters and villains during his training, Saitama has gained a fair amount of fighting experience. Due to his immeasurable power and the resulting boredom, he usually does not focus on technique and relies on basic attacks. Unlikemartial artists, his fighting style is simple but solid, bolstered by his absolute strength. Garou comments that Saitama is an amateur fighter and has many openings to exploit. However, in hisfightagainst Garou onIo, it becomes evident that he is an exceptionally quick learner, capable of mastering any martial arts techniques after observing them only once. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, he chooses to remain a brawler, favoring simple but powerful punches over martial arts. For him, the simplicity of being a brawler is more appealing than mastering complex techniques, as his raw power and speed are more than sufficient to overwhelm his opponents. Saitama also uses karate chops,[136]and grappling moves to take down villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him. Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed hisfirst monsterby deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general; whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes up with a solution in one way or another and uses unique moves supported by his immeasurable power. Some of these instances are with hisSerious Table Flip,[137][138]and hisSerious Headbutt.[139] Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's tremendous strength and speed. Saitama usingConsecutive Normal Punches. Killer Move: Serious Series: In Serious Series, Saitama puts more effort into his attacks. His face looks more serious when he performs these ""serious"" attacks. Despite the incredible strength behind them, Saitama does not actually consider these moves to be anything special.[145] Saitama using aSerious Punch. Saitama usingOmnidirectional Serious Punch. Saitama performsSerious Table Flip."
What does Saitama do when he sees through a person's facade and understands their deepest motivations for acting the way they do?,He repeatedly proves this by reading people like Fubuki and Glasses,Miscellaneous abilities,"Keen Perception: Saitama has an uncanny ability to see through a person's facade and understand their deepest motivations for acting the way they do. He repeatedly proves this by reading people like Fubuki andGlasses. In a similar vein, he learns of King's deception quickly but opts to keep it to himself. Nonetheless, he excels at it only when he takes it seriously. He is also the first person to recognize Garou's inner turmoil and the fact that the Hero Hunter was always hoping to be a hero and not a monster.[citation needed] Power Control: Despite possessing overwhelming physical strength, Saitama has shown to have control over it. He can regulate the energy output of his punches, deciding exactly how much power to exert. This control allows him to minimize collateral damage to the environment. In spite of being capable of effortlessly obliterating powerful Dragon-level Mysterious Beings,[62]and parting clouds across the entireplanetwith his punches,[92]Saitama can still deliver strikes with just enough force to incapacitate weaker opponents, such as humans or criminals, without causing severe or life-threatening injuries to them.[159]In hisfightwith Garou onIo, an unrestrained sneeze from him mass-scattered half ofJupiter, a planet 318 times Earth's mass. It is likely that if such an involuntary action happened on Earth, he would still somehow restrain it enough to avoid catastrophic damage, since failure to do so would otherwise result in the planet's destruction. Saitama shattering Sonic's sword using his jaw. Strong Teeth: In one of his fights with Sonic, the latter attacks him with his sword, which the Caped Baldy replies to via biting and destroying the said sword with little to no effort.[70] Strong Farts: During his fight with Garou, after getting a stomachache and being sent flying away, Saitama let out an extremely strong fart that the propulsion from the said flatulence gave him enough momentum to soon catch up to the Hero Hunter.[160] Intimidation: Although he may not look very intimidating nor intelligent at first glance, those aware of Saitama's power are terrified of him. Sonic and Genos were left amazed and frightened by Saitama's ability to emit a ""powerful aura,"" which made his opponents tremble and feel under pressure.Orochialso experienced the overwhelming presence Saitama gives off duringtheir battle. When confronted by someone Saitama dislikes or finds irritating, all he has to do is threaten them with a few choice words, which leads them to cower in fear. Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[161]Through sheer willpower and effort, Saitama removed his naturallimiterand became an invincible hero. In the original webcomic, Saitama's willpower is also evident in his fight with Tatsumaki. His strength of will is directly connected to his psychic resistance.

What does Genos refer to Saitama as?,master,Personality,"Genos's serious demeanor Genos is an extremely serious character, rarely if ever making jokes. He constantly strives to become stronger and often seeks Saitama's guidance to achieve his ambitions. Since becoming Saitama's disciple, Genos shows deep reverence and protectiveness towards him, referring to Saitama as ""master."" While he both admires and envies Saitama, he still feels frustration and disbelief at Saitama's seemingly simple training regimen, which somehow resulted in extraordinary strength.[6] Occasionally, Genos acts as a comic foil to Saitama's oblivious nature. He frequently employs advanced techniques, battle strategies, and robotic upgrades to fight villains, often sustaining severe damage, only for Saitama to defeat the same enemies with a single effortless punch. Convinced that there is a secret behind Saitama's immense strength, Genos is motivated to observe him closely to uncover this mystery.[7] Initially more intense in his pursuits before meeting Saitama, Genos has become slightly calmer due to Saitama's influence, adopting a more measured approach to justice and power. He recognizes his growth when he witnesses Sweet Mask ruthlessly dispatch a group of alien prisoners, reflecting on how similarly unyielding he once was.[8]Gradually, Genos has become less serious and even curious about minor aspects of life, such as the meaning of fun.[9] Genos holds deep respect for two individuals: Saitama andDr. Kuseno, the man who saved him.[10]He extends professional respect to those who display genuine expertise, such as Bang and Bomb,[11]and tolerates individuals likeKing, whom Saitama willingly spends time with.[12]However, he exhibits jealousy towardsOvergrown Roverwhen Saitama pets the dog or calls it by name.[13][14]Genos tends to be disrespectful towards most others, particularly those who interrupt or annoy Saitama. WheneverBangorFubukicommand him or attempt to recruit Saitama, Genos interrupts and demands they get to the point. He staunchly defends his role as Saitama's disciple, actively discouraging Saitama from forming close relationships with others. This hostility extends beyond those who offend Saitama; it also includes Dr. Kuseno. Genos has even called out Saitama for calling Dr. Kuseno an old man, though he quickly apologized.[15]Genos also shows little respect for the Hero Association's authority, informingSitchthat he would have joined the Monster Association raid regardless of whether he was part of the main task force, stating that his actions are independent of the Hero Association's decisions.[16] Genos takes pride in his abilities and himself. During his battle withAwakened Cockroach, he feels frustrated for having to use instant adhesive gel, which forces him to acknowledge that there are monsters faster than he is.[17]However, his fights againstG4,Face Ripper, Awakened Cockroach, and Garou demonstrate that he values strategy alongside raw power. Before becoming a cyborg, Genos was also serious, described by ONE as a diligent and responsible boy from a young age.[18] While pursuing Bofoi, Genos reflects on the fact that he has always known Bofoi is dangerous, yet questions why he allowed him to go unchecked for so long. As he considers what clouded his judgment, memories of Saitama's casual moments flash in his mind, suggesting Saitama's influence may have played a part. However, Genos resolves not to blame Saitama or anyone else for this oversight.[19]"
How old is Genos when he meets Saitama?,"Despite his age, he possesses a considerable amount of battle experience, claiming to have defeated many evil entities and organizations before meeting Saitama.[20]However, his youth and impulsiveness occasionally hinder him, resulting in missed victories in battle.",Abilities and powers,"As an S-Class hero, Genos is undoubtedly a powerful fighter. Despite his age, he possesses a considerable amount of battle experience, claiming to have defeated many evil entities and organizations before meetingSaitama.[20]However, his youth and impulsiveness occasionally hinder him, resulting in missed victories in battle. TheVirtual Genocide System simulations showed that Genos had a 70% chance of victory against any Demon-level threat.[21]According toGyoro Gyoro, while his functionality is impressively advanced, he lacks the firepower needed to defeat something large and durable likeElder Centipede. Since that encounter, he has grown stronger and has increasingly adopted a strategic approach to combat. After two months, he has become capable enough to take on Dragon-level threats, having defeatedonesingle-handedly, which underscores his remarkable growth."

Enhanced by his cyborg physiology;,[A].,Physical abilities,"Genos breaks the ground with a dropkick Immense Strength: Enhanced by his cyborg physiology, Genos possesses incredible physical strength, and is capable of breaking apart the ground with a dropkick,[22]and punching rapidly with enough force to tear apart a cliff face.[23]He is also able to lift a truck with a single hand without difficulty.[24]During his brief fight with theDeep Sea King, he was able to land a full-force punch on the creature that sent it flying through the wall of the safety shelter.[25]In hisfight with Garou, Garou noted that his strength rivaled that ofTanktop Master.[26] Genos ""teleporting"" behind Sonic Immense Speed and Reflexes: Genos is very agile and can move so fast that he appears to be teleporting. He was able to keep up withSpeed-o'-Sound Sonicfor a considerable amount of time in their battle, with both of them moving faster thanFubukicould see.[27] Immense Endurance: Genos's body is almost completely artificial and does not have the same vulnerabilities that completely organic beings possess. In conventional terms, he does not experience fatigue since his performance and abilities are contingent on the condition of his cybernetics, the energy supply in his core, and the energy output of his core. His body is constructed from highly durable materials and can only be damaged when external forces surpass the limits of those materials. Genos can continue fighting without much drawback even with portions of his body missing. As he lacks blood or vital fluids, he is immune to blood loss, and his neural connections to his cybernetic body differ from those of normal humans, rendering him impervious to shock or its inhibiting effects. He has demonstrated the ability to fight and move even after his limbs have been torn off on various occasions. Due to most of his body being artificial, he appears to have an extremely high tolerance to injuries due to him not being able to feel pain for the most part. However, it can be inferred from the expression on his face after coming into contact with the Deep Sea King's acid spit that he is susceptible to pain caused by direct acidic corrosion on his body. Apart from this, he seldom displays significant signs of physical stress. Radiation Resistance: As a cyborg, Genos possesses a remarkable resistance to lethal radiation that can swiftly incapacitate even powerful individuals such as heroes, including those of S-Class caliber. Prolonged exposure to such radiation is ultimately fatal for them, whereas Genos can endure it without succumbing to its effects.[28]"
What is the name of Genos's cybernetic body?,Dr. Kusenogave Genos,Cyborg modifications,"Full-body Cyborg Enhancement: Genos's entire body has been replaced with combat-ready cybernetics and prostheses, giving him an extreme level of strength and speed, as well as advanced sensors and projectile attacks. All of his parts have made Genos too heavy to swim and he needs special parts in order to do so.[29]In addition to these modifications,Dr. Kusenogave Genos the ability to taste and made it so his cybernetic body turns organic intake into biofuel, presumably to power his person.[30]He has been shown eating on multiple occasions like when he engages in an eating contest with Saitama[31]and when he eats hotpot at Saitama's apartment.[32] Genos's core Core: Genos's body is powered by an energy sphere labeled ""CORE."" It is attached to his body by a single cable and is held inside his chest. During his attempt to destroy themeteor, Genos removed the core from his chest and placed it in a similar holding place in his arm, in Arms Mode, to direct all the energy into his Incineration Cannon.[33][2]Duringhis fightwith Psykos and Orochi, it transpires that the core is a nuclear reactor.[34]In addition, the core can record everything happening around it even if Genos is dead, as seen in theOminous Future.[35] Armor and Replacement Parts: Genos benefits from the nature of robotic equipment itself. He can lose limbs or have his body torn apart, only to return in perfect or even an improved condition through replacement parts and repairs. As a cyborg, Genos does not seem to feel pain to the same extent as regular humans and can keep fighting even when limbs are severed or he is severely injured. Genos's durability is high enough that despite taking several powerful blows fromCarnage Kabuto[36]and having one of his own powerful blasts reflected at him,[37]he was still conscious and able to stand and walk.[38] Cyborg Leg: Genos's legs have a durable design to support high-speed movement. They are equipped with a shock-absorbing mechanism that keeps the interval between landing and the next movement short.[2]And from hisPost-Super-Fight-Arc Upgradeonward, Genos has rocket boosters installed in his legs which allow him to perform powerful kinetic kick attacks, an example of this is hisJet Drive Arrow. Incineration Cannons: Genos's palms contain ports that allow him to fire large, powerful blasts of heat,fire, or plasma across significant distances. One blast was powerful enough to obliterate the multi-story above-ground headquarters of theHouse of Evolution, as well as the top of the mountain it was situated on and a large chunk of a mountain far in the distance behind the building.[39]HisIncineration Cannonshave varying levels of power depending on what set of arms he is currently using. For example, when utilizingArms Mode, Genos's arms can produce even stronger blasts.[40]When using hisArms for Choreshe can reduce the power of his blasts to a warm breeze to dry dishes.[41] Genos detecting approaching objects Hyper Sensors: Genos's cyborg body contains several passive and active sensors which allow him to scan the environment, such as detecting living organisms, fast approaching objects, high-energy bodies and many other anomalies, thus keeping him on guard.[2]However; the sensors are not perfect, as they can still be confused by the extreme speed of an opponent like Saitama or by certain monsters like Elder Centipede who are so large that Genos's sensors identify it as many different enemies. Their usefulness is also limited by Genos's reaction time. Instant Adhesive Gel: A tool Genos gained after his fight with Sonic to deal with opponents faster than him.[42]The gel is extremely sticky and fast-acting, preventing fast opponents from moving and allowing Genos to defeat them. Genos's arm-blades Detachable Body Parts: Genos first sported detachable and recallable arms duringhis fight with G4, where the arms were retrieved with a cable.[43]During hisfight with Garou, his hands are upgraded to be able to detach from his body with ease and are armed with rocket boosters to be controlled by Genos remotely. It is also armed with steel wire to restrain opponents.[44]Genos also reattached his torso with his lower body when he was cut in two during hisbattle against Elder Centipede.[45] Arm-Blades: Genos's arms are armed with razor-sharp blades. These debuted in hisPost-Super-Fight-Arc Upgrade. He used them to kill a number of low ranking members of the Monster Association sent to assist Garou[46][45]as well as to blind Elder Centipede during their fight, to seemingly no avail.[45] Boosters:[2]Once engaged, these boosters located in Genos' shoulders and elbows enable amazing acceleration and limitedflight. Using his palms for jet propulsion in the opposite direction, he can perform rapid maneuvers. The upgrades given to Genos by Dr. Kuseno before the Monster Association raid have given these boosters greater power, granting Genos the ability to travel upwards at great heights.[47] Arms for Chores: When not in battle, Genos can change into special arms dedicated to house chores. His right hand comes with a built-in vegetable peeler[30]and his palms also allow him to generate a warm breeze to dry dishes.[48]It was also commented that Genos could be the number one housekeeper.[49] Anti-Saitama Tactical Arms: These are a set of replacements Genos used during theNational Superhero Registry Arcwhen Genos and Saitama sparred in the quarry. These arms are differentiated from his normal arms by being black, having much larger shoulders, forearms, and fists and generating an orange glow between the plates of metal. The fists and forearms of these arms open to reveal several cannons. The beams generated by the cannons are significantly larger than those of his normal arms and are characterized by smaller individual beams circling the main beam. If he puts both of his fists together the resulting blast is massive, much larger than that of one arm.[50] Arms Mode Arms Mode: A prototype weapon system. When inactive, it takes the form of a suitcase.[51][52]To activate it, Genos pushes a button on the handle and then throws it in front of him.[53]The suitcase splits down the middle and separates, each half then opening to reveal the ""arms"" inside. The arms then clasp over Genos's arms. When the ""arms"" fully attach, parts run up his shoulders and neck and his face is framed by pieces of metal.[54]The new arms are much thicker and are all black, with the blaster on his palm having changed shape as well.[55]While using these arms, Genos was shown to be able to move his core to the bicep of his left arm, directing all of his power into a massive blast.[56]Arms Modebares a striking resemblance to Genos'sAnti-Saitama Tactical Arms, possibly alluding to the former being an upgraded version of the latter. Post-Sea-Monster-Arc Upgrade: Afterhis battleagainst Deep Sea King, Genos now has the ability to detach his limbs, namely his hands, as seen in his fight againstG4when he usedRocket Punch. His limbs are only semi-detachable as they are still connected to the main body via a cable.[57]According to the Virtual Genocide System's simulations, with this upgrade Genos would be able to defeat Mosquito Girl and Deep Sea King even in his wet form with relative ease. However, the Virtual Genocide System's simulations also show that Normal Carnage Kabuto would still beat Genos in two attacks even with the upgrade.[58] G4 Upgrade: After defeating the battle robot G4, Genos replaces his parts with the parts of G4 which enhanced his speed and power. After this upgrade the design of Genos's arms changes again. His shoulders are larger than previous upgrades with two pieces of shoulder armor on top of one another both with holes in them to allow heat to escape and slot drive screw-like joints for his shoulders to move. His arms appear as if they are wrapped in metal tape with rivets all along them going down to his wrists and he has the same slot drive screw-like joints on his elbows. His hair also received fiber enhancements to make his hair resistant to shock and heat.[59]Moreover, he is equipped with adhesive gel.[60] Post-Super-Fight-Arc Upgrade: After being heavily damaged byGouketsu, Dr. Kuseno rebuilds Genos into a new version that further increases his strength. With these upgrades, he was capable of gaining an advantage againstGarouin combat, albeit Garou was in his weakened state at the time, prompting the Hero Hunter to compliment his abilities and even comparing his physical strength to that ofTanktop Master.[61]Furthermore, Genos can now recall his body parts if they get detached.[62]Additionally, he can summon blades from his arms that he used to slice through a horde of low-level monsters during the battle against Garou.[63]He used these against Elder Centipede's exposed face later.[64]His arms also have an almost net-like ability that he used to bind Garou to a tree after his arm was ripped off.[65] Monster Association Arc Upgrade: After Genos's battle against Elder Centipede, Dr. Kuseno once again upgraded him to a new form. This upgrade features sharper, more jagged arms compared to his previous ones, with three large knife-like protrusions on each shoulder. Genos’s appearance in this form is almost demonic. Additionally, the blaster ports in his palms take the form of gaping demon mouths and there are what appear to be tubes or wires coming from each of his arms connecting to the back of his head, forming a metal framing around his face.[66]What sets this upgrade apart from others even further is its full black appearance,[67]compared to previous upgrades that were a mix of black and other colored metals, or no black at all. The armor is also arranged as overlapping plates rather than plates that abut one another. This form is unbalanced and focuses heavily on raw destructive power, as requested by Genos, following Saitama's suggestions. Dr. Kuseno noted that Genos can only utilize the full power of this new upgrade for ten seconds; exceeding this limit could cause his core to fail and explode, killing him.[68]In this form, Genos has beam emitters integrated along his arms and shoulders that he can use to attack enemies around him while he is otherwise occupied. These beams bend and arc towards his enemies similar to those of G4, indicating that Dr. Kuseno integrated the technology into this upgrade.[69]During this ten-second power burst, Genos leaves behind a blue glow while moving, resembling a blue dragon. At full power, stated by himself, Genos is capable of firing energy beams powerful enough to destroy agiant meteorin one shot. With this, he could deflect the energy attacks fromthe fused Psykos and Orochi.[70]With his ten-second last resort attack,True Spiral Incineration Cannon, Genos managed to counter and neutralize one of the fusion monster's largest energy beams. The heat generated by the attack melted the armor over his core and left his arms glowing white-hot.[71] Post-Psychic-Sisters-Arc Upgrade: At some point after the final battle with Monster Association, Genos received another upgrade from Dr. Kuseno. His appearance in this form has arms that resemble hisArms Modeand a core that is now visible on his chest. Genos claims that in this form he has enough firepower to fight Dragon-level threats.[72][73]This is proven correct as he no sooner is able to defeat the Dragon-level threat,Forest king, by himself, while Tanktop Master was helpless against it. Genos was also able to dispatch an army of forest folks almost instantly.[74]Genos gains a new ability with this upgrade calledLightning Core, which produces an extremely bright, blinding light from the core in his chest.[75]Though, no further features of this ability, if any exist, are shown as Genos soon stopped the spar after realizing that Saitama was not impressed with his strength.[76]When stopping his punch in front of Saitama, Genos was able to release a powerful shockwave, similar to Saitama's at the end of their first spar, enough to cause significant destruction in the direction of the punch.[77]Additionally, his speed has shown to increase considerably, as seen when he could keep up withFlashy Flashin combat during their short scuffle, although it is likely that the fellow S-Class hero held back his true speed.[78] With this upgrade, Genos gains two new abilities:Lightning CoreandScorching Core. The former produces an extremely bright light from his chest core,[79]while the latter generates intense heat capable of inflicting widespread damage, albeit at the cost of harming himself.[80]He managed to defeat the Dragon-level threat,The Extended Family of Darkness, by himself, though he sustained heavy damage in the process.[81]Additionally, in a previous battle, he had difficulty against a Demon-level threat, losing one arm and suffering minor damage to the rest of his body, despite emerging victorious.[82] Post-Supreme-Hero-Arc Upgrade: After sustaining heavy damage in his fight against the Extended Family of Darkness, Genos is once again repaired and upgraded with new parts courtesy of Dr. Kuseno. This new form retains the exposed chest core from his previous upgrade and features triple-layered pauldrons on his shoulders, bracers similar to his earlier form adorned with plates and rivets, and large bolts traversing his biceps. He also has a metal collar with rivets lines both sides of his neck, extending down to just below his ears. In this form, with apparent little effort, he was able to defeat a Dragon-level threat alongsideDrive Knight, sustaining no damage.[83]Upon releasing the full power state of the upgrade, which only lasts about 30 seconds, Genos was capable of engaging in combat with three Dragon-level threatsMachine God Body,Machine God RayandMachine God Techsimultaneously, even managing to quickly destroy all of them singlehandedly, though he was left with only 9% of his energy afterward.[84] Genos with the final version upgrade from Kuseno Kuseno's Final Upgrade: Before his passing, Dr. Kuseno reveals the final set of upgrades he had prepared for Genos as a secret weapon. According to Kuseno, this upgrade combines Genos' latest system enhancements, making it extraordinarily powerful.[85]In this form, Genos was able to swiftly eliminate a vast army of formidable robots fromThe Organization, using nothing but his bare hands.[86]"
How does Genos use Incineration?,"distract opponents and calculate how powerful they are, as well the exact amount of power he'll need for battle",Fighting style,"Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Thanks to his cyborg physiology and experience, Genos is one of the most proficient fighters in the series. Genos can utilize his various enhancements to distract opponents and calculate how powerful they are, as well the exact amount of power he'll need for battle and, as the series goes on, Genos improves his skills and capabilities as a cyborg. He makes use of a large variety of weaponry and upgrades in battle and is a very capable fighter in both close quarters and long-range fighting. He is skilled enough in hand-to-hand combat to fight the likes ofSpeed-o'-Sound Sonic[87]andDeep Sea King, even at a disadvantage, he could fight on par with the latter for a short time despite having just one arm.[88]However, he's still not a match for other extremely skilled fighters such asBangor Garou.[citation needed] Cybernetic Combatant: While possessing formidable combat skills, Genos however relies mostly on his advanced weaponry equipped in fights with a blend of both close and long-range depending on what he prefers. Due to his cybernetic nature, Genos usually becomes stronger by way of upgrades from Dr. Kuseno rather than training thus giving him a large advantage over other heroes, even some of the S-Class heroes, since he is always equipped with high-tech weapons when entering battles. Due to this combat nature of his, Genos can become rather unpredictable and stronger in relatively short amounts of time given that his upgrades can be installed after certain battles and defeats thus making him more formidable than before. Genos usesIncineration Genos performs theSuper Spiral Incineration Cannon Genos usesRocket Punch Genos flies down withJet Drive Arrow Tactical Combination: Promoted Rook Tactical Combination: Promoted Rook: Genos was sufficiently compatible withDrive Knightto complete aTactical Combinationwith him. Genos and Drive Knight, utilizing Drive Knight's shape-changing box, transforms into a large humanoid robot with several large thrusters and heavy armor. Genos is positioned where the head would be while Drive Knight is embedded within the chest-plates. The transformation's main weapon of choice is a giant sword with a guard shaped like a dragon's head and wings.[110]"

"How does Tatsumaki feel about being ignored or being called things like ""brat"" and ""runt""?",dislikes,Personality,"Tatsumaki telling Saitama to get out of her sight Tatsumaki has a rather brash, moody, hot-headed, and impatient personality. She is disrespectful towards most people, especially to those she deems incompetent. She is completely intolerant to those she deems impertinent, as shown when she slammedGenosinto a large piece of rubble for retaliating against her verbal abuse ofSaitama.[8]However, she did stop whenBangscolded her for her actions to him.[8]Tatsumaki especially dislikes being ignored or being called things like ""brat"" and ""runt"".[8] Despite her arrogant personality, she feels obligated to defeat monsters and considers her job as a hero to be a duty, accepting any of theHero Association's requests to defeat monsters.[9]Due to the fact that she tends to get bored when she is not fighting monsters, she also seeks monsters to fight in her own time. She has a bit of a soft side towards her little sister,Fubuki, but she is also very overprotective and controlling of her. Tatsumaki is extremely confident in her strength. During the S-Class meeting forWaganma's rescue, she claims multiple times that no monster stands a chance against her, and even takes the situation nonchalantly to a certain extent.[10] Deep down she has a strong dislike for anything that reminds her of her dark childhood past, such as despising the criminal monsters who involve kids likeTareointo dangerous hopeless situations. Due to Tatsumaki's confidence in her strength and Blast's influence, she has very independent tendencies which can lead to stubbornness as she believes that she cannot go on thinking that anyone will come and save her. This is seen as Tatsumaki refuses the help of Bang,Bomb, and Fubuki and temporarily binds them in order to prevent them from helping her. Fubuki goes as far as to describe this as a curse Blast left in her. Though despite her attitude, deep down she secretly acknowledges her dislike in everyone fearing her and wishes forBlastto one day tell her what she should do to change her current life.[citation needed] In contrast to her younger sister, her great power and confidence make her suffer from a massive superiority complex, believing that she can beat any foe if she is in top shape. In the webcomic, this is shown during the fight withGarou, when he adapts and surpasses all of her attacks, she assures him that she would not need more than five seconds if she was at her full power. Furthermore, even after trying in vain to defeat Saitama, she still asserts that she is much more powerful than him, showing her incapability to see or accept fact that someone is much more powerful than her. Her superiority complex is further explained by Fubuki from the fact that Tatsumaki never faces enemies that are more powerful than herself during her day-to-day hero activities. The superiority complex Tatsumaki has developed has prevented her from developing any humility and she has little empathy towards others. This poor self-awareness has caused her to use her power seemingly without caution or care for those around her and has often prevented her from thinking carefully about the consequences of her actions. For example, her explosive temper caused earthquakes and multiple threats that the hero association tried to respond to when she became angry at Saitama for calling her a brat and a midget. This may be part of the reason why her fellow S-Class heroes and others within the association, while very respectful of her abilities, see her as a spoiled brat and a child rather than an adult, much to her chagrin. Her poor communication skills and prideful attitude have done little to soften this initial impression and are the cause of her poor relationship with her sister. Confidence in her ability along with past trauma have made Tatsumaki extremely self-reliant, to the point she considers friendships and relationships of any kind to be of no value. She threatened to rip all the contacts and friends out of Fubuki's life calling them parasites and believing them to be the cause of her sister's slow development, though her own poor mentorship and extremely controlling nature are the more likely cause. It has also made her very dismissive of her fellow heroes and she tends to ignore any criticism from them however valid it may be. Her confidence is not baseless, as nearly no opponents have ever proven to be more than a nuisance to her. Despite her past and the terrible things people have done to her, she still chose to become a hero on her own and help others.[citation needed]She is terrible at socializing and sometimes even getting along with others, but loves her sister dearly. Because of this, Tatsumaki will do anything to make her sister stronger, even if it takes some force, though she never seems to take Fubuki's opinion into account when she does so. She always solves problems physically. As a child, Tatsumaki always thought she was the cooler one of the two; she figured this had to be true if her little sister, Fubuki, played with her all the time, although this was not the case. It was actually because the kids in their neighborhood were terrified of Tatsumaki, and it led to Fubuki getting isolated from everyone. Tatsumaki was denied any contact with her family or the outside world after being taken away, and it was because of this that she developed an overprotective nature over her sister, which led to her sister resenting her and constantly trying to separate herself from Tatsumaki. Tatsumaki's pride makes her think she is a really good sister to Fubuki, when in fact all of her actions towards Fubuki have damaged their relationship."

How does Bang feel about the negative and unhealthy hero culture of the Hero Association?,disgusted,Personality,"Bang's calm demeanor Bang appears to have a serious personality, however; his true personality is said to be surprisingly playful.[11]His demeanor is normally calm, shown when he is seemingly unperturbed by the Dragon-level meteor falling onZ-City. Unlike most other heroes, Bang prefers to be called by his name rather than his hero alias ""Silver Fang"".[12] Bang is also well-grounded in the ethics of heroism; he accuses the other S-Class heroes of being heartless for ignoring the disaster in Z-City and attending to their own problems instead. Additionally, when witnessingTanktop Black HoleaccuseSaitamaof causing the civilians' misery, Bang watches from a distance sympathetically, but without interruption, noting that heroes have to take responsibility for their actions, and will normally have to deal with the lack of appreciation for their work. Later, when his discipleCharankoconfronts Saitama by praising his martial arts master's skill and hero rank, Bang scolds his disciple not to embarrass him and states outright that Saitama is many times stronger than he is. He is also disgusted at the negative and unhealthy hero culture of the Hero Association; he reveals toAtomic Samuraiin their fishing trip that the Hero Association has lost sight of its goal.[13] Perhaps due to losing all but one of his disciples to his former top discipleGarou, Bang is always eagerly looking for new disciples to succeed him. After stating that he would not want the meteorite to fall on Z-City as it would erase his dojo, Bang quickly demonstrates hisWater Stream Rock Smashing Fist, toGenos, only to realize that the cyborg had already left. Later, he invites Saitama and Genos to his dojo to try and recruit them to his dojo. His unyieldingness to protect the citizens/civilians can be said as strategic importance in the world of heroes. He has a sense of nobility and moral integrity, thus earning respect from the other heroes.[4] Bang cares deeply for his former disciple, Garou. He fears for Garou's fate of becoming a monster, a process that seems irreversible.[14]When meeting him face-to-face once again, Bang shows utter contempt for his fallen student, spitting that he has become nothing more than an animal.[15]During their final confrontation, Bang laments how far the young man has fallen, and resolves to bring him around,[16]and train him truly again.[17] In his past, Bang was shown to be pompous, arrogant, and abrasive, very much like Garou. He would go around challenging fighters who appeared strong and constantly put them in the hospital in order to grow stronger and prove his talent.[18]Whereas his current martial art style focused on self-defense and redirecting opponent's attacks, Bang's past martial art style was geared toward destructive power, a reflection of his violent nature. He believed that his power was meant solely for enjoying himself, and was willing to fight whoever it took to make himself stronger. His arrogance and malevolence grew to the point that he was fully intending on killing his older brother during their fight. However, after having been defeated by Bomb, he became humbled, focusing on developing hisWater Stream Rock Smashing Fistas a defensive martial art and opening up a dojo to follow in his brother's footsteps.[19]Nowadays, he seems to wish to leave his older self behind and forget it completely. This is shown in his fight with Garou, as when the Hero Hunter started usingExploding Heart Release Fist, his former martial art, Bang refused to use it, despite the fact that he was being forced into a corner and using it would give him an advantage."

Even among the S-Class, his presence was exceptional.[4]He is also an outstanding martial artist and a capable martial arts teacher, having created his own martial arts style,Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist, and taught it to Garou, another adept practitioner of the style. Garou himself has also mentioned that Demon-level threats likeBug GodandRoyal Ripperpale in comparison to the elder martial artist.[20]Bang is known as an idol and treasure of martial arts, almost being like a god in the martial arts world,[21]and thus one of the most skilled and powerful martial artists in the world, despite the fact that he is past his physical prime. He andSuperalloy Darkshineare considered the twin pillars of the hero world.[22]Bang's combination of immense physical power and vast martial arts prowess makes him one of the most powerful close-range fighters in the Hero Association. His martial arts knowledge and experience enabled him to gain the upper hand against Superalloy Darkshine in a sparring match.[23]His amazing strength and combat prowess were showcased in his fight against Gums and Fuhrer Ugly, two Dragon-level Mysterious Beings, capable of overpowering them with relative ease.[24]Additionally, despite Garou's significant growth through many battles, including his transformation into a monsterized state, Bang still managed to hold his ground against the Hero Hunter for some time, putting up a fierce fight before ultimately being defeated.[25][26][27]"
What is the name of Bang's brother?,Elder Centipede,Physical abilities,"Bang causing the ground to break apart by punching Garou Immense Strength: Despite his old age, Bang possesses incredible physical strength, far beyond that of an average hero, even by S-Class standards. He has been shown to be able to destroy meteorite fragments with his bare hands.[28]Upon facingFist Fight Djinn, a Demon-level threat, Bang was able to annihilate the monster in an instant, to the shock ofSmile Man.[29]With a single punch, he was able to create a huge crater as it made contact with Garou, who was lying on the ground.[30]Combining his strength withhis brother, Bang was able to knock Elder Centipede back and destroy the enormous monster's carapace armor, which was durable enough to withstandMetal Knight'smissiles andMetal Bat's swings without a scratch.[31]AgainstGumsandFuhrer Ugly, two powerful Dragon-level Mysterious Beings, he was capable of kicking a large hole through the former,[32]and knocking down the latter in mere moments, causing heavy damage to the monsters.[33] Bang quickly annihilating Fist Fight Djinn with a barrage of strikes Immense Speed and Reflexes: Bang possesses impressive speed and reflexes, far beyond that of average heroes. He was able to follow the movements of extremely fast opponents and could not only outrun a falling spaceship but also all of the S-Class heroes present, such asAtomic Samurai, Metal Bat, andPuri-Puri Prisoner. Atomic Samurai even questioned how Bang can be so fast, despite being one of the fastest S-Class heroes himself. During a sparring match with Metal Bat, he was able to dodge and repel all of the latter's swings, as well as significantly exhaust him with little effort.[34]His immense speed allows him to deliver high-speed combos in an instant,[35][36]and run dozens of miles before tiring, being able to run much farther in his prime.[13]He was able to move faster thanDo-Scould see and incapacitate her along with many of her love slaves within mere moments.[37]When a horde ofBlack Spermclones surrounded him and Genos, Bang was capable of dispatching multiple clones in quick succession.[38] Immense Durability: Bang is very resilient.

Enhanced Stamina and Endurance: Bang possesses an amazing level of stamina. He is able to run a few dozen kilometers before getting winded, although his age has taken a toll on his stamina.[13]Throughout the course of the battle against the Monster Association, Bang was able to proceed through several fights ranging from brief to long durations, such as against Overgrown Rover,[40]Gums and Fuhrer Ugly,[41]and hordes of Black Sperm clones.[42]Despite his injuries and tiredness fighting against Garou on the surface ofZ-City, he managed to endure the pain and continue engaging with his disciple.[43]After regaining consciousness in spite of his injuries and fatigue from fighting Garou, Bang was one of the last heroes to fall to the cosmic radiation emitted from Garou, having stayed conscious long enough to talk to and confront the Hero Hunter as well as witness Blast's arrival.[44] Enhanced Senses: Bang could sense anevil presenceinside of Garou that was influencing his disciple's behavior.[45]"
What is the title of Bang's martial artist?,Greatest Treasure of Martial Arts,Fighting style,"Master Martial Artist: With decades of training and experience, Bang is one of the world's most powerful martial artists. His extensive knowledge of various martial arts enabled him to develop his own unique style, earning him the title of the ""Greatest Treasure of Martial Arts.""[46]HisWater Stream Rock Smashing Fistis much more efficient and precise than Garou's, asDarkshinehimself made the comparison after fighting the Hero Hunter, stating that compared to Bang, Garou's technique was imperfect.[47]While Garou must make a conscious effort in order to use the style, for Bang, it has become an innate part of who he is.[48]His mastery of martial arts was also displayed in a sparring match against a fellow S-Class hero, Superalloy Darkshine, whom Bang was able to avoid and deflect all attacks from,[23]as well as during his clash against Fuhrer Ugly and Gums, two powerful Dragon-level threats, in which Bang was capable of skillfully deflecting all attacks from the former and redirecting them at either itself or towards Gums.[49]In his fight with an evolved Garou, who had vastly improved his combat skills through many battles, Bang was still capable of engaging him on equal terms in hand-to-hand combat, occasionally even gaining the advantage.[50][51][52] Bang demonstratingWater Stream Rock Smashing Fist Bang usingAwakening Breath Bang showcases hisExploding Heart Release Fist Bang and Bomb performingCross Fang Dragon Slayer Fist"

For the majority of the series, he is a first year student atKarasuno High Schooland plays as the starting setter for the boys' volleyball club."
How did Kageyama feel when he joined Karasuno?,"more respectful of his upperclassmen, as well as more accepting of people whose abilities",Personality,"Perpetually sullen, arrogant, and undeniably short-tempered, Kageyama originally came off as a typical overbearing perfectionist, caring only about winning and completely disregarding the opinions and well-being of his teammates. His habit of complaining about their performance and barking orders at them eventually led the other players inKitagawa Daiichito nickname him the ""King of the Court,"" a constant reminder of the oppressive, egocentric attitude he demonstrated during his volleyball career in junior high. Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and acquaintances, however, he is much more sensitive and childish than he appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration, and hence expresses his thoughts and emotions in an inappropriate way. After everyone in Kitagawa Daiichi became fed up with him and abandoned his side, Kageyama was filled with genuine regret and developed an intense fear of being despised and mistrusted but refused to openly discuss his problem untilTsukishimaconfronted him about it. Despite his inability to properly socialize, he sincerely wishes to do his best and is extremely passionate and dedicated when it comes to volleyball, to the point where he gets overly excited about nearly every successful move he pulls off withHinata. Since joiningKarasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of his upperclassmen, as well as more accepting of people whose abilities and/or views differ from his own, and has come to once again understand the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so much. Additionally, this has also helped him regain his confidence as a setter. He has also come to realize that he doesn't call the shots on the court and has learned to give up control to Hinata and other spikers. During high school, he still gets extremely angry when he is called by his nickname, ""King of the Court"", but by the Final Arc, he has changed greatly on how he views the nickname."
How old was Kageyama when he started playing volleyball?,four years old,Background,"Even shortly after he was born, Kageyama was shown to already have a great love for volleyball when he held on dearly to his older sister's volleyball and refused to let his grandfather take it away from him[2]. When he was around four years old, Kageyama started playing volleyball with his grandfather,Kazuyo, and his older sister,Miwa. He soon found a passion for the sport and became a setter due to it being the position that got to touch the ball the most. During his time at Akiyama Elementary, Kageyama was soon recognized as a prodigy. Once he enteredKitagawa Daiichi Junior High, it was clear that his potential would be much higher than the other players on his team, including the current third-year setterTōru Oikawa. However, Kageyama's exceptional abilities and lack of consideration for others led him to develop a demanding demeanor and an inability to cooperate with his teammates, causing them to refer to him as the ""King of the Court"". Since the true meaning of this nickname was only known to the players at Kitagawa Daiichi, outsiders simply assumed that it referred to Kageyama's incredible talent. Additionally, he would often practice more than required, which his teammates,KunimiandKindaichi, would notice and judge him for and at times try to avoid. By his third year of junior high, Kageyama's attitude had already destroyed his relationship with his teammates, to the point where Kindaichi and Kunimi considered asking the coach to bench the setter. Despite the setter's lack of teamwork, Kitagawa Daiichi still managed to be a favorite to win at the Junior High Athletics Meet. It was at the tournament that he would first meet and begin his long-term rivalry withShōyō Hinata. Kitagawa Daiichi was said to have moved forward with the tournament but lost in the finals; it's hinted that Kageyama may be one of the main reasons for the loss due to his picture being on an article about the match. At some point during the junior high competitions in his third year, Kageyama sent a toss to his teammates in the middle of a game only to find no one behind him. His teammates refused to hit his tosses anymore, showing their clear desire to have him removed from the team. Kageyama was then benched and ended his final game at Kitagawa Daiichi in shame. Not long after this, Kageyama failed to enterShiratorizawaand his grandfather passed away, which was shown to be deeply affecting him and his sister, Miwa."
How many sets did Kitagawa Daiichi win?,2,Plot,"Kageyama makes his debut appearance during the middle school volleyball tournament when he arrives at the gym with his team,Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. Its first match was againstHinata's team,Yukigaoka Junior High School. Before the game began, Kageyama went to the bathroom, where he encountered Hinata being bullied by members from Kitagawa Daiichi. Kageyama coldly criticized them before turning his attention to Hinata. Despite Kageyama's mocking of Hinata's lack of height and overly idealistic ambition, Hinata wasn't fazed and challenged Kageyama instead, surprising and irritating the latter. Kageyama accepted angrily before leaving. As expected, Kitagawa Daiichi easily overwhelmed Yukigaoka, but Hinata remained determined. Kageyama admired Hinata's high jumps, overall athletic abilities, and determination, but didn't change his poor opinion of the wing spiker. In the end, Kitagawa Daiichi won both sets . As the teams lined up, Kageyama angrily asked Hinata what he had been doing for the past three years before getting called away. Afterward, as they were leaving, Hinata ran up to Kageyama and vowed to defeat him next time they faced each other."
Who is the vice-principal?,"Daichi,Sugawara, and Tanakaare",Karasuno high team formation arc,"Hinata and Kageyama encounter each other again at Karasuno. Kageyama arrives at the second gymnasium early and practices serves[3]. Suddenly, the door slams open andHinatarushes in, loudly asking Kageyama why he's here too. Kageyama recognizes Hinata but doesn't remember his name, prompting the latter to reintroduce himself. Hinata states that Kageyama has probably already forgotten him, but Kageyama denies it, thinking back to Hinata's reflexes, jumping power, and speed. Kageyama instead insults Hinata, leading to an argument. Hinata asks Kageyama why he's here and Kageyama reveals solemnly that he didn't get into the best school in the prefecture. Hinata wonders how since Kageyama's the King of the Upper Court and Kageyama yells at Hinata before getting interrupted by the upperclassmen. Daichi,Sugawara, andTanakaare walking in while talking about Kageyama. They greet Kageyama and talk to him a bit. Hinata loudly greets the third years and Tanaka, taking the attention of Kageyama momentarily. They compliment Hinata for his performance last year and he exclaims that he'll become Karasuno's ace. This causes Kageyama to insult him, reminding him to not waste another three years again. Daichi tries to stop the argument, but the first-year's ignore him, too engrossed in their fight. The vice-principal then comes in and the upperclassmen try to cover up the situation, but Hinata and Kageyama end up challenging each other to a mini-match. Hinata exclaims that he's not the same as last year and Kageyama replies with the same words and smiles excitedly, surprising Hinata. The match begins and Kageyama does a jump serve that Hinata avoids at the last moment. Kageyama asks if this behavior is any different from last year's and Hinata asks for another try without any hesitation. Kageyama serves again but to his surprise, Hinata moves quickly to where the ball goes. However, the ball bounces off his arms and then his face before flying towards the vice principal. It knocks the vice principal's wig off, silencing everyone in the gym. Coldly, the vice principal asks Daichi to go outside for small talk as Kageyama and Hinata watch on. Hinata and Kageyama are kicked out of the gym. When Daichi returns, he rounds everyone up and begins lecturing the first years before getting cut off by Kageyama. The setter criticizes Hinata and blames him for everything and Daichi interjects coldly. He explains Karasuno's goals to go to Nationals before asserting that he doesn't want any players on his team who would fight with one another. He then throws the two first years out. They aren't allowed to join until they begin to view each other as teammates. Hinata begs to be let back in while Kageyama stays silent initially. After coming to terms with his situation, he pushes Hinata aside as he claims that he'll be able to work with the latter. Daichi opens the door and asks if he's sure. However, Kageyama replies sheepishly that with Hinata's current skill level, he would rather take on all the roles by himself than work with Hinata. Daichi laughs and asks Kageyama how he would be able to do that in a game where teamwork is so essential. The two remain outside the gym. After a while, Kageyama storms away, wondering what he would do since he can't see Hinata as a teammate. He announces arrogantly that he has the potential to make Karasuno better so he has to be allowed on the team. He then proposes to challenge the upperclassmen to a 2-on-2 match. He adds that he doesn't want to be on the same team as Hinata, but they have to cooperate to join. Hinata agrees after thinking it over. Later on in the evening, as the Karasuno members are cleaning up, Hinata and Kageyama announce their challenge. Secretly, Kageyama still refuses to work with Hinata and may have been planning on winning the game with serves and dump shots only. Daichi sternly asks them if they had considered the possibility of them losing and Kageyama replies that they'll take any punishment. Daichi agrees and changes the match to a 3-on-3 with the duo against the other two first-years. Tanaka is placed on the duo's team while Daichi joins the other one. However, if the duo loses, as long as the third years are around, Kageyama will never get to play as the setter. A shocked Kageyama tries to reason as Daichi reminds him of his selfish behavior from junior high. Despite Daichi telling him that he can join the club as another type of player, Kageyama exclaims that he is a setter only. Daichi replies that it'll be okay as long as Kageyama wins, and the latter accepts begrudgingly. Kageyama leaves angrily with Hinata trailing behind him. The latter remarks that even if Kageyama isn't the setter, he'll be able to play as a regular anyway and exclaims that spikers are cooler than setters anyway. This annoys Kageyama, who grabs Hinata and exclaims that a setter is the team's leader since he is the one who handles the ball the most in a match. Hinata timidly responds that setters just seem boring to him and calming down, Kageyama explains the speed at which the setter tosses the ball and how he opens the path for the spiker. Hinata still doesn't seem to understand that well, but Kageyama drops the subject. Just as they begin worrying about where to practice, they hear Tanaka discreetly telling them what time morning practice is, allowing them to come up with a plan. They then both leave as they decide to come at 5:00 AM tomorrow. The next day, they arrive to find the door locked. Tanaka then appears with the key and they begin to practice. However, Hinata has trouble receiving and Kageyama easily loses his temper[4]. Tanaka starts to lecture them, but the door suddenly opens, scaring the three. Sugawara appears and offers to help. Kageyama continues training with Tanaka as Hinata goes to Sugawara, but Hinata's dissatisfied by this arrangement and pesters Kageyama for a toss. Kageyama blatantly refuses because of Hinata's low skills and reveals that he's planning on only using Tanaka during the match on Saturday. He tells Hinata to just focus on not dragging the team down, angering the latter. Hinata asks if Kageyama will toss to him if he can receive the ball properly and Kageyama replies that he will only if it's necessary because he doesn't see Hinata as essential to helping him win. Sometime later during the school day, Kageyama goes to buy a drink from a vending machine outside and sees Hinata and Sugawara talking. He's surprised to see Hinata practicing even during his lunch break and eavesdrop on the two. Hinata expresses his desire to become stronger than Kageyama so he can then defeat other strong players and after considering the former's words, Kageyama leaves quickly. For the next few days, the two practices together wherever they can and Hinata seems to improve, but Kageyama still refuses to toss to him. At one point, Kageyama exhausts Hinata with his continuous spikes, but Hinata refuses to back down. Angrily, Kageyama spikes a ball to the back of the gym and despite being at his limits, Hinata runs to it and saves it. As it's sent back to Kageyama, the setter remembers all the things he said to Hinata before getting into a tossing position. To everyone's surprise, Kageyama sends a toss to Hinata, who happily spikes it. Kageyama then walks over to the shorter first year and states that they're going to win on Saturday, finally acknowledging him as a teammate. Sometime later, the two are practicing outside when the ball gets stuck in a tree. Hinata climbs the tree while Kageyama yells at him and tries getting the ball with a stick. Annoyed, Hinata calls Kageyama a damn King, angering the latter, but Kageyama doesn't retort. Tsukishima mocks Kageyama. They end up practicing into the night and are soon interrupted byTsukishimaandYamaguchi, the other first-years. Tsukishima takes the ball and teases Hinata before turning his attention to Kageyama. He brings up Kageyama's past with Kitagawa Daiichi and offers to throw the game so Kageyama and Hinata could win. The setter darkly replies that either way, they're going to win. Tsukishima then continuously calls him a King before reminding him of a game during his junior high days. Kageyama angrily grabs the blond but lets him go after a few seconds of silence. He then storms away, and Tsukishima insults him even more. Kageyama stops himself from hitting Tsukishima. Having enough, Hinata jumps up and grabs the ball out of the blond's hands, shocking everyone. He exclaims that he'll defeat Tsukishima, who laughs at him before leaving. Kageyama walks away too, yelling at Hinata that they'll beat the other two. The next day, both teams prepare for the match. Tsukishima brings up Kageyama's past with Kitagawa Daiichi while the latter ignores him, though Kageyama's shaken up. However, to his surprise, Tanaka comes to his defense. The match begins shortly[5]. Hinata has trouble spiking past Tsukishima while Kageyama decides to use his powerful serves. To his surprise, Daichi's able to receive them perfectly. Before the first year can plan another attack, Tsukishima starts teasing him again and reveals that Kageyama's former teammate gave him the nickname ""King"" as a reference to his egocentric playing style. He reminds the setter of his last game, when his teammates abandoned him, refusing to go after his toss. As a result, Kageyama was benched. Having enough, Kageyama reveals that that experience when no one came to him frightens him. Before he can continue though, Hinata interrupts and says that it's only a thing of the past because Kageyama has him now. The match continues and Kageyama's about to spike to Tanaka until Hinata comes from behind and calls him. Kageyama instinctively tosses to him, even though Hinata has trouble spiking from that angle. Just as Kageyama begins yelling at Hinata, the latter stops him and tells him how he was behind the setter. Hinata exclaims that Kageyama's past doesn't matter to him and he'll hit any ball Kageyama gives him. Motivated, Kageyama tosses to Hinata again and inadvertently performs a quick with him. An impressed Tanaka asks them about it, but Kageyama replies that he has no intention of performing quicks with someone he's not in sync with. Hinata gets annoyed and Tsukishima takes the chance to insult him again, bringing up his lack of height. Solemnly, Hinata acknowledges that fact and reiterates how he would always get blocked no matter how high he jumped. However, the Small Giant had the same predicament, and he overcame that, inspiring Hinata to do the same. Hinata's words remind Kageyama of his troubles with Kitagawa Daiichi and how he was ultimately benched, motivating him to finally act like a true setter to Hinata. He tells Hinata to just go for his toss without thinking and Hinata excitedly agrees despite barely understanding the strategy. Kageyama and Hinata have trouble synchronizing initially. As expected, the first few quick strikes fail. Exasperated, Kageyama yells at Hinata to move faster but Sugawara interrupts, pointing out that Hinata's ability is being diminished by Kageyama's toss. The best way for the two of them to synchronize is if Kageyama adjusts to Hinata's abilities and limits. The quick strike succeeds. Kageyama thinks over Sugawara's words and decides to try out the third year's idea. He tells Hinata to use his highest jump and his best speed and Kageyama will get the ball to him. They get into position and Kageyama concentrates on finding the best angle. At the perfect timing and height, he tosses the ball right into Hinata's palm. The quick strike succeeds, but Kageyama's shocked to find out that Hinata had his eyes closed the entire time. Still, it shows how much Hinata trusts him, motivating Kageyama to try the quick again. The next quick fails and Kageyama realizes that adjusting to another player's tempo isn't easy, but he's starting to have fun. He tries another quick, but with a different strategy with Hinata going towards the opposite side just in time to trick the blockers. It succeeds and soon, they're able to overwhelm Tsukishima's team. In the end[6], Hinata and Kageyama's team win, securing their admission in the team. The two hands in their papers just as Kiyoko comes in with the team jackets. Now officially part of the team, the two head right to practice for future matches. Just then, the club advisor,Takedarushes in, announcing a practice match againstAoba Johsai, one of the prefecture's top four teams. Kageyama's excited until he hears that he would have to play as the main setter for the entire match. The other members are outraged, wondering if Aoba Johsai only agreed to play with them because of Kageyama. However,Sugawaraagrees to the terms, surprising Kageyama. Despite being excited to be on his first official match on the team, Kageyama seeks out Sugawara to apologize for taking his spot this time and vows to earn it properly for the next match. Sugawara agrees to the challenge but asks Kageyama how he feels about Aoba Johsai since most of his former teammates will be there. Surprisingly, Kageyama doesn't have any problems with it. On the day of the match, Karasuno arrives at Aoba Johsai, and Kageyama wanders off with Tanaka, Yamaguchi, and Tsukishima. They encounterKindaichi, who mocks Kageyama. However, Kageyama doesn't retort and simply walks away. Kageyama gets angry after Hinata serves into the back of his head. The match begins and Hinata's immediately overwhelmed. Kageyama gets flustered dealing with Hinata's mistakes and the insults from Kindaichi and Kunimi. The problems reach a climax when Hinata serves right into the back of Kageyama's head. Daichi instantly reaches out to Kageyama, but the first-year coldly replies that he's fine. He walks to Hinata silently as the latter backs away in fear. Right as Hinata hits the wall, Kageyama questions his anxiety, emphasizing his words by smacking his head. He finishes by yelling at Hinata to get back into the game, surprising the latter, who was expecting a harsher punishment. The two first-years try out their quick strike, but it fails the first time. Kindaichi tells Hinata that Kageyama's bound to yell at him again, but Kageyama apologizes for the poor toss instead. The second attempt at a quick strike succeeds and Kageyama announces that they're going to start a counterattack now. Karasuno does well initially, but Kageyama notes thatYahabaisn't the regular setter[7]. Just after the realization,Oikawaarrives and Kageyama reveals that he's his former upperclassman and an extremely skilled player. With Oikawa on the team, Aoba Johsai quickly regains its points, but Karasuno wins with the first years' quick strike in the end. Kageyama tries to apologize to Kindaichi. After the match, Kageyama approaches Kindaichi in the bathroom. Before he can say anything, Kindaichi shouts at him for not apologizing, reasoning that everything that'd happened is already part of the past. To him, Kageyama's still the oppressive king and the person he wants to defeat no matter what so next time, he will win the match. Kageyama accepts and replies with: ""We will win,"" shocking Kindaichi as Kageyama had never used such an inclusive pronoun before. Before Karasuno heads home, Oikawa meets them at the gate. He points out the players' mistakes before focusing on Kageyama, announcing that he's going to crush him in a regular game. After the team returns to the school, Kageyama heads home with the others. Tanaka questions why Kageyama's at a school like Karasuno anyway and the latter replies that Shiratorizawa rejected him, much to Tsukishima's amusement. Kageyama adds that no matter which school he's at, the opponents are still high schoolers so there's no reason they can't win. His confidence causes Hinata and Tanaka to laugh at him. The next day, Kageyama's practicing his serve aim when Hinata gets in his way. As Hinata runs to get the ball, Kageyama serves again. This time, it's received perfectly by a stranger. The upperclassmen then arrive and introduce the two toNishinoya, a second year and the team libero[8]. Kageyama and Hinata meet Nishinoya. Nishinoya asks Kageyama what junior high he's from and he replies with Kitagawa Daiichi. After Nishinoya talks about how he'd lost to that team once, Kageyama asks him why he came to Karasuno when he's from a champion team as well. Nishinoya responds gravely that he came for the girls' uniforms, leaving Kageyama speechless. Nishinoya then asks ifAsahireturned, but when he finds out he didn't, the libero storms out of the gym, leaving Kageyama curious about Karasuno's past. Later that evening, Nishinoya returns thanks to Hinata's coaxing to teach the first-year's how to receive. However, Kageyama's the only one to understand the language and Tanaka snaps that when Kageyama tries to explain things, no one understands him either. The next day, Hinata and Kageyama approach Asahi at his classroom and are introduced to the former ace. They're surprised when they realized that Asahi has no intention of returning to the team, even after Hinata's appeals. Kageyama asks Sugawara about the past and Sugawara reveals the match last year that traumatized Asahi. Kageyama listens but notes that he doesn't think Asahi truly hates volleyball. Later on, during practice, the team finds out about a training camp and a practice match against Karasuno's fated rival at the end of it. During a break, Hinata remarks that if Asahi comes back, the team's morale would be a lot better. Kageyama replies that Asahi needs to understand that he doesn't need to bear all the responsibility because no one can win on his own. To this, Hinata brings up Kageyama's former attitude towards teamwork, leading to a small scuffle. The next day, the two of them approach Asahi again. Hinata yells that without Asahi, the upperclassmen aren't happy, and Asahi responds that he can't get over the image of being blocked so many times. Hinata sympathizes with him but adds that he isn't like that anymore because he's found a way to get past that with Kageyama's help. When Hinata explains his jealousy of Asahi's height and ability, Kageyama stares at him silently before taking him away. As he leaves, Kageyama adds that Asahi can't win alone so he has to rely on his teammates; this is something he'd just learned so he can't criticize Asahi too much for it. That evening,Keishin Ukai, is introduced to the team as a temporary coach and the players get ready for a practice match against the Neighborhood Association. Sugawara chooses to play on the association's side and Kageyama states that he doesn't want this to be Sugawara standing down; he'll rather fight for the position rightfully. Sugawara solemnly explains that he was afraid of competing for his position with Kageyama, but at the same time, he was relieved because he was always afraid of tossing a ball that would be blocked. But he's joining the other side, not for that, but so he could toss again to Asahi and get past those obstacles. Kageyama encourages Hinata to accept his position as a ""decoy."" The match begins and Kageyama and Hinata impress everyone with their quick. Sugawara hesitates on sending another toss to Asahi, but Kageyama shouts at him to keep trying. Sugawara and Asahi do well and Hinata starts getting restless. He announces that it's time for him and Kageyama to show their skills as well. The quicks work well initially, but Kageyama starts noticing that Hinata's being distracted by Asahi's abilities. This culminates in Hinata getting knocked over by Asahi's spike and forced to face Kageyama's rage. Kageyama yells at Hinata for being jealous of Asahi and Hinata argues back that someone tall like Kageyama wouldn't understand. The match restarts, but it's tense between the two. Suddenly, Kageyama announces to the opponents that he'll be setting to Hinata. He then turns to the middle blocker and explains that right now, he lacks all the traits for being an ace, but as long as he's here, Hinata's the strongest. With that said, Kageyama tries the quick again, but with Hinata dodging. It succeeds and Kageyama reminds him that he's just as valuable to the team as an ace. Finally accepting his position, Hinata replies that he doesn't think being the ultimate decoy is lame anymore[9]. In the end, the association wins and Asahi and Nishinoya return to the team. Kageyama's number 9 jersey. The Golden Week begins and Karasuno busily prepares[10]. Kageyama runs early in the morning and starts asking his teammates to practice with him so he can be accustomed to individual toss styles. The starting lineups finally decided with Kageyama as the official setter. The members receive their new jerseys and Hinata gets annoyed when he realizes that Kageyama's number is lower than his. Kageyama admonishes him and notes that he should be grateful for being a starter in his first year. That evening, they're in their room when Kageyama notices Hinata's intense concentration. He quickly reminds him to not overwork himself and Hinata retorts that he isn't going to. Kageyama leaves it in the end. Karasuno andNekomameet the next day and Kageyama approaches Hinata when he realizes that he knowsKenma. Hinata introduces him as Nekoma's setter and Kageyama immediately becomes interested, intimidating Hinata with his intense competitiveness. The match soon begins and Kageyama's immediately annoyed when Inuoka remarks that he isn't underestimating Hinata. The duo performs a quick right away and scores easily. The subsequent quicks succeed, but Kageyama starts to notice that Inuoka seems to be keeping up. Kageyama keeps his calm initially and goes for a spike, announcing to Hinata afterward what type of attack it was. However, Inuoka is able to catch up and block Hinata ultimately, shocking Kageyama[11]. He quickly recovers his composure and reminds Hinata to not let it get to him, but the duo continuously gets blocked after that. Just as Kageyama's worried that Hinata would be pressured, he's surprised to see him smile. Hinata reasons that he's excited to have a rival like Inuoka and asks Kageyama to toss to him again. Kageyama replies affirmatively. The next toss, Hinata opens his eyes but misses. Immediately, Ukai calls a timeout and asks Kageyama to change his toss in hopes of changing Hinata's attack. Though it should be difficult for normal setters, Kageyama replies confidently that he'll do it. Hinata misses the ball in the beginning, but their reactions improve over time. The first success goes out, however. Nekoma subs in Kuroo, who looks at Kageyama and Hinata. Immediately, Kageyama becomes cautious and pulls Hinata aside, nothing that their new attacks won't work against Kuroo. For the rest of the game, Kageyama plays carefully, choosing to toss to Asahi instead in case Hinata would get blocked again. It's only at the last point does he toss to the middle blocker using the new attack. It succeeds, only for Kenma to send the ball back. It lands on Karasuno's court, winning the game for Nekoma. Kageyama showers Kenma with questions. As the teams are cleaning up, Kageyama watches Kenma intensely, trying to gauge his abilities and unintentionally scaring the second-year setter into running away. Afterward, Karasuno goes homes, and Kageyama remarks to Hinata that if this was a regular game and they'd lost, they would've been eliminated from the competition. As he says this, he thinks back to his time in Kitagawa Daiichi[12]."
Who does Kageyama glare at when he glares at a few guys who called him by his nickname?,Karasuno,Interhigh arc,"Back at Karasuno, the players prepare for Interhigh. Kageyama listens as Ukai names the strongest opponents for them and wonders if Date Tech is the reason for the tension between the upperclassmen. When he discovers that he would face Date Tech and Aoba Johsai, he grins in excitement. Kageyama races to school on the first day of Interhigh, speeding past Hinata and increasing his wins to thirty-one. Hinata admits that it's thirty-two because, around this time last year, Kageyama beat him in the tournament. He then stands up and challenges Kageyama again[13]. Karasuno soon arrives at the stadium, where it overhears a couple of players insulting them. Though the members loom over them, they don't do anything and proceed to head inside. As they pass, Kageyama glares at a few guys who called him by his nickname. At the gym, the players are warming up when Aoba Johsai comes by. Oikawa greets Kageyama and Hinata as the former glares cautiously. The match against Tokonami begins and Kageyama's completely calm, as opposed to Hinata. For the first attack, Kageyama sends the ball to Tanaka to scare the opponents. Karasuno easily overwhelms Tokonami, especially when the quick with Hinata is used. In the end, Karasuno wins the first match[14]. Kageyama yells at Hinata for spacing out while cleaning up and Hinata remarks that they won. Kageyama's confused initially but responds that they have another match to play now. Hinata happily exclaims that they can continue to stand on the court as Kageyama watches, silently agreeing with him. As Karasuno's resting before the next match, Kageyama notices Hinata's exhilarated face. After catching Kageyama's stare, Hinata hastily defends himself, but Kageyama smirks darkly instead. He happily states that it's fine for Hinata to be noticed because the opponents would be more distracted. When Hinata replies that he doesn't understand, Kageyama grabs his head. Sometime later, the two are practicing outside when Hinata mentions Date Tech and its past with the upperclassmen. Suddenly, Sugawara approaches them. To their surprise, Sugawara bows and asks them to defeat Date Tech with their strengths as the ultimate decoy and superior setter. The match against Date Tech soon begins. Kageyama's thrown off by Aone's high jump and the possibility of his stopping Hinata. However, he recovers easily and isn't fazed when Aone does block Hinata, confident that Hinata will score. He turns to Hinata and smirks, stating that he'll get the ball to him. The two try their quick strike the next turn and easily succeeds. They continue with their attacks and Date Tech becomes focused on Hinata, according to plan. Taking advantage of this, Kageyama waits for the right moment as the opponents rush to Hinata to send a toss to Asahi for a back pipe attack[15]. Hinata admits to Kageyama that though he didn't score, he still feels just as satisfied. Kageyama affirms that the strongest decoy is just as good as an ace. In the end, Karasuno wins with Asahi's spike. After Asahi calls his teammates heroes, Kageyama listens happily before they head off the court. Hinata walks beside him and notes that their opponents didn't notice their signals. Back at home, Karasuno prepares for the match against Aoba Johsai. Kageyama thinks of the practice match against Aoba Johsai until Hinata interrupts him. The middle blocker exclaims that they'll defeat the Grand King and Kageyama agrees, noting that they have to defeat Oikawa to move forward[16]. The day of the match comes, and Oikawa picks out Kageyama instantly. As Oikawa challenges him, Hinata jumps in and yells that they won't lose. The match starts and Oikawa goes for a spike, surprising Kageyama. He responds with a quick strike and later, a surprise dump shot. As he recovers, Kageyama remarks to Hinata that though Oikawa has stronger overall power, Kageyama won't lose as a setter. However, Kageyama starts noticing that some of the opponents seem to be playing better than they did in the practice match. Things get worse when Oikawa suddenly remarks that he's finally understood, and Aoba Johsai calls for a timeout. As Oikawa explains to his teammates, Kageyama suspects that he figured out the signals to his quick. Noticing his tension, his teammates quickly tease him and remind him of his skills. Though Kageyama recovers his composure for a moment, he quickly becomes stressed again once his quicks start getting blocked. He becomes hyperaware and continuously messes up his serves and tosses until Karasuno calls for a timeout. Kageyama apologizes for losing his cool, but Ukai reminds him to focus not on Oikawa, but Aoba Johsai instead and to remember that he has a team as well. However, the match still turns into Kageyama battling Oikawa to see who the better setter is. After losing to Oikawa at pushing the ball over the net, Kageyama starts to get frustrated and makes more mistakes. In the end, Kageyama's switched out. As he heads to the bench, Hinata suddenly screams that he'll be the one to defeat Kageyama. Kageyama recovers and responds that the match isn't over yet, so he hasn't lost yet[17]. As he rests, he observes Sugawara in play. During a break, the two setters converse on Aoba Johsai, and Sugawara admits that having a strong setter like Kageyama waiting behind him is a relief. He'll fight Aoba Johsai in his way and Kageyama will find a way to fight as well. Hinata then jumps in and asks if Kageyama's depressed. Angrily, Kageyama replies that when he gets back in, he'll make Hinata spike balls like crazy. The match progresses evenly, and Kageyama starts getting restless. He gets switched back in and approaches his teammates silently. Without warning, he smiles darkly, scaring Hinata. He goes up to serve, noting that the ball feels good in his hands, and scores right away[18]. Tanaka gives him a high-five, surprising Kindaichi and Kunimi, before Kageyama goes to compliment Hinata. When Tsukishima gets switched in, Kageyama reluctantly asks him what type of toss he prefers, shocking everyone. Though his social skills are rough, it's obvious that Kageyama's trying now. It's at the final match now. Hinata rushes back into the game at full power and scores with a broad attack. Kageyama tosses to Asahi for a pipe attack but notes that Hinata's performance as a decoy is so skilled that he almost sent the ball to him instead[19]. Both sides are evenly matched, but Kageyama starts noticing his former teammates playing better. As he remembers his time at Kitagawa Daiichi and compares Kunimi and Kindaichi to the way they are now, he starts to despair, wondering how Oikawa's able to bring out that much potential. Just then, Sugawara calls for his attention, reminding him that he has his comrades at Karasuno. Despite his newfound confidence, his final toss to Hinata ends up being blocked. Karasuno fails to receive the ball and Aoba Johsai wins[20]. While resting outside, Kageyama apologizes to Hinata. The middle blocker angrily grabs him and yells that it wasn't a mistake to toss to him. Takeda interrupts them and adds that this defeat is just a trial to overcome. If they remain on their knees, they'll never win. Fully understanding their situation, the two rise up. Karasuno heads to a restaurant to cool off. After Ukai gives a brief speech of encouragement, the players start eating tearfully. Back in school the next day, Kageyama is shown to be greatly affected by the loss againstSeijohand goes to the gym to release his frustration.Hinatacomes in a while later and joins him in the practice. After Hinata points out that the final round of the tournament is taking place that day, the middle blocker starts screaming and running around the gym. Kageyama joins him a second later. As they cool off, Kageyama remarks that he's not going to apologize anymore and that he has to throw a toss that he won't have to apologize for. Sometime later, the players are gathered aroundUkaias he explains that Aoba Johsai lost toShiratorizawain the finals. Despite hearing the team they lost to was also beaten, Kageyama and his teammates are still determined to make it to the Spring Tournament."
Who does Kageyama ask to study the Shiratorizawa team?,Ushijima,Tokyo expedition arc,"Karasunoeagerly agrees to the training camp but some become nervous whenTakedamentions the need to pass final exams. Kageyama is shocked to hear that supplementary exams will be held for all those who fail and goes silent, seemingly not breathing as well. As a result, the upperclassmen agree to help him,Hinata,TanakaandNishinoyaprepare for their exams. Before they begin studying, Hinata suggests to Kageyama that they askTsukishimafor help and Kageyama reluctantly accepts after some persuasion. Kageyama initially has trouble memorizing certain things, but whenDaichiinterferes and quizzes him on volleyball signals, Kageyama shows perfect memory and notes that he memorized everything the same day he was taught. Daichi then remarks that Kageyama now has no reason to claim that his memory is bad. Sometime later, Kageyama and Hinata are leavingYachi's apartment when Hinata notices that they're nearShiratorizawa Academy. As they mention it,Ushijimaappears behind them[21]. Kageyama approaches him and, without warning, asks to study the Shiratorizawa team. Ushijima agrees, but remarks that they can come if they can keep up with him and that it wouldn't matter if Kageyama and Hinata examined his team. Easily provoked, the two follow him as he makes his way back to campus and surprise Ushijima in that they can easily keep up with him while arguing. After arriving at Shiratorizawa, Kageyama introduces himself and adds that he failed to get into Shiratorizawa. However, Ushijima remarks that he expected that since their team doesn't need a setter that can't devote himself to the ace. Kageyama gets angry but is distracted by Hinata's comments in agreeing with some of Ushijima's statements. The two bring upOikawaand Ushijima adds that Oikawa should've gone to Shiratorizawa since he is the type of setter who can bring out the maximum potential of his spikers. After Ushijima insultsAoba Johsai, Hinata becomes serious, unnerving Kageyama as well. A stray ball suddenly comes towards them and as Ushijima reaches for it, Hinata jumps ahead of him and grabs it before challenging him by Kageyama's side. Kageyama adds that Oikawa may be the strongest in the prefecture according to Ushijima, but he intends to surpass that. As the two leave, Kageyama states that they possibly can't beat Shiratorizawa the way they are and that going to the training camps may be their best way to get stronger. Sometime later, the test scores come out and Kageyama and Hinata are revealed to have failed their exams. Despite that, they have no intention of missing the first training camp and are still planning on getting to Tokyo no matter what.Tanakathen steps in and reveals that his sister could drive them after supplementary lessons. Thanks to this, they're able to pass their make-up exams and get to Tokyo; albeit a little late. With Kageyama and Hinata here, Karasuno is finally able to start winning practice games. After the first night of the camp, Hinata starts changing. He approaches Kageyama and states that he's going to stop closing his eyes during their special quick attack[22]. Kageyama refuses to change the attack but calms down and explains that he has no intention of tossing to someone who will miss. The two go outside withSugawaralater. Hinata explains that he wants to fight on his own, but Kageyama replies that the quick strike is Hinata's greatest weapon and changing it could be fatal. When they return to Karasuno, Hinata approaches Kageyama and asks for a few sets. They try out letting Hinata attempt to spike with his eyes open, but it fails every time. When he demands more sets, Kageyama angrily argues that they only need their already perfected quick strike and should work on other things, but Hinata refuses to back down. When Kageyama mentions that he'll only toss to him if he is essential to victory, Hinata attacks him and the two start fighting, forcing Yachi to findTanakato separate them. The next day, Kageyama goes to the Lil' Tykes Volleyball class in hopes of getting advice, only to encounterOikawa. Kageyama tries to ask Oikawa for advice, but the latter brushes him off. Swallowing his pride, Kageyama bows before Oikawa and loudly pleads for his help. Oikawa finally accepts only after taking a photo of Kageyama bowing to him and, after hearing the situation between the two first-years, remarks that Kageyama's acting like a dictator by refusing Hinata's request. He adds that Hinata's the one who has control of the quick attack and not Kageyama, surprising the younger setter with this revelation. Not long after his talk with Oikawa, he's approached byUkaiwho brings him into his shop to discuss a new type of set that would allow Hinata to have more control while in the air. Ukai states that Kageyama should change his toss to one that would momentarily float in the air while at its peak and thus give Hinata more attacking possibilities. Remembering his conversation with Oikawa, Kageyama agrees to give this new set a try. Kageyama starts practicing on his own in the evening while Hinata continues with his own practice withIkkei Ukai. During the second training camp atShinzen High, Kageyama begins to deliver the new set to Hinata. After several failed quick attempts, Hinata and Kageyama notice the changes the other is going through. During a match againstNekoma, Kageyama sees how frustrated Hinata has gotten from not having been able to land any decent spikes. He subconsciously sent Hinata an easier set but was promptly called out by the middle blocker. Seeing that Hinata had been right about the set, Kageyama realizes that he had done this from being concerned about Hinata not playing well. That evening, he states to Hinata that he will not be practicing with him until he can perfect the new set. Kageyama is eventually able to figure out how to make his new set work by using visualization. It would be during Karasuno's final match of the camp againstFukurōdanithat Kageyama would finally send Hinata the new set. When the new quick works, the two first-years happily celebrate before Kageyama suddenly scolds Hinata for not giving him any warning beforehand and Yachi happily celebrates how the two were now able to get past their earlier fight. Despite their best efforts, Karasuno would lose to Fukurōdani but took their loss with the knowledge that all of their new attacks were proving to work against stronger opponents. After leaving the training camp, Kageyama trains for Spring High with the former Coach Ukai and Hinata or by jogging on his own[23]."
Where does Kageyama meet Kiyoomi Sakusa?,Ajinomoto National Training Center,Tokyo nationals arc,"Kageyama tells Hinata that he's going ahead. After their victory against Shiratorizawa, Karasuno is seen preparing for Nationals, and retaking their measurements is the first step. Kageyama excels at the top among his teammates in jumping reach[31].Hinatafrustratingly challenges him for more, but Kageyama ends up beating him completely, much to Hinata's dismay. Just then,Takedacomes rushing at the gym with a big announcement in tow, informing the team that Kageyama is invited to the All-Japan Youth Camp. Karasuno is both shocked and ecstatic for Kageyama. The latter accepts the invitation and mockingly bids the jealous Hinata farewell, as he is continuing to move further ahead than him. Later on, Kageyama prepares for his trip to the National Youth Training Camp with Takeda. As the days until the camp creep by, he is also seen practicing overtime with Hinata. While commuting to the camp, Kageyama finds himself lost in Tokyo Station and takes out the directions that Takeda wrote him. However, he struggles with reading the kanji without furigana spellings. Despite this, Kageyama eventually makes it to the Ajinomoto National Training Center, where he is soon confronted by none other thanKiyoomi Sakusa. Sakusa realizes that Kageyama is from Karasuno High School, and remarks that that was the team that somehow beatUshijima. Kageyama also recognizes Sakusa, and notes internally how he gets to watch one of the top three hitters in the whole country up close[32]. He then introduces himself to the other, and heads to the training camp. Once inside the gymnasium, Kageyama is immediately awestruck with the place. After listening to a speech fromFuki Hibarida, Kageyama notes that there's a player who is almost as short as Hinata attending the camp and wonders if he's a libero. A while later, Kageyama is seen playing a practice game with the other youth camp players. He manages to set a botched pass from one of his teammates,Motoya Komori, to Sakusa, another one of his teammates, who spikes the ball. It's received by another player, and flies above the net. Kageyama realizes that he can spike the ball back to the other side but is blocked by the short player he noticed earlier,Kōrai Hoshiumi. However, Komori succeeds in saving the ball, and Kageyama, in his excitement, sets a minus-tempo toss, expecting a player to be there to hit it. Of course, no one is, and Kageyama apologizes, calling it ""habit.""[33] Kageyama calls Sakusa ""normal."" Later on, Kageyama eats dinner withEikichi Chigaya. Dubbing him ""Broccoli No. 2,"" Kageyama mostly ignores Eikichi's attempts at conversation, eating his food silently and answering his questions with short responses. Sakusa then approaches the two, asking Kageyama why Shiratorizawa lost, and if it was because Ushijima was physically injured which caused him to not play at his best. Kageyama answers that Ushijima seemed in perfect shape to him. Sakusa reacts with disbelief and begins questioning if Karasuno used tricks or actually stuffed Shiratorizawa's ace. Kageyama confirms the latter, which provokes Sakusa to interrogate Kageyama on who managed to pull off the feat. Komori soon intervenes and tries to pass off Sakusa's behavior as being over cautious and needing to know as much about potential opponents as possible. Kageyama asks Sakusa if he had gotten serious at the camp yet, stating that he has seemed awfully normal so far. This annoys the spiker, and he leaves for a bath, with Komori soon departing as well. Eikichi comments on Kageyama's bold remark to one of the top three hitters in the nation, and Kageyama justifies himself by saying that he only meant Sakusa seemed normal ""so far."" The conversation drifts to the short player who had blocked Kageyama earlier, Hoshiumi, and Eikichi asks if Kageyama knew him. He denies this, and Eikichi then asks if Hoshiumi is as good at jumping as Hinata only for Kageyama to answer that Hoshiumi is even better. The next day, Kageyama plays another practice match. He tries and fails to reach a ball going over the net to set it. The coach of the youth team,Kotarō Hitaki, tells Kageyama to position himself further from the net. As the game continues, two spectators comment on Kageyama's ability to sync up with a left-handed middle blocker right away, as well as his keen instinct and impeccable technique. Kageyama is then seen asking Eikichi about his set, and how it could be better. Komori sees this and reflects on how it's scary that Kageyama could take a vague request and actually manage to do it. Kageyama then goes on to try to talk with his other teammates, and Eikichi notes that though the setter isn't good at the communication thing, he's really trying his best at it. The match goes on, and Kageyama closely observes Hoshiumi as he takes his jump and spikes the ball past the blockers. Hoshiumi confronts Kageyama. After practice, Kageyama is doing his stretches when Hoshiumi confronts him, asking where the setter had seen him previously. Kageyama denies ever seeing him before, and Hoshiumi snaps; questioning why Kageyama wasn't more surprised when he saw him playing. He then goes on to rant about how most people think he is not a formidable player because of his height, but when they see him play, they realize how scary he is. Kageyama confirms this, saying that he finds Hoshiumi scary, but that he's a useful reference, too.Atsumu Miyathen inserts himself into the conversation, informing Kageyama that for the prickly first impression he gave, he's a ""goody-two-shoes"" out on the court[34]. A day passes, and Kageyama is seen standing awkwardly with a scowl on his face. He thinks back to that one game in middle school, when his teammates purposely turned their backs on him, ignoring his set. The words fromOikawaand Atsumu then run through his mind; the former telling him to put the ball exactly as the spiker wants it, while the latter informs him that he's a ""goody-two-shoes."" Hitaki, the coach, asks another man if something was wrong with Kageyama, who responds that not with his condition, at least. The man brings up Kageyama's middle school career, and how he never stood out even though he was a ""prodigy."" In return, Hitaki muses about how prodigies are the furthest from being a perfect player, and that's what makes them so interesting. Atsumu is then seen looking at Kageyama, laughing a bit, and wondering if he had said anything wrong. Kageyama gives high fives to Atsumu and Hoshiumi. The last day of camp arrives, and Kageyama is playing another practice match wherein they have switched to playing different positions. Komori digs a dink, and Kageyama notices that the other boy immediately got out of the way of the back row attacker's approach. Hoshiumi sets the ball, and Kageyama scores. He is then seen giving high-fives to Hoshiumi and Atsumu. A man comments that Kageyama makes a good left-side wing spiker, and Hitaki, the coach, adds that he can play any position pretty well[35]. The match continues, and Kageyama feels himself rising to everybody else's level. Atsumu sets the ball to Kageyama, who scores again. On the sidelines, the coach chuckles to himself about how he hopes that the players don't go back to their own teams and wonder: ""What happened?"", after spiking Kageyama and Atsumu's sets. Practice ends, and Atsumu approaches Kageyama while he's stretching, asking him how he liked spiking. Kageyama states that it was fun, and compliments Atsumu on his setting skills. As the conversation continues, Atsumu asserts that Kageyama was more cut-out to be a wing spiker than a setter, because he actually looked like he had fun while playing as a hitter. Kageyama simply replies that he plays setter, though. He then asks Atsumu what he meant by ""goody-two-shoes,"" with the latter replying that Kageyama was ""serious and obligin' on the court — a real good boy."" The camp concludes with a speech from the coach, and the players depart back home. Atsumu says his goodbyes to Kageyama, and he returns the gesture. Hoshiumi, Sakusa, and Komori then pass him by, with the first two sending him glares and Komori waving goodbye. Kageyama gives a respectful bow to all of them. Eikichi pops up, also saying his goodbyes and wishing him good luck in the tournament. Kageyama expresses his gratitude, and subsequently asks where the station is, with Eikichi saying that he'll walk him there. The two are seen leaving together. Kageyama tells Hinata that he can jump higher. Kageyama arrives at Karasuno High School and sees Hinata for the first time in almost a week. Immediately, the two start racing to the clubroom, with Hinata squeezing out the win with a dive to the door. After catching their breaths, Kageyama asks what Hinata did the past week, with the latter saying that he learned how to play ball boy. Kageyama is surprised at first, but quickly responds with a grin to the smaller boy's statement. Afterward, the two start passing a volleyball around, since neither of them has the key to the clubroom or the gym. Hinata asks Kageyama about his camp, and he brings up Hoshiumi, informing Hinata about the other ""Little Giant"" and how amazing he was.[36]Tanaka eventually arrives with the key to the clubroom, and as they climb the stairs, Kageyama tells Hinata that he can jump way higher. The rest of the team arrives, and Daichi calls for serve drills. Kageyama starts practicing his jump serve, and he notices that the ball didn't hit his hand right. His serve heads out of bounds, however, Hinata manages to quickly move into its trajectory, surprising Kageyama and everybody else. Around the end of practice, Coach Ukai approaches Kageyama, and asks him about the camp and whether there was anything that concerned him. Kageyama brings up Atsumu's ""goody-two-shoes"" comment, and Ukai tells him that: ""There is no better set than the one that's easier for [the] hitter to hit""[37], and that he has nothing to worry about on that front. Practice ends, and Hinata approaches Kageyama, asking what the setter meant when he told him he could jump higher. Kageyama explains how Hinata was jumping like ""ba-boing ba-boing,"" but really awesome jumps went ""dun"" instead.[36]He elaborates that Hinata should think about where he rests his weight when he jumps, and that high, stable jumps are ones where you can hear the sound of your feet kicking off the floor. The third years are then seen heading into the clubroom, and Sugawara remarks how crazy Kageyama and Hinata are for volleyball, practicing so vigorously even after attending training camps. Asahi though, notes that ever coming back from camp, Kageyama seemed upset. Back at the gym, Kageyama and Hinata practice the new jump, with the latter complimenting Kageyama internally for his amazing and consistent sets. After a couple of failed attempts, Kageyama yells that Hinata should actually think about where he puts his weight when he jumps, focusing it on the ball of his foot. Hinata takes his next jump with Kageyama's advice in mind, and it seems that he'll actually get it this time, but Daichi interrupts the two, yelling at them to go home. The next day at practice, Hinata mentions that whenKanji Koganegawaset for Tsukishima back at the mock training camp, the latter hit the ball at a higher point[38]. Kageyama hears this and takes on a look of deep thought. Karasuno then heads over to Date Tech for their practice match, and Kageyama is seen glaring at Koganegawa, thinking about Hinata's earlier words. The game starts, and Kageyama sets to Asahi, who is completely blocked. Ukai notes that for Kageyama, this game might be a harder match than Shiratorizawa due to the pressure exerted by Date Tech's blockers. The game continues, and Date Tech manages to shut out a good portion of Karasuno's attacks. In fact, Kageyama notices that they managed to scare him out of going down the middle. However, this only makes Kageyama more excited, thrilled to play against such good opponents. Kageyama provokes Nishinoya. As the match proceeds, Nishinoya manages to dig a dink, though Kageyama immediately tells him that he's in the way in a disrespectful manner. This provokes the libero, and he confronts Kageyama after the rally ends. Kageyama explains that to him that he was in the way of the back row hitter's approach, and Nishinoya instantly understands and backs off. Tanaka then approaches Kageyama, telling him he could have put it in another way, to which the latter asks how. This pisses Tanaka off, but Daichi quickly intervenes. Off to the sidelines, Yachi notes that the situation seemed scarier than normal. As the game continues, Date Tech's blockers do very well, managing to get a hand on a bunch of Karasuno's attacks. This puts a lot of pressure on Kageyama, and Hinata notices his odd behavior, like how he's abnormally quiet. As Karasuno's hitters continually miss or have their spikes blocked, Kageyama is seen getting more and more frustrated, and when Asahi apologizes for hitting the ball out, Kageyama tells him to just score already. Tensions are high, and the team notes how on edge Kageyama is. After Karasuno loses the first set, Asahi approaches Kageyama, only for the latter to finally snap, yelling that he was putting up the ball the way his teammates wanted it, so they should just score already. Immediately, Kageyama realizes that he had just acted like his junior-high self, a look of shock appearing on his face. Tsukishima butts in, remarking that the king is back, and Kageyama starts to apologize, only to be interrupted by Hinata, who asks what's so bad about being a king. He then declares that it doesn't matter if Kageyama is tyrannical or egotistical, because he could just not listen to him if he doesn't agree. The other members agree, and Hinata adds that though it doesn't matter whether Kageyama is ""king"" or not, being a ""king"" is pretty cool. Coach Ukai then approaches the pair, stating that though the best set is one that is easiest for the spiker to hit, that doesn't mean that Kageyama can't argue for what he wants. Set 2 begins, andKinoshitamentions that Kageyama is surprisingly considerate of everybody. Yamaguchi brings up the falling-out he had with his teammates back in middle school as a possible explanation, and Sugawara comments that that was what woke up Kageyama to the possibility that he could be the one in the wrong. Close by, Coach Ukai and Takeda discuss the benefits of arguments, with Ukai noting that though Kageyama is finally figuring out how to tell others what he thinks, he wonders if his teammates will be able to nit-pick his playing since he's levels above everyone else. However, Ukai's doubts are quickly proven wrong when back on the court, Hinata calls out Kageyama for barely setting the ball to the middle blockers the entire game. On a run a few days prior to the national tournament coming, Kageyama gets a text fromHinatawhich asks him if he is willing to come to the year's pilgrimage along withYamaguchi. When Kageyama refuses, Hinata is seen throwing away his phone. Soon after, however, Kageyama encounters Hinata,Tanaka, andNishinoyain front of Karasuno's gym and reveals toDaichithat he simply felt like coming over. After this, Daichi urges the four to come home while pushing them away. The next day, Hinata becomes awed at being able to play on the stage theLittle Giantwas able to play in. At this, Kageyama corrects him by saying that the Little Giant played someplace else. Shortly after, Kageyama meetsKomori. After a short conversation, Kageyama asks the libero ofSakusa's whereabouts since he knows that the two attend the same school. InKarasuno's match againstTsubakihara, Kageyama shows signs of having trouble adjusting to the new surroundings. He sends his first serve out-of-bounds and later is not able to sync up withHinata. Kageyama requests a little time to get his senses in order and the team do their best to give Kageyama the time he needs. Through several plays, Kageyama gets closer and closer to getting back on track though it is still clear that he is sending imperfect sets to the spikers. When Tsubakihara reaches 15 points, Kageyama feels he has finally adjusted and notices Hinata's eagerness for a set. In the next rally, Kageyama is able to send Hinata a perfect set for a quick attack. Kageyama further frustrates the Tsubakihara team when he executes a setter dump and is heavily praised by most of his team thoughAsahiclaims their 'compliments' are actually insults. After Kageyama serves,Shimadabelieves that Kageyama would not be able to make the set but the first-year surprises everyone when he is quickly able to rush forward from just serving and sets to Hinata. WhenHimekawacauses problems in the second set with his ceiling serve, Kageyama makes the request of high receives no matter how short they may be.Nishinoyais able to carry out the request and Karasuno stops Himekawa. Karasuno eventually goes on to win the match. After the match is over, Kageyama stumbles uponHoshiumi, along with Hinata andYamaguchi. Soon later, Karasuno's first-years watchKamomedai's match againstChikuida. When Yamaguchi wonders if Hoshiumi ever featured in a big magazine, Kageyama declines and explains that the ace despises being interviewed. At the first quick attack Kageyama andHinataattempt, Kageyama is stunned to see Hinata use his new jump. He is left speechless when Hinata forgets to hit the spike which results in Inarizaki gaining the point. Kageyama angrily warns Hinata that if he were to repeat what he just did that he would not receive any more sets for the rest of the game. Despite this, Kageyama is shown with a smirk at seeing Hinata is making his new jump work. Kageyama would attempt to blockAranwhenAtsumuturned the first touch into a set but was unable to make it in time. WhenDaichiunintentionally sends a receive close to the net, Kageyama purposely spikes the ball into the blockers to giveKarasunoanother chance to attack. This proved to be to their advantage when Hinata does a wide broad attack that stuns everyone watching. Even though the attack was successful, Kageyama was able to tell thatŌmimiwas nearly caught in Hinata's feint. During Kageyama's next serve, he is not affected by theInarizakicheer section trying to overwhelm him with booing. Instead, the cheer section decided to use a rhythm that slowly increased in order to throw off his timing. Kageyama's serve, while off, manages to get over the net but was received byAkagi. Immediately, Kageyama would witness Atsumu make a perfect first step into his set. AfterSaekoand her taiko group arrived, Kageyama used Hinata's want to do a back attack to set to Daichi. Although his captain was able to score, Kageyama saw that Ōmimi was able to stop himself from being drawn into blocking Hinata. Later in the set, Kageyama would catch onto the Miya twins attempting to copy the super quick attack. He and the others are speechless when they see the twins manage the quick attack on their first attempt. Shortly after, Atsumu was able to predict what attack Kageyama would try since the receive made was thrown off. Atsumu correctly guessed that Hinata would be the one Kageyama would trust the set to, but Atsumu was able to block Hinata's spike. Atsumu is able to predict Kageyama's next move as well, but Hinata surprises him by doing a block-out against his hand. During one play, Kageyama purposely sets a ball toTsukishimaat a higher point. The attack was successful although neither player would admit it to one another[39]. When Hinata is later able to blockOsamu, Kageyama would claim that it was a fluke and points out Hinata is the most surprised that his block worked. When Hinata later makes an emergency set toAsahi, Kageyama credits most of it to luck. Shortly afterYamaguchiis removed from being a pinch server in the set, Daichi receivesKosaku's serve but it heads out-of-bounds on Inarizaki's side. Kageyama stuns everyone watching when he suddenly rushes under the net and manages to return the ball to Karasuno's side without causing a penalty or foul[40]. During the second set, a triple block is able to get the ball in the air after Aran tried to spike past Karasuno's blockers. Kageyama attempts to push the ball over when it got within reach, but it was saved by Akagi. Kageyama would try to help block Aran again, but the ace was able to get past them. At Aran's third attempt to spike, Kageyama is unable to block him. AfterRisekiis removed from the court, Kageyama is able to score a service ace right away. After a timeout, Kageyama is again able to score a service ace when Osamu is unable to receive the serve. His third serve is received but because of the tension Aran had built, the Inarizaki ace put too much power into his spike, and it landed out as a result. Kageyama's fourth serve is received, and he immediately goes to set when the ball had returned to Karasuno's side. However, the twins and Aran were quick to put an end to his serves with a counterattack. During a timeout when Asahi was trying to encourageNishinoya, Kageyama ruined the moment when he requests high sets instead of a-passes and is pointed out by Hinata for having bad timing[41]. During a brief flashback,Ukaihad decided to have Kageyama pared with Aran with the intention of having the Inarizaki ace faced with a high block to try to keep him from finding a rhythm. Kageyama is successful in shutting down Aran's spike. Near the middle of the set, Kageyama would catch that Atsumu would bait Hinata andTanakainto blocking him as he switched from an apparent setter dump to a set. He later is taken by surprise when Hinata would make a perfect receive on Aran's spike and mutters: ""Nice receive."" Although Karasuno would lose the point in this rally, Hinata would question if the team had seen his receive. Kageyama would lie and say that he missed it even though Hinata claims he heard the setter compliment the save. Midway into the third set, Kageyama and Tsukishima were unable to sync up which caused a lost point. While Tsukishima would try to take the blame, Kageyama instead says he was the one at fault and will adjust his sets to Tsukishima's needs. When Inarizaki reached match point, a flashback shows that Tanaka had made a request of Kageyama in the first set of wanting fewer sets. However, Kageyama refused to agree to the request by stating that Karasuno needed Tanaka and his attacks. Kageyama would then make a silent threat to Tanaka to prove why the setter has so much faith in him. Tanaka would be successful in landing a super straight shot and Kageyama would give a sign of respect[42]. With Inarizaki still at match point, Kageyama serves and gets a service ace when the power behind the serve causes the ball to land out when Osamu tried to receive it. Kageyama would then throw Inarizaki for a loop when his next serve is a soft serve. Inarizaki would receive the serve but Kageyama and Hinata would use their quick attack to score. At one point, Kageyama would have to make a one-handed set to Hinata, but the ball begins to fall short. He becomes fearful that the ball will land without anyone saving it only for Hinata to use his foot to kick the ball over and put Karasuno at match point. Kageyama would then tell Hinata that he had the right to complain about the set only for Hinata to instead request to have the next set. Hinata and Kageyama block Osamu. After several exhausting rallies, Kageyama does a setter dump that would put Karasuno at match point once more. Like the team, Kageyama would soon be caught up in a fast pace as they became more desperate to gain the point and finish the game. He was oblivious to Ukai trying to get them to calm down and is only able to slow his pace when Hinata was able to send his receive high into the air to give them room to breathe. He is able to save Tanaka's blocked spike but the ball heads toward the back of the court. Tsukishima and Daichi were able to get the ball back to Inarizaki where Kageyama and Hinata would spot the Miya twins prepare to attempt the quick attack. The two were able to block the spike and gain the final point that would win the match for Karasuno. Kageyama and Hinata would find themselves surrounded by their team as they celebrated their win. Afterwards, Hinata would claim that he was the one who was able to block the spike, but Kageyama instead would claim he blocked it, with the two beginning another argument. After the teams shake hands, Kageyama would witness Atsumu call out to Hinata with the promise of one day setting for him but also warned that he would defeat Karasuno at the next Interhigh. When the team is back at their hotel, Kageyama would listen to Hinata as he spoke about facingKenmain the next match and how the Nekoma setter may not be too interested in the outcome of the game. Kageyama is the first to serve during the match but seems annoyed whenKaiwas able to receive the serve without much trouble. He andHinatawould soon use the quick attack to score the first point of the match. Kageyama would again be annoyed as Kai picking up his next serve but would appear to be more cautious ofKenma. WhenKuroowas able to spike past Hinata, Kageyama was the only one who could make the receive which ledNishinoyato make a set. Throughout the first half of the first set, Kageyama remains calm and levelheaded which allows him and Hinata to perform the quick attack several times. WhenTanakais able to receiveYamamoto's serve, the ball appeared like it would head back toNekomaand Kuroo appeared ready to slam the ball down until Kageyama beat him to the ball and made a set to Hinata althoughYakuwould receive the attack. When later faced againstLevtrying to block him, Kageyama would attempt to get the better of the middle blocker by hitting the ball against his arm only for his spike to be received and Lev would successfully counter by using his incredible height to spike over the block. When Hinata mentions his belief that his attacks are getting received more than normal, Kageyama tells him that he's simply imagining things. Kageyama is later able to tell that Kenma trickedAsahiandTsukishimainto blocking him when he looked like he would do a setter dump but changed to a set at the last minute, similar to whatAtsumuhad done the previous day. Kageyama and the others are left speechless when Kenma was able to win the first set for Nekoma when he returned the ball directly in the path where Kageyama made his forward approach and the confusion it caused allowed the ball to land before anyone could attempt to save it[43]. WhenSugawarapoints out how Nekoma is using the same tactic on Hinata thatKarasunohad done withAran, Hinata is flattered at thinking he's being compared to one of the top five aces only for Kageyama to quickly shut down his train of thought. When Hinata is able to score using the wide broad jump in the first rally of the second set, Hinata would attempt to get a compliment from the setter only to be ignored.Ukaistates that Kageyama uses his actions to get the message across to Kenma that he will have to think of something else if he wants to contain the super quick attack. When he and Hinata decide to start using Hinata's new improved jumping, Kageyama, like many others, is stunned when Hinata is able to reach a higher spiking point but barely managed to tip the ball over to Nekoma's side. He is quick to criticize the middle blocker on this but soon gives him another chance to use this new attack again. This time, Kageyama compliments Hinata on having made an acceptable jump and in turn receives a compliment from Hinata about his high toss. Near the end of the set, Kageyama becomes on edge when he seesInuokabeing brought into the match. He is soon proven right to be concerned when Hinata's next attack was right away blocked by Inuoka. However, he would relax some when Hinata was able to make his next attack count. As the third set begins, Kageyama right away scores a service ace. His next serve is picked up by Kai and stopped. Later, as Tsukishima and Kuroo begin to face off more, Kageyama becomes aware of Lev's presence at the net and admits that he is nervous about the middle blocker lying in wait[44]. Although nervous, he still gives Tsukishima the set and the attack made it through. When Kageyama serves again, he continues to be countered by Kai. As the set inches closer to ending, he is able to land a setter dump and then perform the quick attack with Hinata that puts Karasuno at match point. After Karasuno won the match, Kageyama makes a request of Kenma for them to meet at the national stage again the following year, although Hinata would claim that Kageyama stole his line. Not far into the match,Bokutomanages an impressive chest receive. Despite the crowd being amazed, Kageyama instead finds this a fluke. Sometime later, Kageyama gets angry atHinata's observation. While many of his teammates were somewhat nervous or on edge about facingKamomedai, Kageyama appears to be excited[45]. After the meeting, he is spotted byHinata,Kiyoko, andYachias he writes in his volleyball journal. Just before the team is about to head to the court for their match, Kageyama hearsSaekocalling out to Hinata to inform him that the Little Giant has come to watch the match. He follows Hinata as he rushes to meetKarasuno's original Little Giant,Tenma Udai. Kageyama mostly stands close by as Hinata asks his idol about his current involvement with volleyball only to learn that Udai retired from volleyball after high school. At this point, Kageyama notices that it's time for the match to start. He and Hinata rejoin their team where Hinata states that he is surprisingly not upset after meeting Udai, to which Kageyama says: ""Finally."" For Karasuno's first attack of the game, Kageyama and Hinata perform the quick attack down the center. Although Hinata had been faced with a triple block, he was still able to make it through with no problem and even left some of the blockers stunned. Afterwards, Kageyama noticed thatHirugamipicked up that Karasuno would attempt a center attack and had decided to continue with the attack even knowing that there were blockers waiting. With Karasuno having scored, Kageyama was now up to serve. Four of Kamomedai's players are prepared to receive the attack with the hope of stopping him at just one.Nozawamanaged to receive the serve which led to Hoshiumi gaining the lost point for Kamomedai. After Tsukishima was able to perfectly lead a triple block to stop Hoshiumi's spike, Kageyama informs the Kamomedai ace that his time to surprise others has ended[46]. Near the midpoint of the set, Kageyama notices that Kamomedai's blockers were starting to do a dedicated shift onAsahiand therefore gaveTsukishimathe set since he looked to be clear to score unmarked. However, all three Kamomedai blockers would surprise the setter by appearing right before Tsukishima and blocked him. Kamomedai eventually was able to win the first set. At the start of the second set, Kageyama's powerful serve is received byHoshiumi. After several sets, Hinata is soon making a running approach into what looks to be his second wide broad attack. However, Kageyama instead performs a successful setter dump that puts Karasuno in the lead at 5-4. The two were later able to perform a perfect quick attack despite being off balance and further frustrated the opposing blockers. While Kamomedai is trying to figure out who will be to attack, Kageyama and Hinata perform a back attack. Their attack and Tsukishima's blocking cause the three first-years to be given heavy praise by the tournament announcers. This causedSugawarato try to convinceDaichiandAsahinot to let the first-years take all the spotlight. When the score reaches 14-14, Kageyama is up-to-serve. He surprises Kamomedai by performing a soft serve instead of his normal powerful serve. This earns him a no-touch service ace whenHakubaand Nozawa hesitate on who will make the receive. Hoshiumi is able to receive Kageyama's next serve but in doing so keeps him from making an attack. After a timeout, Kageyama is complimented by Sugawara for his play with Tsukishima. Kageyama admits that he was aware of Hirugami being able to stick with the quick attacks and was becoming frustrated about it. Because of this, Kageyama had decided to try to get at least one attack past him. AsTanakareceives Hoshiumi's second serve, Kageyama feels Hinata already preparing for a minus tempo attack. However, Hinata also uses his new jump combined with his speed. Despite this, Kageyama still delivers a perfect set and Hinata is able to get by Hirugami and Hakuba and leaves many people speechless in the process. Hinata is quick to grab Kageyama's hand and excitedly praise his sets to be at their peak. Kageyama pushes the middle blocker away but notices something afterwards. In the third set,Nishinoyawas able to receive Hoshiumi's serve but the ball appeared like it would go over the net. Before it is able to, Kageyama was able to reach the ball and set to Hinata, but the attack was right away blocked by Hirugami. Shortly after Hinata was able to keep the attention of the blockers long enough for Tanaka to get an attack in, Kageyama and others hear Hinata confess that he would now like to have the nickname The Strongest Decoy, having overcome how he had originally believed the title to not be very pleasing. Kageyama reminds him that being the decoy is the best position one can have after being a setter[47]. When Tsukishima rotates back onto the court, Kageyama is quick to use the same threat on the middle blocker that he had done on the setter of not running away, annoying Tsukishima in the process. After Hinata's serve is received and returned to Karasuno, Kageyama attempted a setter dump but was caught by the blockers. He would get a chance at revenge after Hinata was able to receive Hakuba's spike and the two performed the minus tempo back attack. Although the team celebrated the success of this attack, their joy quickly turned to worry when Hinata suddenly collapsed. Kageyama then reveals to the others that he suspects the middle blocker has a high fever, having noticed how hot Hinata's hands had felt when he had praised the setters set during the second set. When Hinata tries to deny this, Kageyama points out Hinata's behavior since the start of the tournament and how he has never seemed to get the proper rest, nor had he been eating properly. Hinata is soon revealed to have a temperature of 39.1°C and, after he made a desperate attempt to stay, the decision is made to remove him from the match entirely so he can be taken to get medical care. Once the game is about to continue, Kageyama repeats whatEnnoshitahad once told him of all Karasuno's spikers being strong. Not long after, Kageyama attempted to set to Tsukishima only for the middle blocker to get a sudden leg cramp. Tsukishima is taken out of the match andYamaguchiis sent into the game in his place. Kageyama surprises everyone when he gives Yamaguchi a set despite him just moving onto the court. Karasuno eventually lost the match and afterwards Kageyama confesses that he would have liked to help the current team go even further, surprising his team at his admission[48]. Sugawara is moved to tears that Kageyama was able to make this kind of emotional connection with the Karasuno team and is certain that he will be able to feel this way about other teams in the future."
How many service aces does Kageyama have in a row?,five,Final arc,"Immediately after graduating high school, Kageyama joined a professional team in Japan's Division 1 volleyball league instead of attending college and played in the 2016 summer Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro[49]. In November 2018, uponHinata's return to Japan and entering the V-League as a new member of theMSBY Black Jackalsteam, Kageyama reunites with his former partner. Kageyama currently plays as the starting setter for theSchweiden Adlersand is teammates withUshijimaandHoshiumi. As the match is about to start and Kageyama prepares to deliver the first serve of the game, the announcers note that he had recently played against France and scored five service aces in a row. However, his serve is received by Hinata. Hinata would then counter and score the first point of the match. WhenNicollas Romeroscores the first service ace for the Adlers, Kageyama is shown giving great support. When Romero's next serve is received and Hinata andAtsumuperform their own version of the super quick attack, Kageyama is able to receive the ball but, to his annoyance, it lands out of bounds. Despite this, Kageyama seems to start a new rivalry with Atsumu upon remembering how the former Inarizaki setter promised that he would one day set to Hinata and now, not only made good on his promise, has formed a new version of the super quick attack[50]. While the Adlers are in the lead at 3-2, Kageyama attempted to receiveSakusa's spike but was unable to due to the unique spin of Sakusa's spike thatAkaashistates is thanks to Sakusa's flexible wrists. When Hinata later does a jump serve that narrowly missed landing in, Kageyama mocks Hinata for his failed serve. When Hinata next attempted to try to keep Romero from attacking, Kageyama proceeded to set for the Brazilian ace and the attack was successful. Kageyama was immediately given praise by Romero that caused envy in Hinata, Bokuto, and Atsumu[51]. When Romero next tried to trick the Jackals by using a feint shot and Hinata was able to make the receive, Kageyama notices something about Hinata during the play. After several more rallies, Romero points out to his teammates that he recognized Hinata as the famed Ninja Shōyō. However, Kageyama, Ushijima, and Hoshiumi are unfamiliar with what Romero is speaking of. Kageyama, however, makes a connection from Hinata's new nickname and realizes that he is now acting as a decoy for himself. When Hinata appears to attempt a wide broad attack, the Adlers blockers are temporarily distracted by this long enough forMeianto get a spike through the block. Kageyama then hears Atsumu state how great the play felt and glares at him in annoyance. Early in the second set, Kageyama notices Hinata's improved balance when he is able to receive Ushijima's serve and blames the training Hinata must have done on the sand. Kageyama begins to shine more in the set when he is first able to score a service ace and then perform a one-handed set to Romero, although he does not understand Romero praising him in Portuguese. In another rally, Kageyama appears like he will make a set only to suddenly lower his hands and allow the ball to pass over to score[52]. It was at this time that Atsumu would tell Hinata that it was because of him and the other players of Karasuno that Kageyama became so skilled as he had learned to have a wide variety of sets to use for his hitters. Kageyama himself acknowledges that it was because of his former Karasuno teammates that he became as skilled as he is now. Shortly afterwards, the Adlers would win the set 25-21. Kageyama delivers the first serve of the third set. While Hinata was able to receive the serve,Fukurō Hirugamiwas able to block Meian's spike. Kageyama then scores a no-touch service ace. His serves are eventually stopped whenShion Inunakiwas able to receive and the Jackals would score. Later on, Ushijima attempted a block-out and Atsumu dove to save the ball. This left Hinata to once more be called on to make the set. Kageyama tries to figure out what Hinata will attempt only to be caught off guard when Hinata suddenly spikes the ball with his left hand and wins the set for the Jackals[53]. Just past the mid-point of the fourth set, Kageyama angers the Jackals when he performs a power tip after looking like he would do a regular setter dump[54]. He would soon repeat what he had done during the game against Inarizaki by running under the net to make a set back to Hoshiumi. He begins to put pressure on the Jackals by delivering several powerful serves. As each team begins to rack up points and the set starts getting closer to the end, Kageyama attempted to block Hinata when he and Atsumu tried to use their quick attack, but he was unable to stop Hinata's spike. Kageyama attempts another one-handed set to Romero who attempted a feint, but Hinata was able to receive the ball. As Hinata attempted to spike, Kageyama was able to block him. However, Hinata would kick the ball up with the back of his foot and then launch himself into what appeared to be a wide broad attack. Kageyama and Hirugami are distracted by his actions and are therefore late to try to block Bokuto from winning the game. While the teams shake hands, Kageyama congratulates Hinata for finally making it to his level. Hinata then gives a grand total of wins and losses of their personal competitions before the two-start debating if they should add their separate competitions from Brazil and other scrimmage matches into the amount. During their cool down stretches, Kageyama overhears Hinata speaking with Romero and his son,Rubens Romero, in Portuguese and questions how many languages Hinata can actually speak at this point. During an autograph session, Kageyama spotsKindaichiandKunimiin the crowd. He calls out to them and asks if they would be willing to play volleyball with him one day. The two agree to his request. Afterwards, Kageyama is seen reuniting with Hinata,Tsukishima,Yamaguchi, andYachi. In 2021, Kageyama once more plays on the National Team for the Tokyo Olympics and is seen eagerly awaiting the opportunity to once again play againstOikawa. In their first attack of the match, Kageyama and Hinata perform their famous super quick attack. In 2022, Kageyama is now part of the Italian Serie A profession team Ali Roma. He is once more faced against Hinata who is now part of the Brazil Super League team Asas São Paulo. As they face one another in the finals of the FIVB Club World Championship, Hinata and Kageyama each vow that they will be the winner. In Rome, Kageyama is visited byKuroo. Kageyama is playfully jostled around by his teammates but promises to join them after he finishes with Kuroo. Getting right to business, Kuroo details how Kageyama will get the chance to play alongsideAlexandre Joffeif he agrees to join the match. Aware of Joffe's reputation, Kageyama becomes interested and gives his instant agreement when Kuroo adds how high Joffe's spiking height is. In August, Kageyama travels to Japan and to the Ota-City Gym where he meets with some of his assigned teammates. He,Ushijima, andBokutodiscuss how to make a dish with white charcoal and missHoshiumi's annoyed expression at what they think white charcoal is. When the teams are ready, they take the court and are greeted by fans and friends. He andHinataare seen shaking hands just before the game starts."

What is Tsukishima's nickname?,Ushijima,Personality,"Tsukishima is very blunt and will sometimes rile his teammates up due to his antagonistic nature and sometimes other teams because of his casual smug attitude, taking pride in and relishing when his opponents see him as a nuisance as seen withTendōandShirabu. Whenever someone does or says something stupid or silly, he is usually seen snickering in the background. However, he does seem to be intimidated by his seniors, being nowhere in sight when Daichi reprimands Tanaka for antagonizing Aoba Johsai even though he did so as well or backing down wheneverEnnoshitacalls him out. Despite coming across as arrogant, Tsukishima has low self-esteem and thinks of himself as inferior. This is first noted to be a surprise by Kuroo, who accidentally riles him up by suggesting he'll lose to Hinata, to which he says that he's already below him. After the Shiratorizawa match, despite being the MVP, he's seen calling himself lame for only being able to blockUshijima's spikes once, only adding to how little he believes in himself and his achievements. While he willingly admits his own faults, he does not like it when others point these things out, becoming annoyed and angry when Hinata tried to take responsibility in blocking Ushijima and then when Bokuto called his blocks weak in a sense of strength given how easily he got by him during practice. Although Tsukishima maintains a persona of someone who shows little interest in anything and wouldn't do something he didn't like or enjoy, he does truly enjoy volleyball. He initially refrained from putting too much effort into volleyball and being too passionate about it out of fear of suffering from the same fate as his brother. However, after his confrontation withYamaguchiand hearingBokuto's inspirational words in the Tokyo training camp, he started to take the sport more seriously and finally found his passion and motivation for volleyball when he blocked Ushijima. Tsukishima keeps his cool, for the most part, but he can be seen getting visibly annoyed when people underestimate him or tell him what he can or cannot do and uses it as motivation to prove them wrong. He also says things like ""It's not a competition"" with Hinata but then immediately proceeds to do something to make him jealous, such as the time difference attack during the Shiratorizawa match. Since blocking Ushijima, Tsukishima has notably become more passionate in stopping powerful spikers by using different methods. According to Akiteru, ""Kei is blunt and doesn't show his emotions often, but he is actually a very hardworking and kind boy."""
What does Tsukishima do when he sees Yamaguchi being bullied by several other boys?,"He doesn't do anything, except call them pathetic; although it is unknown if this was aimed at Yamaguchi and/or the bullies",Background,"Tsukishima was shown to be a lot more cheerful when he was younger and have a very close relationship with his older brother,Akiteru. He would attend several of Akiteru's middle school matches and seemed to enjoy the attention he received from locals who knew him as the younger brother of the team ace. Sometime in elementary school, he seesYamaguchibeing bullied by several other boys. He doesn't do anything, except call them pathetic; although it is unknown if this was aimed at Yamaguchi and/or the bullies. Shortly after, Tsukishima runs into Yamaguchi again when he was observing a volleyball class. Although he didn't remember Yamaguchi right away, Tsukishima is soon flattered by him when Tsukishima claims that his older brother plays at Karasuno as the team ace, and the two quickly become close friends. Although Akiteru would state to be working very hard during practice and playing as the team ace again, Tsukishima was kept from attending any Karasuno games because his brother claimed he would become too nervous if he was being watched. When Tsukishima, Yamaguchi, and a classmate decided to attend one of Karasuno's games to settle a debate about Akiteru being a starting regular, Tsukishima discovers his brother is not on the team and is instead in the bleachers with the cheer section. Tsukishima's behavior toward his brother and volleyball changed from this point as he began to distance himself from Akiteru and also began to think that putting in so much hard work would only lead to disappointment in the future."
What is Tsukishima's nickname?,Tsukishima,Karasuno high team formation arc,"Tsukishima andYamaguchijoinKarasuno Boys' Volleyball Cluba few days after it begins for the new school year.[2]That evening, they go to whereHinataandKageyamaare practicing. To mess with Hinata, Tsukishima goes behind him and grabs the ball before Hinata can catch it and asks if the two are the first years who caused problems. When Hinata tries to reach for his ball, Tsukishima adds that elementary school kids should be going home, annoying Hinata. Kageyama cuts in and asks how tall Tsukishima is, though Yamaguchi answers for him. Tsukishima then points out Kageyama'sjunior highand wonders what an ""elite"" is doing at Karasuno. Hinata calls for Tsukishima's attention again and declares that they aren't going to lose the 3-on-3 and Tsukishima simply shrugs it off, surprising Hinata. Lightheartedly, Tsukishima explains that the match isn't important for him and Yamaguchi so they could just throw the game for them if they want. Kageyama gets angry at Tsukishima's taunts. Angered, Kageyama replies that no matter what Tsukishima does, he would still win. In return, Tsukishima laughs at his confidence and reminds him of his ""King"" nickname. As Kageyama tries to retort, Tsukishima continues bringing up his past and remarks that it's true Kageyama dislikes his nickname. Kageyama has had enough when Tsukishima brings up his performance during the prefecture semifinals last year and lunges forward, grabbing Tsukishima by the collar. After a few seconds, Kageyama lets go and simply walks away, causing Tsukishima to mock him even more. Suddenly, Hinata jumps up behind him and grabs the ball out of his hand, shocking him. As he lands, Hinata exclaims that he will defeat Tsukishima. Losing his composure for a second, Tsukishima glares at him, but quickly recovers and frivolously states that they should just have fun since volleyball is just a club anyway. He then walks away, leaving a confused Hinata staring after him. On the way home, Yamaguchi runs to Tsukishima and asks him what's wrong since he seems to be brooding. Coldly, Tsukishima replies that he hates uselessly hot-blooded people like Kageyama and Hinata. On the day of the 3-on-3, as the players are warming up, Tsukishima loudly provokes Kageyama and Hinata to make them lose their composure, promptingDaichito comment that Tsukishima has a bad personality. At first, Tsukishima easily blocks Hinata's spikes due to his height advantage and makes a point of emphasizing that and Kageyama's past. While Kageyama does his best to ignore him, Hinata gets angry and confronts Tsukishima, who reveals that Kageyama is only called a King because of his horrible attitude towards his former teammates. Tsukishima mocksHinata's lack of height. To his surprise, Kageyama responds that he is actually terrified of tossing the ball and not seeing anyone behind him like what had happened in junior high. Hinata quickly jumps in and adds that he doesn't care about Kageyama's past and will hit any ball Kageyama sends to him. Annoyed, Tsukishima replies that Hinata's genuine straightforwardness irritates him and reminds Hinata that he can't fill the gap in height with fighting spirit. Tsukishima starts playing seriously. Throughout the game, Tsukishima continues with his taunts, reminding Hinata that he can't just accomplish anything he wants just by putting all his effort into it. Hinata acknowledges that, but responds that he still wants to win with his body. As Tsukishima adds that his height is still an obstacle, Kageyama cuts in and states that as a setter, he will clear the path for Hinata.[3] When Hinata and Kageyama pull off their first planned quick, Tsukishima's shocked to discover that Hinata had his eyes closed and asks Daichi to explain it. After the two fail their next tries, Tsukishima wonders how long they're going to keep trying until they give up. Daichi adds that it's hard to see someone trusting someone else so completely, especially a rival. The next try, Tsukishima states to Kageyama that he should stop tossing to Hinata since it'll always fail. However, he's unnerved to see Hinata run up to Kageyama and quickly calls Yamaguchi over, leaving Daichi in the back. Hinata spikes successfully and scores. In the end, Tsukishima's team loses. After the match, Hinata goes to Tsukishima and holds out his hand, seemingly asking to make up because the upperclassmen will kick out any members who don't get along with others. Tsukishima ignores the hand and retorts that he only got kicked out because he ignored the upperclassmen and caused chaos. After Hinata leaves Tsukishima, Daichi approaches him and asks him what he thought of the match. Tsukishima replies that he didn't really care and knew he would lose since he was against Kageyama. Daichi grins and points out that Tsukishima still got pretty serious during the game. At that moment,Kiyokowalks in with the team jackets. At first, Tsukishima doesn't want to put it on, butTanakaandSugawaragoad him into wearing it. Lining up, the first years stand in front of the upperclassmen with their jackets on and officially get welcomed into Karasuno Boys' Volleyball Club. Upon their arrival atAoba Johsai High, Tsukishima, Yamaguchi, Tanaka, and Kageyama overhear two members of Aoba Johsai,YahabaandKindaichi, badmouthing Karasuno. Tanaka and Tsukishima join forces to intimidate the two Aoba Johsai players before Daichi arrives to reprimand them.[4] Later during the match, Tsukishima is seen mocking Kageyama and Hinata after Hinata struck Kageyama on the back of his head with a serve. It's apparent that Tsukishima is still unable to get along with his fellow first-years, especially Kageyama. The two nearly get into an argument in the midst of a game after they started exchanging insults. Amazingly, they end up in-sync and put up a strong block after growing competitive toward each other. After their successful block, Tsukishima and Kageyama end up arguing over whose hand stopped the spike until Daichi angrily shouts at them to stop[5]. Towards the end of the match, the coach of Aoba Johsai,Irihata, describes Tsukishima as a clever blocker, despite being somewhat lacking in drive. WhenOikawa, Aoba Johsai's captain and setter, arrives to pinch serve for their team, Tsukishima is targeted specifically for his weakness in receives[6]. He grows frustrated after continuously failing to receive Oikawa's serve. He becomes even more annoyed when Hinata stands up for him and gives him a speech about being allies. Afterwards, Tsukishima finally makes a save off of Oikawa's serve but ends up sending a free ball back to Aoba Johsai. However, his efforts ultimately give his team a fighting chance, and they are able to capitalize on it to win the match. Later when Karasuno is leaving, Oikawa stops them and point out Tsukishima and Hinata's need to work on their receives. He is shown to be uncooperative when Hinata proclaims that they will be doing special training[7]. When seeingHinataandKageyamaracing over who would get to the bath first, Tsukishima mocks them for their behavior. Tsukishima takes part in the practice match betweenKarasunoandNekomaas one of the starting players. Halfway into the first set, he is able to score when he uses a feint shot over Nekoma's block. This immediately catchesKenma's attention when he notices that Tsukishima is the opposite of Hinata in which he first thinks things through before taking action. Tsukishima's careful and attentive nature was soon proven when Kenma confirmed the middle blocker was studying him by using a decoy glance to trick him to go one direction only to set to the opposite side. As the match progresses, Hinata ends up getting blocked byInuokamultiple times. Seeing another instance of this, Tsukishima subtly eyesUkaito tell him that Hinata should get subbed out. However, the coach wants Hinata to learn to adapt on his own. DespiteTanakaandAsahibeing supportive of Hinata trying to discover new techniques in the middle of a game, Tsukishima tells him to stop slacking off and threatens to get him benched. Near the end of the second set, Tsukishima is able to block Inuoka cleanly, which leaves the spectators impressed. After the practice match, Tsukishima observes Hinata and Inuoka jumping about and babbling in gibberish. When he remarks on their choice of language,Kurooagrees that they are talking like children before suggesting that Tsukishima should let loose every so often instead of acting stoic all the time, to which Tsukishima replies that acting childish is not his style."
What is the name of Tsukishima's opponent?,Date Tech,Interhigh arc,"The match went by relatively quick withKarasunowinning the match. When Tsukishima is first rotated into the match, he makes the request of a set slightly further from the net fromKageyamawith the intention of trying to stay clear of the blockers. Though Kageyama is annoyed by Tsukishima calling him the King, Kageyama agrees to the request. The two nearly start bickering untilTanakaforces them apart when he noticedDaichiwas starting to get angry at their behavior. Tsukishima is able to score though Date Tech notices that the quick set he did was not the same as the oneHinatadid. In the second set,Ukaichanges the rotation to keep Hinata from being paired againstAoneso much. This results in Tsukishima now being faced against the Date Tech second-year more though he does not feel bothered by it when he tellsAsahithat Date Tech will most likely not expect him to be the one to make a flashy game changing point as that is Hinata's job while his role is to hold down the fort as best as he can. He adds that Date Tech will not be paying attention to him as the blockers have already focused their attention on the Karasuno ace. Midway into the second set, Asahi tells Tsukishima that his role as a blocker is vital to the team as it will help keep them from losing the lead and being able to defend so well against the famed Iron Wall is an incredible feat. He and Asahi would later prove that Karasuno has their own wall when they block Aone's spike. For majority of the first set, Tsukishima is not seen much. It isn't untilSugawarais sent into the match as the setter that Tsukishima starts to stand out. He and Sugawara switch blocking positions and Tsukishima successfully blocksIwaizumi. When Tsukishima goes back into the game shortly afterKageyamais subbed back in, it becomes noticeable that Tsukishima is now having trouble hitting Kageyama's spikes. During the time-out, Kageyama questions Tsukishima if he sets were good enough for the middle blocker. Tsukishima is not afraid to tell Kageyama that his tosses basically tell the spikers how to hit and that he'd like for the setter to be consistent since he has his own way of doing things. Tsukishima is surprised when Kageyama agrees to give Tsukishima the sets he wants. Back in the game, Kageyama immediately gives Tsukishima the uniform set he asked for and Tsukishima is able to get a feint shot over the block and score. Tsukishima does another feint shot over Seijoh's block butWatariis able to make the save, resulting in Tsukishima receiving overwhelming praise from Tanaka and Nishinoya. The same thing happens again when Tsukishima once more does a feint and Watari saves it. However, Tsukishima's next attack is a spike that Watari believed was going to be another feint and was therefore too far forward to properly receive. When Karasuno has reached set point, Tsukishima believes thatKindaichiwill receive the set but follows when Kageyama sees thatIwaizumiwill get the set. Together, the two first years are able to stop the third year and win the set for Karasuno. For the first half of the third set, Tsukishima mostly blocks, and communication attempts are made with Kageyama. He is able to once more use the feint shot to get past the blockers and score. After a chaotic rally, Tsukishima is surprised to seeYamaguchibe sent in as the pinch server. After Karasuno loses the match and goes to the dinner courtesy ofUkai, Tsukishima, though he does not cry like the others, is shown to be upset."
Who is Tsukishima's coach?,Nekoma,Tokyo expedition arc,"Shortly after Karasuno was defeated by Aoba Johsai,Takedaannounces that, thanks toNekoma's coach,Nekomata, Karasuno has been invited to join theFukurōdani AcademyGroup summer training camps which would give them the opportunity to practice against other teams. However, certain members of the team need to pass their final exams and avoid having to take supplementary classes if they want to join the training camps. Having learned that Tsukishima belongs to one of the college prep classes,HinataandKageyama, who are bad at studying, ask Tsukishima to tutor them so they can pass upcoming exams so they wouldn't miss the training camp. Tsukishima initially refused to help, but eventually agreed after Kageyama eventually broke down and begged him to help them. However, Tsukishima only agreed to teach Kageyama and Hinata before and after practices and refused to help any other time they asked. He also eventually stops teaching the two because he claims they were both too stupid to understand the lessons and when the two showed to have better progress from being tutored byYachi. In Tokyo, while the rest of his teammates are trying to individually improve, Tsukishima is shown to have no interest in improving his blocking. One night, through some coaxing byKuroo, Tsukishima joined the blocking/spiking practices between Kuroo and Fukurōdani'sKōtarō BokutoandKeiji Akaashi. He quickly leaves, however, when Kuroo teases him about Hinata possibly surpassing him because he doesn't put in any extra effort. Kuroo observes that Tsukishima, despite being taller and smarter than Hinata, actually feels inferior to the latter. Through a flashback, it is eventually revealed that the reason behind Tsukishima's dispassionate attitude towards club activities and inferiority complex towards Hinata is the experience of his older brother,Akiteru, as player for the Karasuno Volleyball Team. Akiteru is shown to have lied to Tsukishima about being the ace player of the volleyball team and tries to prevent Tsukishima from going to any games in hopes of him never finding out. Tsukishima eventually went to one of the games and discovered his brother's deceit which had a great impact on him. After a confrontation withYamaguchi, however, Tsukishima turns to Kuroo and Bokuto about what motivates them to continue playing and begins to find a new sense of motivation for himself. He begins improving his blocking abilities thanks to Kuroo's guidance and starts to demonstrate his new abilities during the final match of the camp. During the barbeque, Tsukishima is seen keeping apart from most of the group until Daichi, Kuroo, and Bokuto attempt to get him andKenmato eat more food despite their polite refusals. After returning home, Tsukishima met with his brother who was visiting home. After talking things through about Akiteru's involvement with volleyball when he was in high school and why he continued to play after graduating, the brothers seem to finally start repairing their relationship."
What is the name of Tsukishima's brother?,Akiteru,Spring high preliminary arc,"During the game, Tsukishima is able to correctly analyze the opponents plays and movements, thus being successful in blocking them many times. Before the game begins, Tsukishima overhears the other first years comparingHinata's height withHyakuzawa's and replacesYachi's 15-inches example of ""Hiya Kitty"" with a black-belly lantern shark, which makesYamaguchipraise him for his knowledge. During the game, Tsukishima is able to get pastMakado, or Kakugawa's defense as a whole, thanks to Hyakuzawa not being in the front row. As Tsukishima comes home, he is greeted by his brother,Akiteru, who asks him about his game that day. Despite informing his brother of Karasuno's victory, Tsukishima sounds indifferent as he says so. When Akiteru finds out that they took down a 6'7player, he speculates that his younger brother naturally thought that they were going to lose to such an advantageous person. After this, he offers to play with his team, the Kaji Wild Dogs. During practice the next day, Tsukishima rejectsHinata's idea of trying to come up with ways to blockUshijimaand angers the shorter middle blocker. Following this, he calls Akiteru to accept his offer. That evening, Tsukishima fails to block one ofAkaizawa's spike but doesn't blame himself as he doesn't expect a high school student like himself to be able to defeat an adult with a more powerful physique than he is used to. As Akaizawa taunts Tsukishima, he wishes to go home, but Akiteru claims that Tsukishima would block the next shot and silently urges his little brother to keep up with Akaizawa. When going back home, Tsukishima reflects back on his failed blocks, Hinata asking him about Ushijima, and Akiteru telling him that he'd expect to lose against those who seem advantageous. Sometime later, he is seen askingUkaihow he can block someone who is larger and stronger than him. When going to Tokyo, Tsukishima seems like he rejectedBokuto's offer to practice but uncharacteristically accepts, shocking many around him. After observingKuroo's block and how he used timing to his advantage, Tsukishima joins the practice. A few days later, Tsukishima jams his finger when going up against Akiteru's team. After the last practice of theirs, Bokuto wants to make sure that Tsukishima will defeatUshijimaand spurs nonsense about him defeating Ushijima if Tsukishima manages to do so, which confuses both Tsukishima and Akaashi. When Bokuto gloats that he'll become the greatest to ever live, Tsukishima internally remarks that it would be an easier feat said than done. Not long after, Tsukishima goes up against Akaizawa again and manages to block him for the first time thanks to having gotten used to his habits as well as having polished his skills. As Karasuno gets to the Sendai City Gymnasium, Tsukishima compares Hinata andKageyamato bugs afterYamaguchicomments on how they seem to have animal instincts. As the game against Johzenji is about to begin, Tsukishima tells Hinata to stop staring at his new sports glasses. During the match,Futamatatricks Tsukishima with a setter dump but he still manages to blockHigashiyamalater on. When Hinata is subbed out, Tsukishima tells him to stop fidgeting so much. When the first set concludes,Sugawaraattempts to explain the word ""austerity"" to Hinata and the latter gets offended when Tsukishima tells his senior that Hinata would just forget afterward. Sometime later, Tsukishima blocksBobatadespite Ukai having said specifically not to do so. When the rookie glances at his coach, Ukai does not complain. When seeingNakashima's family coming to support him after winning against Johzenji, Tsukishima looks slightly disturbed. Shortly before the game begins, Tsukishima noticesHinatalooking as if he was jealous ofNakashima's family cheering for him, which Tsukishima mocks him for. As Nakashima abuses and tools blockers throughout the first set, Tsukishima pulls a face of disgust, whichEnnoshitanotices. Sometime later, Tsukishima's blocking ofKawatabiallows Karasuno to go the first two-point lead of the game. WhenEnnoshitais subbed in, Tsukishima is not surprised that he is the one tasked to replaceDaichi. Although he gets surprised when seeingYamaguchiget subbed in as pinch server, Tsukishima quickly tells Yamaguchi to stop being nervous and assures him that he wouldn't have to pay such a price if he failed his serve. Despite Yamaguchi succeeding only one of his serves and not even attempting to jump on the second one, Tsukishima does not blame him. During the third set, despite Hinata catching Tsukishima off guard with his rebound, the taller blocker considers it a fluke. Sometime later, Tsukishima blocks Nakashima, which makes Wakutani Minami become uneasy and is able to tie the score of the 3rd set 13-13. Sometime later, Tsukishima sends Ukai's message to start more frequent tosses toAsahito Kageyama. Tsukishima is of great help to the team in the second set of the match. WhenYamaguchiwas able to redeem himself with a service ace, Tsukishima is revealed not to be surprised by his friend's successful float serve. He nearly gets scolded by Tanaka for appearing to not be supportive until Tsukishima confesses that he saw how much work Yamaguchi had put into his serve and this was the reason he is not surprised at how well it worked. Shortly afterwards, Tsukishima does a soft ricochet againstOikawato score which causes the third year to look at him in annoyance. When Seijoh reached set point, Tsukishima is momentarily distracted by Kyōtani acting as a decoy and thus was not able to blockIwaizumi. At the start of the third set, Tsukishima noticed howKyōtaniwas easily irritated byTanakaprovoking him. Tsukishima was able to use this to his advantage when he is in the vanguard as he is able to block Kyōtani after switching blocking positions with Tanaka. When Kyōtani was up to serve, Tsukishima saw that the ball would land out and was right in his assumption. Near the end of the third set, Tsukishima's teammates would become thrilled at seeingHinatablock Kyōtani's spike but Tsukishima remained unfazed and simply stated that this is the job of a middle blocker. Although not overly excited like his teammates, Tsukishima still celebrated in the team's win over Aoba Johsai. Despite his team's enthusiasm, Tsukishima is blunt to tell the team that he couldn't care less whether Karasuno wins nationals or not whenDaichireminds the team of their final goal. The next day,SaekospotsAkiterubefore the match begins. Tsukishima had told his older brother not to come to watch the game, but Akiteru still shows up 'in disguise', however a menacing aura still hangs around him when Akiteru says so. When seeingHinatabow the opposite way out of stress, Tsukishima taunts him by saying that he'd display his idiocy in front of everyone. During the match, Tsukishima's blocking fails him numerous times. However, he manages to deflectUshijimaonce, though he still gets frustrated. When reflecting upon the previous rallies, Tsukishima is shocked at himself when he remembers blinking when facing Ushijima, but he tells himself that he still knew he'd lose because it was the only conclusion, trying to tell himself that he wasn't like his teammates. Tsukishima is glad that his position doesn't require serve receiving and already loses hope in winning the first set. When Tsukishima is subbed in during the start of the second set,Tendōpoints at him calling him 'normal' in comparison to his other teammates. Shortly after, Tsukishima blocks Tendō and mockingly tells him that although his delayed spikes might work against ""a certain unnamed wild child"", it will not work on him and is glad when Tendō is frustrated over Tsukishima. Tsukishima would once more be given attention when Ushijima easily conquers his block. Right after, Tsukishima takes a short glance atShirabu, which alarms him but quickly looks away. Despite his shortcomings, Tsukishima would continuously stuff or deflect Shiratorizawa. Near the end of the set and Karasuno's second time-out, Tsukishima requests to leave the timing for blocking to him when it comes to putting triple blocks together. This turns out to be useful when Tsukishima manages to leave Ushijima only one spot to spike at, whereNishinoyais. The latter is able to perfectly dig the ball, which impressesYamagata. Kageyama then sets to Tsukishima, having pretended to set toAsahi, which frustrates Tendō even more. Shirabu then scores Shiratorizawa's 24th point in the set thanks to doing an unexpected setter dump. Despite Tsukishima managing to get his hand on it, he is still unable to block it. When Kageyama has his own turn to pull a setter dump, Tsukishima admits that it was a good move on his part. After Hinata is unexpectedly used as a decoy even after moved around wildly, Tsukishima remarks that it is in fact extremely distracting to have Hinata move around so much. Tsukishima blocks Ushijima. As the second set is wrapping up, Tsukishima remarks that Tendō's guess blocks are either 120% correct or complete wrong, but also that his read blocks have a 75% chance of succeeding. As he sees Shirabu about to set, Tsukishima thinks to himself that good blocking should never make the opposing setter think he's fooled that blocker. Following this, Tsukishima is able to get his hand on Ushijima's spike. When Asahi praises him for his deflection, Tsukishima still isn't satisfied with it. Nevertheless, he still continues with Karasuno's strategy to make Ushijima hit in Nishinoya's direction. In the very same rally, he sees Shirabu stressing out, and this satisfies Tsukishima as he was looking for a crack in Shiratorizawa's composure and this allows Tsukishima to block Ushijima. With sheer satisfaction, Tsukishima wins the second set and remembers whatBokutohad told him about the moment where volleyball would hook him. After this, he tells his teammates how he managed to block Ushijima, and his teammates are amazed at how far ahead he thought. Hinata praises Tsukishima for his block and smugly, Tsukishima gives him a look to indicate that he should try blocking Ushijima as well since he is also a middle blocker. Near the end of the third set,Asahiand Tsukishima lead Ushijima to spike in Nishinoya's direction and make sure to make his space cramped. After this, Asahi remarks that on top of Tsukishima developing as an individual blocker, he is also becoming the team's blocking leader. Shortly after, Tsukishima and Tendō's rivaling interactions are shown once more. When Hinata is subbed in for Tsukishima, he indirectly tells him to do his job in the front row. Following this, Tsukishima is up to serve. He tries to follow Ukai's advice of aiming his serve atReon, but it ends up inGoshikibotching his pass. Tsukishima is then rotated back in. in an attempt to motivate him, Yamaguchi yells at him not to let Hinata outmaneuver him. However, this only results in Tsukishima getting annoyed. Following this, Tsukishima reveals that he had been practicing withAkaashi, and this makes Kageyama jealous. Shortly after,Kawanishiattempts to block Tsukishima but he delays his spike and scores freely. Following this, Kawanishi notices that Tsukishima and Kageyama are out-of-sync when Tsukishima is being set to. However, when Kawanishi blocks him, Tsukishima saves the ball with his arm. Near the end of the fourth set, Tsukishima gets into a conflict with Tendō once more as Shiratorizawa scores against Karasuno. However, the next time Tsukishima blocks Shiratorizawa, he would get into a conflict within his own team, with Kageyama. When Ushijima spikes, Tsukishima deflects it. After this rally, Shirabu is about to insult him to Tendō, but Tsukishima hears this and thanks the setter for thinking of him as a nuisance. Shortly after, Tsukishima deflects numerous amounts of spikes from Shiratorizawa and earns the praise of many spectators. However, when he jumps to block Ushijima, the ball scrapes his finger. But because of Ushijima's force, it leads to a cut on his finger and he has to be subbed out. He doesn't express it, but while he sees his hand bleeding, Tsukishima is angry at himself for letting himself getting injured in such a desperate situation. However, Tsukishima comes back when Karasuno is in a dire situation as Shiratorizawa is one point away from winning. As Ukai is about to check on his health, Tsukishima tells him that's fine before he can ask questions. During the game, Tsukishima is desperate to win the game. However, upon taking a moment to pause, he finds himself foolish for being so much like Hinata. Despite this thought, he still manages to deflect Ushijima. In the following rally, Tsukishima tries to do a slide. Nevertheless, Tendō sees through it and knows that it's a bluff but still fails to block Tanaka. Shortly after, the rotation depends on Tsukishima to score, and he manages to block Kawanishi with read blocking. He follows this action by jumping in Karasuno's synchro attack. Shortly after, Tsukishima leads his teammates into another triple block. Despite this not being the first triple block of the match,Washijōremarks that this block was the first one that prevented Ushijima from performing a line shot. After Karasuno wins, Ukai goes to Tsukishima and is proud of his player for being such a help throughout the duration of the match. Despite this, Tsukishima is still upset at himself for only being able to block Ushijima once."
Who does Tsukishima try to pretend does not know Hinata?,Tsukishima,Tokyo nationals arc,"During team measurements, Tsukishima reveals, to the envy of many, that he has passed the 190 cm mark in height. When the team is measuring spiking height, Tsukishima is one of those shown to be studyingHinataclosely when he is ready to measure his height but learns that he beat Hinata by one centimeter; putting Tsukishima at having the second highest spiking point. AfterTakedaannounces thatKageyamawas invited to the All-Japan Youth Camp, Tsukishima learns that he was also invited to a training camp for first-years held atShiratorizawa Academy. Though he initially tries to reject the offer,Daichivolunteers Tsukishima to go to the camp anyway. After one day of practice, Tsukishima is listening asYamaguchimentions how he would like to attend the All-Japan Youth Camp and Tsukishima jokingly suggests he crash the camp; both unaware that Hinata heard their conversation. When Tsukishima arrives for the First-Year Training Camp, he and everyone else is surprised to see Hinata among them. Tsukishima tries to pretend that he does not know Hinata, but his cover is blown whenKoganegawarecognizes Hinata as someone who plays on theKarasunoteam. In a rarely seen moment, Tsukishima loses his usually cool demeanor to angrily yell at Hinata for attending the camp uninvited. His loss of composure surprisesKindaichiandKunimi[8]. After Hinata is allowed to stay on the condition of being a ball boy throughout the camp, Tsukishima joins in practices and gives simple responses to Koganegawa's request of how to make his sets better. When the first day of training ends, Hinata attempts to apologize to Tsukishima for the trouble he caused but Tsukishima quickly stops him before he can by stating that this behavior is something he expected of Hinata before mocking his teammate of possibly being upset at being a ball boy and not being allowed to take part in any of the official practices. During the practices, Tsukishima takes notice of Hinata's steady growth and would eventually ask Hinata to join him during a free practice to practice blocks. Despite his best attempt to block Hinata, Tsukishima was unable to block his spike and the act earned Hinata the favor and caution of many of the other first years. Koganegawa and Kindaichi join in the block when Hinata wanted to try another butGoshikitook the next turn instead and was able to trick the blockers by doing a straight shot when he made it appear he would try a cross shot. Though he was annoyed at being the shortest block, Tsukishima instantly pins the open side that allowed Goshiki to get through on Koganegawa but silently admits that he too thought Goshiki would attempt a cross court shot based on his form. Tsukishima would also admit he was impressed with Koganegawa and believes the training fromDate Techis the reason the setter does not jump at random. When Hinata asks if Tsukishima requested him to join in the practice for possibly giving Hinata the chance to practice with them, Tsukishima instantly denies this but does not reveal to anyone that he is aware of Hinata being a spiker capable of seeing the block and plans to practice against that as much as possible in order to be ready against the more powerful teams they will face at the Spring Tournament[9]. On the final day of the training camp, Tsukishima is paired with Goshiki for a 2-on-2 match against Kunimi andHyakuzawa. When Tsukishima delivered a poor set that Goshiki narrowly got over the net, Goshiki does not hesitate to scold him for it. Tsukishima is then able to get a soft block on Hyakuzawa's spike and then deliver a better set to Goshiki which would allow the wing spiker to score. Once the camp ends, Tsukishima expresses his weariness of having to return to normal practices after having completed the training camp. Sometime before the Date Tech practice match,Kageyamasets for Tsukishima. Seeing this,Hinatatells him about how he noticed Tsukishima had a higher hitting point when being paired withKoganegawa, to which Tsukishima does not pay much attention to. As Date Tech shuts down Karasuno immediately in the first rally, Tsukishima notices that Kageyama had intended to set above the blockers. Sometime later, Tsukishima blocksFukiage. In frustration,Futakuchithen successfully attempts to provoke Tsukishima. In another rally, Tsukishima manages to score with Kageyama's set. Despite this positive result, he remarks that Kageyama had an angry look on his face, which begins to get the two into an argument, though they are soon interrupted. Kageyama and Tsukishima would get into hot waters once more when Kageyama yells at him that he could have jumped again after falling for Date Tech's decoy trick. However, as he is, Tsukishima retaliates and goes back to calling Kageyama ""king"". These comments are slightly ignored but when Kageyama gets snappy with another team member, Tsukishima expresses what everyone is fearing; that Kageyama is reverting back to his old kingly self. Into the second set, Tsukishima fails to hit Kageyama's set and they get into a small quarrel. In the next rally, Tsukishima scoring past Date Tech's defense makesUkainotice that Kageyama is making his hitters get at a higher contact point rather than following their every command. When being subbed out, Hinata explains that Tsukishima had been hitting at higher points when practicing with Koganegawa, but now that Kageyama urges his players to hit higher, he can hit as high once more. After Karasuno wins the second set, Tsukishima expresses how intimidating he finds Date Tech's blockers. Despite his praising, he then shows mischievous excitement over Date Tech's ideal scenario of the final rally. Sometime later, however, Tsukishima adds what would be Karasuno's ideal scenario, which is to exhaust Date Tech's blockers and make them impatient to block whatever is coming their way. In the next rally, Kageyama starts to get frustrated over Tsukishima failing to score despite his perfect set and remarks that Tsukishima must be exhausted. After the match ends, Tsukishima hears Kageyama mispronounce Koganegawa's name and corrects him, which the setter gets mad about. That night, Tsukishima disregardsYamaguchi's determination not to lose his spot as pinch server as he believes in his abilities. On New Year's Day shortly before the national tournament begins, Kei refusesAkiteru's request to come celebrate with him. A few days later, Tsukishima is seen sleeping on the bus to Tokyo. That night,Ennoshitaforces Tsukishima to supervise Hinata and Kageyama while on their run and gives him a bike so that he can keep up. Before they start their run, Tsukishima strictly tells the two not to take any wild turns. Just before the team made it to theTokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium,TanakaandHinatahad run off to the bathroom. Tsukishima took the chance to tease Hinata that he would be left behind if he didn't return on time. During the match against Tsubakihara, Tsukishima is one of the greater concerns toSakae Echigodue to his reputation as the person who was able to blockUshijima. Tsukishima lives up to this reputation when he is able to quickly get several one-touches on many of the opposing spiker's attacks. However,Teradomariis able to get past Tsukishima and the other blockers when he proves not to be underestimated and hits a straight shot past them. While Tsukishima is shocked that Teradomari was able to get past the block, he is even more surprised to see Hinata in the right place to receive the spike despite receiving with his body. Tsukishima is later called on to make an emergency set whenKageyamawas forced to make the first touch. He recalls howGoshikiridiculed his poor sets during the First-Year Training Camp and givesAsahia set thatSugawaradescribes as being full of care. Although Asahi compliments Tsukishima on the set, the middle blocker silently claims that half of it was due to luck before noticing that Kageyama is glaring at him that Tsukishima states resembles that of Hinata's. Late in the second set, Tsukishima and Kageyama were not able to match their timing for an attack which causedDaichito make the save. Tsukishima right away believed that Kageyama would put the blame on him from possible weariness while Tsukishima put the blame on Kageyama having set higher than he had been thus far. When Karasuno reached match point, Tsukishima was subbed out so that Sugawara could go in. Thanks to the third year's determination, Karasuno went on to win the match. For majority of the first set, Tsukishima is seen attempting to block Inarizaki's attackers. He would be surprised at seeing the Miya twins successfully copyHinataandKageyama's super quick attack. WhenDaichi's receive goes back to Inarizaki, Tsukishima is able to perfectly read the play and blockOsamu's spike. After a timeout, Tsukishima is able to get a one-touch onGinjima's spike, his playing state being noted byKindaichito be in peak condition. Just beforeAsahi's second serve, Inarizaki calls for a timeout, whereTanakawould compliment Tsukishima for blocking the twins quick. Despite the compliment, Tsukishima would admit that the quick is troublesome. In the next rally, Tsukishima is able to make an approach that allows him to spike at a higher contact point when Kageyama intentionally sets the ball to a higher spot. Even though he was able to score, Tsukishima does not admit to Kageyama that he is relieved the attack worked. After Hinata was unable to beat Osamu in a joust, a time-out is called, whereUkaidecides to have the team start using the blending method. When Hinata acts like he remembers the plan, Tsukishima instantly calls him out on not knowing what Ukai is talking about, and he believes the lack of memory was a result from Hinata having seen the twins' quick attack and thinking his own was faster. When Karasuno is at match point, Tsukishima begins to notice how quickSunais to get the block up. Despite getting extra assistance from Tanaka, Tsukishima is surprised to see Suna get his spike past them. When Kageyama makes the save of Ginjima's serve that clips the net, Tsukishima goes to make the set. Although Tanaka calls for the set, Tsukishima instead sends it to Asahi and is unaware of the blow this does to Tanaka's confidence. However, once the rally had ended, he overhears Hinata excitedly praise Tanaka for trying to help block Tsukishima by explaining that middle blockers tend to block by themselves most of the time and it is comforting to have that extra help. Tanaka is able to win the set for Karasuno when he finally is able to make the cross-shot work and would questions Tsukishima if he had intentionally ignored his request for the set. Tsukishima explains that he had sent the set to Asahi as he had the better chance of scoring. Tsukishima would then admit that he finds Tanaka's mental strength terrifying and questions if he ever gets brought down. When Tanaka admits that he had been depressed during the last few rallies, Tsukishima is unable to believe him. In the second set, Asahi is able to getAtsumuto make the receive on his spike. Even though Osamu is able to cover for his brother and set to Suna, Tsukishima saw this possibility and tried to block him, but Suna again managed to get past him. Tsukishima would then become annoyed when Suna complimented him for being a talented blocker[10]. He gets another chance to stop Suna in another play and is joined by Kageyama, but they are unable to stop him. Sometime afterAranwas brought back into the game, a flashback shows that Ukai decided to have Tsukishima try to block Osamu in hopes of stopping the twins' freak quick attack. Tsukishima immediately teased Hinata for being now being the one to have the important job to do and successfully annoys Hinata at this. In the rally after Kageyama is able to block Aran,Kuroois able to figure out that Tsukishima has been using his blocks to help the back row receivers know what spike Suna would be attempting so they could try to position themselves to be in the right place to receive. Tsukishima had devised this plan during the team meeting and, although it took a while, proves to be effective as Daichi is able to receive Suna's spike. Suna himself is able to figure out that Tsukishima has deliberately been using his blocks to direct where he should spike and is able to get Tsukishima to admit as much when he thanks the first year for allowing him to spike the way he wants. Tsukishima, in turn, replies that he's thankful Suna has been spiking the exact way he expected[11]. Tsukishima is later tricked by Atsumu to go to the left side of the court when it appeared Osamu would spike only for Osamu to instead set to Aran on the opposite end. Because of this, Tsukishima was not able to help Daichi try to block Aran, but he would soon be rendered speechless at witnessing Hinata make a perfect receive on Aran's spike[12]. A little past the halfway point of the third set, Tsukishima's low stamina is noticed by Suna. This becomes apparent when he and Kageyama have off timing for an attack, which resulted in the point going to Inarizaki. Tsukishima would try to claim that he was the one at fault as he realizes just how much effort Hinata puts into his attacks with the intention of always being ready to attack. Kageyama would silence his fellow first year by taking the blame and promising that he will adjust his sets to fit Tsukishima's needs. When Tsukishima is faced with trying to block Suna again, he is aware that he cannot fully stop him and counts on Hinata to be in place to receive the spike. At this point, Tsukishima would notice that, despite having a clear mind, his body was starting to slow down. While he is able to get a one-touch on Ginjima's spike, he nearly collapses into Daichi but manages to stay on his feet. Tsukishima later attempts to save a receive that Kageyama tried to make but the ball instead went towards the back of the court. He is barely able to get the ball up long enough for Daichi to make the last receive and get the ball back over to Inarizaki. Hinata and Kageyama were able to block Atsumu and Osamu when they would attempt the quick attack, which led to Karasuno's victory. Weary, Tsukishima collapsed onto the court as his teammates rushed onto the court to celebrate. While Tsukishima is aware that everyone watching must be surprised by the outcome, he believes that no one on Karasuno is surprised, believing that Hinata and Kageyama were the only ones who did not falter in the timing of the twins' quick attack and were the ones to stop it. He admits that their speed is incredible and a fierce weapon, but was not invincible, and that Hinata and Kageyama knew this fact better than anyone else. In the sub-arena, Yamaguchi points out how tired Tsukishima is when it's pointed out that he was attempting to put a second jacket on over the one he was already wearing. At noticing Hinata was still fully awake and admiring the bruises on his arms from receiving Aran's spike, Tsukishima believes he bore witness to someone having their own special moment and that Hinata has become even more obsessed with volleyball. After this, Karasuno reunites at their inn to watch their match being mentioned on television. At the mention of Suna having being unstoppable, Tsukishima starts to twitch. Despite his silence, Yamaguchi angrily yells at the television that Tsukishima had done so purposefully but is soon stopped. As Tsukishima rotates into the match for the first time, his presence makesSuguru Daishōfeel unsettled although he is unsure why[13]. Tsukishima would notice thatKenmaseemed to avoid making eye contact with him and took it as an off-handed compliment that Kenma may not like him much. While Tsukishima would be able to get a one-touch onKai's spike, he would catch on thatKuroocould see thatKageyamawould set toDaichi. Kuroo would state to Tsukishima that he could tell where the ball would go because he noticed the way Tsukishima had his hands positioned during the block. When Tsukishima claims that Kuroo was secure enough to continue to give him blocking tips during the game, Kuroo would admit that he was just trying to annoy the younger blocker[14]. It would also be at this point that Suguru would claim that Tsukishima is exactly like Kuroo and thus the reason that he did not like the Karasuno middle blocker. AsYamaguchiis being subbed into the match, Tsukishima gets encouragement fromSugawaranot to lose to Kuroo. Tsukishima would admit that he is fully aware that he could not possibly beat Kuroo as the third year was far stronger than he is but does believe that he would stand a better chance with the right help. With Yamaguchi using his float serve to throw Nekoma off, Tsukishima was able to blockFukunagain a classic serve and block technique. He then high fives Yamaguchi as the team celebrated. Kuroo would then question Tsukishima how he felt about volleyball to which Tsukishima would answer that, thanks to Kuroo, it was now starting to become fun[15]. When Tsukishima rotates out, he hearsKinoshitapoint out that it appears the ball is getting byLevmore than usual. Tsukishima would agree with him but notices that Lev appears calmer than he normally is during a match and believes that Lev may have learned how to use his blocks to direct where a spiker should hit. Later, Tsukishima andAsahiwould attempt to block Kenma when it appeared he would try a setter dump only for the Nekoma setter to trick them by changing to a set and thus resulted in Karasuno getting called out for doing an over-net[16]. In the second set, Tsukishima mostly appears to try to block and attack earlier on but later begins to have a showdown against Kuroo and at times continues to feel overwhelmed by Kuroo and his greater abilities[17]. When Karasuno was edging closer to reaching set point, Tsukishima and the other players notice how Hinata was able to use his new jump successfully which would allow him to stay in the air long enough that the blockers would be the first to descend and he would have a chance to attack. Tsukishima in particular notices that Hinata now has more stability while in the air thanks to this new jumping ability. Tsukishima's rivalry with Kuroo continues into the third set while Tsukishima remembers times from the summer training camp when Kuroo laid out 'helpful' facts about foods and secrets aboutBokutoto Tsukishima and even getting the first-year to laugh when Kuroo and Bokuto switched hairstyles at one point[18]. Tsukishima attempts to beat Kuroo in a joust but is unsuccessful. Kuroo then pleads for Tsukishima to stop trying so hard as it would not only stretch the match out but also take a toll on his already low stamina. Tsukishima replies that Kuroo should also stop putting so much effort into the match and that it would have already ended by now if he did.Yakuand Tsukishima then state that part of Tsukishima's development was because of Kuroo mentoring him, with Kuroo replying that Tsukishima put as much work into his growth. A short while later, Tsukishima doesn't have a comeback when Kuroo points out how his blocks cause his opponents frustration and Daichi offers to punch the Nekoma captain if Tsukishima wants. Tsukishima continues to join in attacks and defense as the set continued. Karasuno goes on to win the match and Tsukishima is seen being approached by and shaking hands with Kuroo. Not long before Karasuno's match againstKamomedaibegins,Yamaguchiand Tsukishima are sitting together. Yamaguchi is shocked over how Karasuno made it so far but then tries to motivate Tsukishima but trips over his tongue while talking too fast. Immediately after, the two friends break into laughter after thinking back about Yamaguchi's wording. Soon after, once Karasuno is in the gymnasium, Tsukishima noticesAkiterutalking to someone and he asksHinatawho it is. Upon learning that it's the little giant, Tsukishima shows a small twitch of irritation. When Hinata notices Kamomedai's two meter goliath, he exclaims that he's the person who bumped into him and didn't even notice and Tsukishima teases him that he was probably too short to even have been seen. Hinata gets mad and warns him to better watch out for the back of his head once he serves. AfterHirugamidemonstrates his great blocking skills, Yamaguchi doesn't want to dismiss Tsukishima's blocking and tells him that he isn't counted out. Despite this, Tsukishima says that any team is at least going to have at least one standout blocker. However, he also says that no matter how good that person may be as a blocker, they are still only one single individual[19]. A short while after, Hinata is able to surpass an impressive triple block from Kamomedai and Tsukishima compares this with having to face multipleAone's. Besshois about to spike and Tsukishima is able to block it easily, which impresses the announcers. This is followed by Tsukishima noticing that two blockers had the reaction time to noticeAsahi's upcoming spike. Not long after,Suwasets the ball toHoshiumi. Tsukishima tries to determine when the perfect timing is to block him and when he finally does, he succeeds in blocking Hoshiumi and surprises the spectators. However, right after when Hoshiumi is matched up against Tsukishima once more, he gets past his block by directing his spike upwards. Not long after, Tsukishima and Yamaguchi notice that Hoshiumi hit it in the opposite direction which he was facing when he served earlier. When Tsukishima is about to spike the ball on the other side of the net from Kamomedai's all three blockers, as they are forming a stack block, he is shocked as they all have the speed to be able to get to his side of the net so quickly and block him instantly. Tsukishima then makes a mental note to askTakinouefor tapes of Kamomedai's other games later and turns toKageyamato tell him to stop running away to check on him, which extremely angers him, and Tsukishima gets annoyed when Kageyama indicates that he wants to pick a fight with him. Not long after, Hirugami deflects Tsukishima and immediately gets ready to block Hoshiumi preparing to spike but cannot do so as he spikes it way back over to Karasuno's backcourt. When Karasuno loses the first set, Tsukishima is exhausted at the idea that they'll have to play three sets again. Upon hearing this,NaritaandYamaguchilook at him silently untilSugawaraslaps his back and is excited at the idea that Tsukishima is determined enough to already think about the third set and upon him comparing Tsukishima to Hinata, Tsukishima says that sounds depressing, which offends Hinata. At the beginning of the second set, despite rooting for Karasuno, Tsukishima expresses irritation when Hinata jumps to the other side of the court and scores Karasuno a point. Not long after,Hakubaand Hoshiumi are being used as decoys forSuwato set forNozawa, which tricks Hinata, who has previously been tricking Kamomedai. Despite Karasuno having lost that point,Kenmanotices that Hinata has been getting smarter with his blocking but was still nowhere near Tsukishima's level. When Hinata is getting ready to block, he is about to get tricked by one of Kamomedai's decoys but was not fast enough to figure that out. Tsukishima mocks Hinata to himself that he had been too slow to figure it out and Yamaguchi tells him that they still lost the point. Not long after, Suwa sets for Hoshiumi but gets frustrated once he finds out it's too short. Despite this, Hoshiumi can still score with his block-out technique. Having conquered his block, Hoshiumi mockingly thanks Tsukishima for giving him such an easy and predictable target and trying to control his temper, Tsukishima in turn accepts the insult, which angers Akiteru. Continuing this, Karasuno's first years demonstrate great teamwork to win the rally and it motivates the team, including a previously distressed Asahi. Nearing the end of the second set, Hakuba blocks Hinata's first tempo attack during Karasuno's synchro attack. Despite this, Hinata's spirit is still not faltering, and Tsukishima sympathizes with how annoying he thinks it is. After this, Tsukishima thinks back at the moment when he found out about Karasuno's little giant, as well as Hoshiumi and Hinata, comparing them to monsters. However, Tsukishima still thinks that he can put up a fight as a mere human. Soon after, Tsukishima has to block Hoshiumi's spike, but knowing that he was going to use his block-out technique, he dodges the block for it to go out of the court. Tsukishima then smiles smugly at Hoshiumi, which angers him. After this, he silently does a discreet peace sign for Akiteru to see[20]. When Bessho, Suwa, and Nozawa all predict where Tsukishima is going to spike with read blocking, Tsukishima knows this and tries a cross-shot, but it goes out of the court and gains Kamomedai a three point advantage. After this, Tsukishima seems to be hitting the last points of his stamina, but he still tells Ukai that he can keep going; however, the coach wants him to rest. Into the third set, Tsukishima is rotated back in even though he's feeling exhausted, but he still refuses to let Hinata one-up him. Soon after, Nozawa spikes and Tsukishima can barely block it and he hopes that someone is behind him to receive that, and that person turns out to be Hinata. Despite this, Tsukishima still refuses to let Hinata surpass him and hits Kageyama's perfect set. When Hinata tearfully apologizes for not being able to take care of his health well,Tanakatries to be cheerful and compares his junior to a toddler. At this, Tsukishima tries not to despair as well and tells him that his ""mini stamina freak"" will be as good as ever after he takes care of himself. After this, the game resumes, Tsukishima sets for Tanaka. However, in the middle of the synchro-attack just following this, Tsukishima gets a leg cramp and fails the attack.[21] After their loss, Tsukishima tellsDaichithat he wants to watch Kamomedai's previous matches, Daichi exclaims tearfully that Tsukishima's grown so much, which confuses him."
What team does Tsukishima play for?,Sendai Frogs,Final arc,"Tsukishima is revealed to have continued playing volleyball after high school. He currently plays as a middle blocker for the Div. 2 team, the Sendai Frogs. At the same time, he is a college senior and plans to start working for the Sendai City Museum when he graduates[1]. Tsukishima joinsYamaguchiandYachiin watching the game between theAdlersandMSBY Black JackalswhereinHinatais making his debut. During a minor flashback when Tsukishima and Yamaguchi were having dinner together, Tsukishima questions Yamaguchi on why Hinata was trying out for the Jackals. When Yamaguchi answered that Hinata chose them because they were currently the best team having try-outs, Tsukishima commented how this was typical of Hinata to do and remembers when he had asked Hinata if he had been serious about switching to beach volleyball, learning that Hinata was doing this to become stronger so that a top tier setter would see he is worth setting to. As the players for both teams are being introduced, Tsukishima becomes uneased at seeingHoshiumiand that he still held the nickname The Little Giant. Yamaguchi playfully points out that Hoshiumi probably wouldn't be too happy to be reminded of Tsukishima. When the Jackals' starting lineup begin making their way onto the court, Tsukishima laughs hysterically whenBokutodoes cartwheels to introduce himself. When Hinata andAtsumuperform their new quick attack, Tsukishima has a thoughtful look on his face. After the second quick attack, Tsukishima comments that this attack seems even faster than the original. After Hoshiumi serves, Tsukishima notices Hinata move a few steps back. He suspects Hinata is doing this in preparation ofRomerodoing a block-out or spiking over the blockers only for the Brazilian ace to instead perform a feint shot. When Atsumu was later made to make the first touch, Tsukishima recalls the moment back during the First Year Training camp how Hinata expressed his desire to want to learn how to do everything. At this, he watches as Hinata sets the ball to Atsumu. When Yachi expressed how well Hinata is playing, Tsukishima agrees but adds that Hinata would need to be this good in order to have replacedOriver Barnesin the starting lineup. He listens with amusement as Yachi and Yamaguchi realize that Hinata has come to learn the tasks of a setter and a libero which add to his skillset and how this would make a difference in the Jackals plays since Barnes primarily uses power in his plays. After the Jackals win the match in the fourth set, Tsukishima tries to keep Yamaguchi and Yachi from attending his next match but is unable to stop them. He later is shown arriving at his team's practice and is asked byKentarō Kyōtaniif he would be watching Japan's match against Argentina. Tsukishima makes a cameo appearance when he is seen during practice withKoganegawa."
What is Tsukishima's biggest weakness?,he is lacking in stamina compared to his teammates,Statistics,"Tsukishima is shown to be immensely proficient at blocking primarily because of his height. It has been said byKenmathat Tsukishima is a calm and collected blocker who thoroughly analyzes his actions. This ability also allows him to perform split-second feints to surprise and put his opponents off-balance. After the final training camp before the spring tournament, he is able to match the power and speed of an adult, whereas before, he couldn't even hold the block. Potentially his biggest weakness is that he is lacking in stamina compared to his teammates and is shown to tire out more easily. This will occasionally affect his mindset as he will not be able to think as clearly as he wishes which may cause an error to occur. Height and reach, as of mid-November:"
What color is Rin's shirt?,red,Appearance,"Rin's attire in his debut Rin has messy, jet-black hair that sweeps down on his pale skin and intense blue eyes. Since using Kurikara for the first time, Rin began exhibiting a number of physical traits that hint at his demonic nature in his human form such as prominent canine teeth, slightly pointed ears, and a long, black, furry tail. In hisDemonform, Rin gains two horn-like blue flames floating above his head, long elven ears, and his prominent canine teeth become demonic fangs. His eyes change as well; his pupils become red and slitted, while his irises take on a jagged triangular shape and become a deeper shade of blue. The blue flames also blaze around other places of his body, mostly at the tip of his tail and on his shoulders, as well as his sword. Before going to theTrue Cross Academy, Rin's wardrobe consisted of a blue hooded sweatshirt over a faded red T-shirt, a pair of black jeans with chains on the side, giving the impression of a rebellious nature, and a pair of white sneakers. He was also seen wearing a white jacket with big pockets and various decorations on it and a pair of black fingerless gloves. Because of how often he got into fights, Rin was seen with band-aids over his cheeks and fingers, wounds which were usually taken care of byYukio. While in True Cross Academy, Rin wears the school's uniform, which consists of a white shirt, a loose necktie, a black jacket, and black pants. He is also seen carrying his sword,Kurikara, in a red sleeve with a cross-body black strap. In class, he is occasionally seen with his bangs pinned up so he can read his studies. Shortly after the new year, Kurikara is broken, unleashing Rin's full power. In his full demon form, he has pale blue hair that fades to white at the bottom. His eye colour changes from dark blue to the colour of his flames as well and his pupils become fully red, while his eyes gain the triangle-like shape that humans that are possessed by Satan have. He has two bumps on his forehead, alluding to growing horns. The new outfit he wears is a True Cross security uniform that can turn him invisible if the hood is put up, made by Mephisto himself. When his demon heart isn‘t hidden, it appears in a shape that reminds of an actual human heart. It is blue and it has some spikes on its top, that look like a crown. In the middle of this “crown“, there is a blue flame burning.
Rin looks very similar apart from his blue hair to his fathers, Satan's, host body."
What is the relationship between Rin and Yukio?,brother,Personality,"Rin and his friends. Rin has an extremely compassionate and supportive personality, and a kind heart. He supports his friends and tries to encourage and help them in any way possible. He is also very protective of Yukio and aims to surpass him one day. However, Yukio often finds Rin annoying due to his frequent impulsiveness, stupidity, and his care-free attitude, which makes Yukio look down on Rin as much as he looks up to him, making it hard for Rin to be taken seriously by Yukio and his fellow exorcists, making Rin desperate to earn his brother's approval. He takes offense when Yukio accuses him of killing their father and pointing a gun at him, warning him not to insult him and saying that he isn't going to fight his brother. Rin is also revealed to be emotionally fragile when Yukio begins to show signs of insanity and Rin can't find any way to help him. This is further emphasized when he learns the circumstances behind his birth and secretly believes that he should never have been born. Although he generally hides it, Rin lovedhis adopted fathera great deal and has nothing but good things to say about him. He deeply regrets that the last thing they did was fight, which resulted inSatantaking him over. Much like Yukio, he takes any insult against him very seriously and got really angry whenShuraclaimed he died like a coward. He also doesn't like people insulting Yukio, whom he loves and greatly respects. Besides this, however, Rin is surprisingly even-tempered and laid-back and rarely gets angry without a good reason. Rin is often shown to be able to relate to people easily and connect their feelings to his own, such as Shiemi Moriyama's grief over her grandmother and Ryūji Suguro's ambition to defeat Satan. He is also able to understand Shiemi's desperate desire for friends, as he grew up with no friends due to being constantly harassed by bullies, children, and rude adults alike. In general, he is often the first one to try and make people feel better if they're down. He's not the type of person for school or studying, though he was able to gain a junior high diploma and become an Exwire. Rin’s agressive nature. Unlike his brother, Rin is immature, which leads other people into believing that he is younger than Yukio. Rin can also be very violent and tends to get into fights . It's been noted by several people that despite being twins, he and Yukio couldn't possibly be more different. He is headstrong and is often very open with his friends. However, when his friends found out about his demon heritage, they become afraid of him, thinking that he is unstable which could lead to a catastrophic disaster, but they slowly grew close to him and accepted him during the Kyoto Arc. Despite his usual hot-blooded and obstinate attitude, Rin is often shown to be more sensitive than he lets on, which is shown when he is stuck in Mephisto's mechanical prison in the Kyoto arc when Shiemi tries to rescue him and he denies her, openly crying, afraid of himself. He is also shown to have a soft spot for animals. At the beginning of the manga, the reason he had gotten into a fight with Reiji Shiratori and his delinquent gang was that they were torturing pigeons. He also attempts to tame Kuro without killing him after hearing that he was once Shiro's familiar. However, it is shown frequently that there is a darker, more malevolent side to Rin. Once Kurikara breaks, Rin's demonic heart is returned to him, and there is another consciousness within Rin's soul. This one is shown to be notably megalomaniac, obsessed with its own power and destroying everything. In a way, it is a conscious manifestation of Rin's demonic power."
What did Shiro decide to seal Rin's Demonic powers within the Demon-slaying blade Kurikarawith the help of Mephisto?,Yuri's newborn twins,Anime version of rin's birth,"Rin as an infant During the time of theBlue Night,Satanmurdered a huge number of the world's greatest holy men, in order to find someone who he could possess without any ill effects to saveYuri Egin, who was going to be executed by the Vatican for being impregnated by him.Shiro FujimotoandMephisto Pheleswere ordered by Yuri's father,Ernst Frederik Egin, to go find and kill her and Satan's children. They found Yuri within the forest with her newborn twins, whom she named Rin andYukio. She later died in childbirth. Instead of killing the twins like he was instructed,Shirodecided to seal Rin's Demonic powers within the Demon-slaying bladeKurikarawith the help of Mephisto, and raise Yuri's children as his own. Mephisto then made a deal with Fujimoto that if he doesn't succeed in raising the twins as normal children and if Rin'sDemonpowers ever came out, they will be in his custody."
What does Mephisto show Rin?,"he is actually the King of Time, and one the princes of Gehenna",Shimane illuminati arc,"Rin protects Godaiin. Rin meets a boy in his regular classes atTrue Cross AcademynamedSei Godaiinwho recently developed an ability to see Demons. Rin decided to explain the existence of Demons to him but become curious when Godaiin claims to have never received a temptaint. He asks other Exorcist on Godaiin's behalf if there is a way for him to stop seeing Demons. MeanwhileArthur A. Angeleasily defeats the powerful Impure Princess, who has powers similar to the Impure King. He voices irritation over the fact that he was not called to upon to defeat the Impure King, and Rin was the person who defeated the Demon. Afterwards, he and several other Exorcist discover an artificialGehenna Gateand ask Mephisto if he can close it. Mephisto states he can slow its opening but cannot close the gate permanently. Mephisto Phelesinvites Rin to his mansion to celebrate Rin's execution being postponed. He then transports Rin toGehennaand reveals that he is actually the King of Time, and one the princes of Gehenna. Afterwards, he summons the Cuckoo Clock Amaimon was last seen in and allows Amaimon to briefly battle Rin. Amaimon releases his full power and seemingly wins rather easily before Mephisto ends the fight and transports Rin back toAssiah. Mephisto hints that Rin is not yet powerful enough to defeat Amaimon. Mephisto then shows Rin special eyewash that could help Godaiin but asks Rin to do an assignment for him. Mephisto once again congratulates Rin on his suspended execution and says Rin must master the Demon's etiquette. Later that night, Rin and his friends are tasked by Yukio to solve the True Cross Academy's Seven Mysteries . The first is a ghost in a wedding gown which does not bother women; thus, the guys try to get rid of it. They learn that the ghost is actually a male transvestite. Rin can't do anything because ghosts can't be hurt by physical attacks, and Suguro and Miwa's Aria is also ineffective against it. The ghost starts trying to kiss the boys and their formation falls apart; after seeing this, Nemu Takara turns his puppet into a male fashion doll and the ghost disappears with no regrets. Yukio then goes over the next mystery which is an evil ghost in the girl's bathroom and only appears in front of women. The next morning, Rin and Yukio have breakfast together. Rin asks Yukio if he is hiding anything to which Yukio says it's nothing. Shiemi stops by shortly after asking where Yukio is, and they wish each other luck on the mission. Rin and the other guys watch Shiemi and Izumo defeat the evil ghost. The girls laugh really hard seeing all the men dressed as girls. The next day, the Exwires take on two of the mysteries. The first is a statue of Mephisto that moves at night which is exorcised by Rin destroying it with his sword. The second mystery is an unmanned tram that is also solved by Rin destroying it. This angers Suguro the next morning, as he hates how Rin does everything by himself. Miwa then spots Godaiin who had been absent from school for a while, and Rin talks to him, then casually reveal he is half-Demon. After school, Rin and company go to the room of portraits as their next mystery. Mephisto substitutes for Yukio, who was sent to the Vatican, and reveals that this is the last mystery they had to solve as the other two were already solved by him. After they look at the portrait for a bit, Rin decides to slash it and starts to hallucinate. Miwa breaks the illusion and reveals that a shape-shifter has possessed the portrait. Miwa then starts pointing out everyone's faults and tells Rin that if he does everything, the rest of them will not be able to fight without Rin. Miwa devises a plan that uses everyone's abilities and as a team, they destroy the shape-shifter. Mephisto then gives Rin the eyewash and Rin quickly delivers it to Godaiin. He then asks if Rin is scared being half-Demon; Rin replies that he is but has great friends that help him deal with it. Youth! Rin sleeps in on Sunday morning and is surprised to hear Yukio will be meeting up with Shiemi. When he asks him if it's a date, Yukio answers ambiguously. Later, Rin sees Godaiin in class and learns that he hasn't used the eye drops yet. Later, Rin goes to Miwa and Shima's dorm and sees Miwa using a computer to analyze data about different Demons. Shima then mentions the school festival to which neither Rin or Miwa know anything about. Godaiin tells Rin about the food and the dance party; the latter freaks Rin out because a lot of great bands would be there but a female partner was required. Out of the Exwires, Izumo was the only girl they could ask because Shiemi wasn't a student at the academy; however, Izumo was more concerned with the Exorcist exam in the next 3 months than the dance party. Suguro felt the same about the exam, and Miwa wasn't interested in the dance. Shima then talks about how their first-year dance is more important than passing an annual Exorcist exam and tells Rin he will introduce his female friends. However, they have absolutely no luck with getting dates, even when they remember about Paku. They happen upon Suguro who turned down a girl and get angry at him. Suddenly, Shiemi appears and tells them she is now a student at the school thanks to tutoring from Yukio. Rin gets excited, believing he can invite Shiemi to the dance. He finds Shiemi in the cafeteria and asks her if they could talk. After he asks her if she knows about the dance, she tells Rin she was thinking of inviting Yukio. She explains that she noticed that Yukio has been really busy lately, and she thinks the dance could give him a chance to relax. Rin agrees with her and leaves. He is next seen in Miwa and Shima's room depressed about his Shiemi's rejection, while they try to cheer him up, failing to do so. In the next day, Shiemi tells Rin that Yukio declined, surprising him. He then runs away after she asks if he is thinking anything bad, leaving her confused. Izumo was taken by Renzou Shima, who turns out to be a spy for both the Order and the Illuminati. She is taken to her hometown of Inari, where the Illuminati have a temporary base. Yukio is put in charge of retrieving her along with the ExWires. The lab in the Illuminati base experiments on the tourists there to see the shrine. The lead scientist is a pig-like man named Michael Gedouin. Izumo's mother, Tamamo was possessed by the Nine-Tailed Fox, which we learn about when Mike, one of Izumo's Byakko familiars, tells the ExWires and Yukio Izumo's past. The ExWires and Yukio charge into the base, only to find it empty. While looking around, they discover a zombie with a collar displaying a label. Yukio shoots it, but it gets back up, unfazed."

Although they are twins, Rin was born first, leading to Rin being considered the older brother. They were conceived inSection 13during Satan's occupation of the Japan Branch of the True Cross Order.

The two search for Shura around Hachinohe Station and get a lead from a taxi driver, saying he drove her to Lake Towada.[13]Since the search is going long, Yukio and Rin find an inn to stay overnight. The innkeeper misinterprets their relationship, telling the two that she doesn't judge, arranges for a private bath so they won't be bothered, and sets up their bedmats next to each other. While Rin is oblivious, Yukio slowly realizes the misunderstanding and is mortified. While in the bath, Rin inquires about the ""dangerous training"". Yukio lies that it was target practice and immediately changes the topic, asking how Rin is doing. Rin tells Yukio that he confessed his feelings to Shiemi, but she views both of them as only friends even though Rin thought she romantically liked Yukio. Yukio laughs a little, saying Shiemi admires and looks up to him, but that she would despise him if she knew the real him. Rin asks Yukio directly if he romantically likes Shiemi, but Yukio brushes him off and goes to bed early. During the night, Rin tries to tell Yukio that he and Shiemi have noticed that Yukio's hiding something, that he's worried, and that Yukio can rely on him if things get rough. Yukio hears everything Rin says, but angrily pretends to sleep. The next morning, Rin and Yukio learned Shura stayed at the same inn. Yukio reads Shura's background with the True Cross Order, and the twins comment on how they never really knew much about Shura. Rin and Yukio travel to Towada Shrine, which is reportedly where Shura was found as a child. They find Shura's bloody body and take her back to the inn, where Shura shares with them the details of her ancestral contract that will end her life at 30. Yukio considers this information, observing that they have to getHachiroto abrogate the contract himself and briefly wonders about the contract's regenerative ability. Rin suddenly senses a presence and they find Shura gone. The twins arrive at Towada Shrine to find Hachiro controlling Shura and charge in. Hachiro pins Yukio, intending to control him to impregnate Shura. When Shura tells Hachiro to not do this, he tries to control Shura to do it instead, and is interrupted by Rin. Yukio tells Rin to stop trying to destroy Hachiro before they've dissolved the contract, and interrupts Shura's attempted suicide to resolve the situation. He then proposes to the hydra a new contract that solely benefits them and further restricts the Kirigakure bloodline. In this arrangement, Yukio gets the sword and regenerative ability originally given to the Kirigakure bloodline in exchange for bearing the next Tatsuko, since Hachiro is unable to do so. When Hachiro balks at the idea of Tatsuko aging once the contract is dissolved, Yukio proposes that he and an organization he founds carry the responsibility of executing each Tatsuko at the age of 30. As Yukio negotiates, he alludes to wanting power no matter the cost and remarks that the powers of the new contract would allow him to stand against Rin. Unable to take it any longer, Rin asks if Yukio's being serious. Yukio responds with the truth: he wants to be stronger, this power could allow him to try harsher training, and he doesn't need Rin's help. He draws his gun on Rin. As Rin says he won't shoot, Yukio shoots him in the head, neck and chest. Yukio remarks to Hachiro that'll keep Rin down for 20 minutes, and creepily tells Shura that she can be of use to him before she dies and he'll be good to her. Hachiro is pleased by Yukio's apparent depravity and agrees to his proposal. As Hachiro removes the contract from Shura and begins to transfer it to Yukio, Yukio signals Rin and Rin backstabs Hachiro. Rin praises his brother's deception, recognizing the nutrient bullets that Yukio used before on the plant demon, and also kicks Yukio for freaking him out. Enraged, Hachiro transforms into his true form as an enormous hydra and seizes Shura. Yukio yells at Rin for confronting him instead of finishing his attack. He also warns Rin to not look at Hachiro's eyes, which Rin immediately does and collapses. Upon Renzou's arrival to the battlefield, Rin warns Renzou of Hachiro's eyes and promptly fails that advice, much to Yukio's chagrin. When Hachiro attempts to drown Shura in Lake Towada on her request, Rin incinerates and explodes Hachiro's body while Yukio physically covers his eyes. Yukio insults Rin's technique name, but Rin says that Shura came up with the name to help him. When Shura resurfaces, Rin is exhausted. Fearing Rin running out of flames, Yukio asks Renzou to use Yamantaka to cut the tendrils holding up Shura while he catching her. Renzou notes how Yukio's acting unusually gung-ho today, while Yukio remembers his childhood thoughts on Shura and that he won't let her die. When Shura whispers for the group to stay back, Hachiro smacks away Renzou and attempts to constrict Yukio to death. Shura breaks out of Hachiro's grip and cuts Yukio loose, firmly rejecting Hachiro and declaring that she was going to live. Rin successfully attacks Hachiro and reduces him to a mere dumb snake. The battle ended, Yukio compliments Shura on her new short hair. She pokes him and taunts him with a new nickname based on his ruse, ""playboy four-eyes"". Shura brings Yukio and Rin in for a hug, thanking them. Alone and informed that he has a broken arm and broken ribs that require surgery, Yukio looks down on his chest and confirms none of the contract transferred. Renzou shows up behind him, commenting that it was a pity that Rin struck Hachiro too soon for Yukio to receive the contract's regeneration and power. Realizing Renzou had been watching them the whole time, Yukio asserts he was lying. Renzou counters that the best lies are based on truth. Getting angry, Yukio asks what he's implying. Renzou comments Yukio can't do his suicide training anymore with his injuries, revealing himself as Mephisto's informant, and reminds Yukio of his suggestion to get advice... or to consider just going to the Illuminati. Renzou excuses himself and Yukio collapses. Yukio wakes up in the hospital to see Rin cutting some apples. Shura informs him they operated on him and it'll take two months for rehab and recovery. While Yukio is dismayed by the time estimate, Rin tells him that this could be good time to rest and that afterwards Yukio can return to his ""whatever"" training. Putting down the cut apple, he encourages Yukio, much to Yukio's disappointment. Alone in the hospital, Yukio thinks about how everyone else cares for others while he's been so fixated on himself that he doesn't even notice other people. He silently resolves to have a broader vision. The Exwires visit Yukio in the hospital, who is already working . He thanks them for the visit. He also asks Shiemi about her meister declaration form, which she hasn't turned in yet. He tells her to consider seriously if she wants to be an exorcist. Yukio leaves the hospital a day early and visits the Exwires' table at lunch. When Rin tells him that he should rest more, Yukio said he had to catch up on work. He also reminds the table that semester tests are in three days, gently telling them to focus on their schoolwork as well as the exorcist certification exam. Yukio calls Rin away from the table and informs him that he just received a call thatTadashi Misumihas passed away. When Bon receives a text from Lightning and quickly excuses himself, Yukio notices. Rin and Yukio return to the monastery for Misumi's funeral. Yukio blandly acknowledges Rin remarks on how it feels like it's been years since Father Fujimoto's death. While walking alone through the hallway, Yukio overhears the monks recriminating themselves for letting Lightning in and Misumi's subsequent death, implicating Lightning in Misumi's death. On the morning of school exams, Yukio meets with the Exwires and asks Shiemi if she really has decided to not take the exorcist certification exam. Shiemi confirms this, shocking the group. She also strongly supports Renzou's suggestion of holding a big Christmas/Birthday party for all the Exwire's birthdays when winter break starts. When Yukio attempts to exclude himself, Shiemi strongly insists that Yukio has to come, surprising Rin and Yukio. Yukio counters many of the Exwires' wild speculations on why Shiemi is leaving exorcism, stating her health is fine and preventing Rin from asking her directly. Shiemi assigns the group various party preparation tasks. Yukio is paired up with Bon to make party decorations. Suspecting Bon might know something about Misumi's death, Yukio subtly asks him about his work with Lightning. Yukio complains to Shura about having to go to the party, preferring a mission and asking if she could take his spot. She declines since she has a marriage-hunting party, as she's looking for a life partner and is now taking care of her health. Yukio congratulates her on her new life choices, ticking Shura off. Yukio and Bon work together to make decorations, but Bon discovers that Yukio is an absolute disaster at arts and crafts. Yukio mentions that Shiro often had him and Rin make Christmas decorations for the monastery, encouraging quantity over quality so they never got better. Noting Bon's pained expression, Yukio directly asks if anything was the matter. Bon deflects and Yukio thinks about the times he'd ask Father Fujimoto about his and Rin's parents. Father Fujimoto would claim he found the twins on the morning of December 27 and immediately change the topic, while Rin would say that he didn't want to know. Yukio attends the party with the Exwires, although later he's non-committal about enjoying it. After the party as Rin cleans up, Shura reveals that she knew their mother and tells them her name: Yuri Egin. Yukio demands to know why she didn't say this before and wants all the details of how they met, while Rin tepidly agrees to hear it. As Rin and Yukio are resting in bed, Yukio asks Rin what he thought of Shura's story. When Rin simply says he's glad he knew she existed, Yukio directly asks if Rin wants to know about how they were born. Saying that all the information on her is classified and her reputation is as an apostate, Yukio declares he wants to know about her, their birth, and why everything was kept secret. Finally, he pointedly asks, ""but you don't really care, right?"" Rin affirms that, saying nothing good could come from knowing, that hearing she was kind on their birthday was enough, and tries to leave the room. Yukio snaps, getting up out of bed and angrily accusing Rin of cowardice. Surprised by Yukio's anger, Rin retorts what is the point of knowing and demands to know why Yukio wants to know. Yukio appears to realize something and says nothing. Then Yukio starts laughing, softly than loudly. He apologizes that he forgot what Rin said in the [[Terror of the Kraken arc]]: that the two of them can never change the way they think, they're both right and wrong, and that they're brothers but completely different. Yukio goes back to sleep and acts normal on the trip to Kyoto, but Rin is disturbed and feels that something is wrong. Yukio helps out with the preparations forJuzo ShimaandMamushi Hojo's wedding, making mochis despite how his arm is still in a cast. Yukio also spies on Bon, listening to his phone call with Lightning. Immediately before the wedding, Yukio is sitting next to Bon and he directly asks if him is investigating Father Fujimoto. He says he knows Bon and Lightning were at the monastery, that Misumi died soon after, and asks if Bon had anything to do with that. Bon agonizingly says he can't talk about it and apologized. Yukio appears to understand, smiling and apologizing for pressing so hard, since the investigation is top secret. After the ceremony when Bon excuses himself to receive a call from Lightning, Yukio sneaks up behind Bon, pulls him behind a door, and holds him at gunpoint. He politely asks for Bon to share what he knows. Terrified of the look in Yukio's eyes, Bon asks if Yukio is really going to shoot him. Shocked into sense, Yukio slowly draws back and holsters his gun. He apologizes, blames the alcohol, and asks Bon to forget this ever happened. Before he can walk away, Bon pulls him back and demands to know if anything happened to Yukio. However, Yukio just apologizes, smiles while asking Bon to let go since he's a superior officer. As Yukio walks away, Renzou blocks his path and calls out Yukio for threatening people rather than seeking advice. Yukio mocks Renzou's recommendation, saying advice doesn't solve anything since everyone is too different. A rise of demon incursions worldwide interrupts the wedding celebrations and the Exwires are recalled. Yukio excuses himself and uses a key to reach a mission in Ikebukuro, and is quickly followed by Renzou using another key. While Yukio is fighting ghosts and shadows raised by a broken Cenotaph, Lightning confronts him over holding Bon at gunpoint. Lightning tells Yukio that Bon requested he share information on their investigation, but that Lightning refused. Lightning asks why Yukio wants to know so badly. Yukio refuses to answer, leading Lightning to call him full of himself since Yukio clearly wants everyone else's secrets while keeping his own. As Yukio says he couldn't be as conceited as Lightning and walks away, Lightning remarks how you can't help someone who refuses to be helped. When Lightning is arrested for assaultingDrac Dragulescu, he feigns an escape, getting close to Yukio to whisper a strange phrase before he is taken away. Yukio discovers a USB drive planted in his pocket and realizes the gibberish was a password. Yukio asks for a computer, and opens the files on the drive. As he opens the drive, he recalls a time when he asked Father Fujimoto why he was raising him and Rin. Shiro declined, saying Yukio would learn eventually some day. Thinking that this might be the day, Yukio scours the files. While he learns about Section 13, their cloning projects, and that Shiro Fujimoto himself was a clone of Azazel, he finds none of the information he wanted. He slams the computer into a tree and returns to the mission. Infuriated by the Order's atrocities that he views as bad as the Illuminati and suspecting Shiro's intentions as an Order experimental subject, Yukio fights carelessly. Initially told he is relieved of duty since he's a minor and his arm is injured, he presses his CO to let him stay. His CO finally tells he was removed for recklessness and should go home and rest. Boarding a train, Yukio thinks of his orders and how he doesn't want to go home, laughing at himself for holding Bon at gunpoint for something so useless. He briefly hears a distant voice, but ignores it. Yukio finds himself atFutsumaya. He continues to recall the time when he confronted Father Fujimoto, having heard from Shura that Shiro said he was raising Rin as a weapon. After angrily questioning Shiro, he ran away and came to Futsumaya. While he sat on the steps in the rain, Shiemi found him and asked if he didn't want to go home. Yukio lied and said he was just taking a stroll in the warm rain. Before he can excuse himself, Shiemi says how much she loves being out in the rain too and joins him on the steps. She mentions how her mom sometimes criticizes her for not taking an umbrella with her, and asks if Father Fujimoto ever gets critical with Yukio. Shiemi then says that Yukio is so straight-laced, and it's okay for him to sometimes let down his guard and make mistakes. Lost in his thoughts, Yukio hears mysterious laughter. He turns to find the source, but instead sees Shiemi returning to Futsumaya. Shiemi is also reminded of when Yukio last showed up at Futsumaya late at night, saying she asked if he didn't want to go home back then. Yukio interrupts her saying that yes, he doesn't want to go home. Shiemi invites Yukio inside and serves tea. She asks him if anything happened and Yukio lies, saying he was just tired from work. Shiemi says what she said to him the last time he showed up late at night, that it's okay to loosen up sometimes. He turns to her and hugs her, apologizing and asking to just hold onto her for a moment. She reassures him. He tells her he feels all alone and that despite all his hard work, he has no place anymore. He tells her he doesn't have any decent family or a single friend. Shiemi emphatically denies this, saying she's his friend and starts saying Rin is worried about him. But the moment he hears Rin's name, he is enraged and shoves Shiemi to the ground, screaming that he didn't ask for Rin's worry. The two stare at each other in shock. Yukio pulls himself away and runs out the door, using a key to escape. Alone in the snow, Yukio mentally screams at himself for letting his issues hurt kind people. He slips and falls, and one of his guns slides out of it's holster. He grabs the gun, looking up to the sky, and reflects that he was weak and couldn't get stronger. He thinks how tired he is and attempts suicide by shooting himself in the head. However, the bullet is incinerated before it reaches his skull and his gun is blasted away. Blue fire pours out of his eyes as Yukio clearly hears a voice mocking him, asking him if he really thought he would be able to die so easily. Yukio screams in horror at the answer to the riddle behind his eyes: Satan. Renzou approaches Yukio, hunched over clutching his eyes, commenting on his new look. Yukio responds by immobilizing and knocking out Renzou. Later Renzou calls Mephisto when he wakes up and informs him that Yukio is really beginning to break. However, Yukio is already in the room with Mephisto, who is on the backstage of the Press Briefing Room at the Prime Minister's Residence preparing to give a nationwide statement on the existence of demons. Yukio confronts Mephisto, letting his exorcist ID card fall to the ground. When Mephisto plays coy, Yukio yells and demands an answer about what's going on with his eyes, which Mephisto observes are Satan blue. Yukio continues to demand answers, asking if he inherited the same flame that Rin did. Grinning a toothy smile, Mephisto says he refuses to answer. Yukio is stunned in rage and Mephisto leaves the backstage at his cue, saying he simply does not have the time to deal with children on journeys of self-discovery. Still backstage as Mephisto speaks, Yukio raises his gun at Mephisto and Shura sees him. Suddenly, Mephisto is shot in the middle of the forehead. The crowd erupts in chaos and Yukio lowers his gun in shock, since he didn't fire. However, he is arrested immediately on suspicion of being the shooter. Shura stays with Yukio as he is interrogated by the police, arguing that he can't be the shooter since the point of impact and Yukio's position don't match. Having received permission, the police release Yukio into the custody of the True Cross Order. Shura tells Yukio to get up and move, but he smirks. She pulls him up by his shirt, yelling if he understands the position he's in. Then she sees his eye, Satan blue again. Back at headquarters, Shura asks Yukio when the situation with his eyes began. He doesn't answer and only smirks when she says she wants to help him. She leaves and Yukio is sent to the Underground Confinement Tower. As he sits alone in his cell, Yukio reflects on all that has happened. He wonders if the Order will torture, experiment, or execute him, and that he can't let that happen. Satan comments that he could help Yukio out, but Yukio refuses and chooses to wait as he always has. The Exwires mount a rescue, raising a distraction and knocking out most of security. When Rin breaks into Yukio's cell, Yukio only smirks and goes with him. Along the way out, he takes a gun from one of the guards. At the bridge leaving the Academy, Rin hands Yukio a camouflage poncho, telling him they'll travel as far as they can and then talk. However, Yukio drops the poncho and doesn't move forward. Rin asks what's wrong. Yukio says he knew Rin would rescue him some time, but he arrived even sooner than expected. He wonders why Rin always is saving him and how they could be born so different. An Illuminati helicopter suddenly appears over the bridge. Yukio considers Lucifer's prior offer as Renzou repeats the Illuminati's invitation from the helicopter. Rin proclaims that Yukio would never join the Illuminati, Yukio turns his back on Rin and walks towards the helicopter. Yukio tells Rin the atrocities of the Order and how Shiro was created by their experiments. He observes how Shiro was raised to be an exorcist, and wonders if someone like that even had a human heart. Finally he says that Shiro was only raising them as weapons. While Rin doesn't understand this new information, he emphatically denies that Shiro was anything like that. Yukio acknowledges Rin's point, saying Shiro might have had some affection for Rin but only viewed Yukio as defective and an eyesore. Rin is stunned, thinking of all the ways he sees Yukio as better than him, and retorts that Yukio was ""perfect"" unlike him, that's why he and Shiro were so proud of Yukio. He says Yukio is not seeing things clearly and he'll make Mephisto tell Yukio what he wants to know. But Yukio declines and continues to walk away, saying he has no further ties here. Rin charges Yukio, ready to physically stop him, but Yukio whirls around to pull a gun on Rin. Yukio then repeats what he told Rin in Aomori, that he wants to be stronger and he doesn't need Rin's help, and shoots him in the same places: head, torso, and neck. As Rin feels the bleeding, he realizes the bullets were real, and starts thinking that maybehewas the one not seeing things clearly. Rin draws Kurikara, loses control, and attacks Yukio. As Rin brings the sword down on Yukio, Yukio reflects on Rin calling him perfect and thinks how from his point of view, Rin is the perfect one. Before the sword can strike, Satan reaches out through Yukio's eye and breaks Kurikara. Rin is knocked away from the blast and returns to his senses, surprised to see Kurikara broken and Yukio's eyes have changed. Yukio observes Rin's strong when he tries but immediately returned to himself because of his kind nature, showing his limits. Rin asks if Satan is possessing Yukio, but Yukio says he's himself and doesn't know how. As he continues to walk to the helicopter, Rin is immobilized by the pain of having his full power return to his body. Shiemi intervenes next, havingNeewrap Yukio in vines and saying he is not allowed to leave. However,Amaimonkicks Shiemi and the vines are dispelled. Disturbed by Satan commenting that Shiemi is an ""interesting girl"", Yukio blocks his left eye and tells Renzou to get them out of there. Yukio's last words to Rin are that he doesn't know what'll happen next, but in the unlikely chance that both of them survived to have a next meeting, he'd be stronger than Rin. Yukio leaves in the Illuminati helicopter as Rin yells after him. Renzou comments on how brutal Yukio was in his departure, saying going that far meant there was no going back."
Who is Yukio's assistant director of the Airborne Lab?,Egyn,Blue night arc,"Yukio and Renzou arrive on theDominus Liminisand meetHomare Todo, who commends Renzou for completing his mission of recruiting Yukio. Homare takes Yukio to Lucifer, where Yukio directly asks what Lucifer wanted from him. Lucifer thanks Yukio for bringing Satan to him, telling Yukio that he brought the world closer to true peace. Yukio calls that a load of crap, and calls out the Illuminati, Lucifer, and their plans as pure evil. But he tells Lucifer that he considers himself evil as well, since he'd thrown away everything for knowledge about himself. He finally says he'd do anything for the power that Lucifer promised. Yukio is given the clothes and title of ""Visiting Researcher"", since he didn't want to officially join the Illuminati. He meetsEgyn, Demon King of Water and Assistant Director of the Airborne Lab. Egyn says he will examine Yukio to see how he and Satan are connected, but Yukio refuses since he's seen the Illuminati's methods before. Lucifer says his reaction is understandable, one weak being to another, and says this is the first step to getting stronger. Yukio reluctantly goes along with Egyn's testing. While Rin is cooling his head in the modern era, Yukio receives his test results: he is human and not suitable for possession by any demon, ruling out possession by Satan. However, Lucifer orders his guard to fire a flamethrower at Yukio and demonstrates that Yukio is abnormally resistant to blue flames. Egyn suggests this is because Yukio shared the womb with Rin, and that Satan is using Yukio's left eye as a window to peer into Assiah. Egyn notes that Yukio's left eye shows signs of severe mashou, which is why Satan is restricted to that eye. Egyn also demonstrates Yukio is resistant to both red and black flames. Amazed, Yukio says this information alone was worth coming to the Illuminati. He thanks them and receives a tour around the airship. In the weapons lab, Yukio spots two guns. Wondering that it's true that tools can call out to their masters, Lucifer describes the guns as the test type and prototype of theArmumahel Pistols, which use crystalized Armumahel essence to injure demons. The leaked black flames can injure the wielder too, but that is no problem for Yukio who is resistant. Lucifer gives Yukio the guns, which unsettles Yukio but he thanks Lucifer anyways. Yukio is brought to a chamber full of clones of Lucifer, where Lucifer explains that the Illuminati completed the research began in Section 13. The combination of the elixirs and clone bodies allow him to persist in Assiah without deterioration. Lucifer offers to partially regenerate Yukio's arm, observing that Yukio needs both arms working to use the Armumahel guns. Yukio accepts. Walking down the corridor afterwards with Yukio, Renzou asks if Yukio's worried the Illuminati's lavishing him with gifts to get him to do something awful. Yukio says he is, but is going to use them as much as possible before that. Renzou suddenly remembers that he had to tell Yukio something, and whispers something in his ear. Yukio asks which side he's on, which Renzou flips on him. Alone in the shower, Yukio finds his left arm at full strength. He then begins to laugh. Renzou and Yukio meet up the next day and talk about the Illuminati's plans. Renzou privately shares with Yukio that Lucifer is changing bodies from the neck down routinely using technology that was only perfected a month ago. They eat lunch together in the food court. Yukio questions how the Illuminati's work is even possible, and Renzou says it's similar to how some guy once said awesome stuff can look like magic. Yukio recognizes what Renzou's saying as one of Arthur Clarke's three laws, that highly advanced science can only be recognized as magic. Saburota Toudou shows up at Yukio's table, greeting him and asks to join them. Lucifer also shows up and asks to join the table. Yukio is internally exasperated at the situation he's found himself in. As Saburota and Lucifer converse, Saburota notes Yukio's no longer eating and asks if the food agrees with him. Yukio claims he's just not hungry. Saburota observes Yukio still won't be honest. Yukio catches himself before he retorts, instead calmly calling Saburota's comment bullying and mirrors Saburota's earlier comment about the meal. Saburota again says he had hoped to see Yukio enjoying an honest and free life, and Yukio replies he's ""freer than ever before"". Renzou stifles a laugh. As Saburota is called away to prepare for the upcoming experiment, he tells Yukio that he will understand once he learns to be honest. Suspicious of how final everyone is acting towards Saburota, Yukio asks if he's going to die in the experiment. Lucifer says it all for their goal, which Yukio mocks and questions. Lucifer claims that his goal is to destroy the world and then re-create everything. He launches into a speech, saying those in Assiah are ignorant and spoiled while those in Gehenna are suffering. When asked if he agrees, Yukio says nothing. Yukio and Renzou approach the laboratory, which is sealed for the big experiment. Renzou tries to say Yukio has special permission from Lucifer, but the guards refuse. Yukio tells them to check directly with Lucifer, who gives him clearance to enter. Yukio sees the experimental apparatus and witnesses it incinerating the Chosen Ones, including Saburota. Egyn explains that the Chosen Ones were forced possession by high regeneration demons, giving their bodies ultimate regeneration. The furnace carbonizes the Chosen Ones to distill out their telomeres, which have unlimited cell division. Those telomeres are then used to stabilize a host. Realizing they are about to complete Satan's host, Yukio directly asks Lucifer for a clear answer on why he invited him to the Illuminati. Lucifer says it is purely because Yukio is a window to Satan and he wants Satan to witness. Having confirmed his use, Yukio begins to explain that he was invited to a senior-level conference, what they discussed, and that they made him sign aMorinath Contract. The contract begins to activate, as Renzou realizes he had passed along Lightning's message to Yukio that the Morinas can be used as a weapon. The Morinas Contract summonsVayuandIndra, high level kin of Azazel. The Morinas contract holder can determine what action happens when the contract is violated, either killing or protecting the signee. As the demons say they'll serve as Yukio's familiars until Lightning releases them, Yukio asks them to destroy the Dominis Liminis. Yukio taunts Lucifer, stating he'd always planning to backstab the Illuminati once he had what he wanted, and dares Lucifer to kill him. Lucifer flatly stares, inflicting damage on Yukio as Satan begins to retaliate. Homare slaps Lucifer to keep the airship from being destroyed. Yukio laughs that even Lucifer can't do it, and walks away. He grabs the Armumahel pistols from the locker with a smug expression. When Rin leaves the past, the key takes him to the airship where he sees Yukio holding a rebar spike over his left eye."
What does Yukio do when he is stopped by Rin's surprise arrival?,"Yukio is shocked at Rin's arrival and appearance. Rin says he used a key to see the past and invites Yukio to see it with him, which Yukio says doesn't matter anymore. Rin tells Yukio that he really shouldn't join the Illuminati, which Yukio says he didn't. Not seeing the problem, Rin tells Yukio that they can just go home then. Yukio glares at Rin and says he refuses to return to the True Cross Order, since they are corrupt and care only for self-preservation. He explains he came to this base to destroy the Illuminati, and that he must die to end the threat that Satan poses",Of one cloth arc,"Yukio remarks on a successful plan and the familiars destroy the airship. He recalls Shiro's lesson that victims of possession or parasitization can use shock therapy, inflicting enough pain to cause physical death and driving the demon to flea. Yukio picks up a rebar pipe and raises it over his left eye. He deliberately provokes Satan to distract him, asking him if he envies humans. Satan threatens Yukio that he'll re-enact the Blue Night and can kill him. Yukio finally says that he knows how Satan feels, pissing off Satan, and attempts to plunge the rebar into his eye. He is stopped by Rin's surprise arrival. Yukio is shocked at Rin's arrival and appearance. Rin says he used a key to see the past and invites Yukio to see it with him, which Yukio says doesn't matter anymore. Rin tells Yukio that he really shouldn't join the Illuminati, which Yukio says he didn't. Not seeing the problem, Rin tells Yukio that they can just go home then. Yukio glares at Rin and says he refuses to return to the True Cross Order, since they are corrupt and care only for self-preservation. He explains he came to this base to destroy the Illuminati, and that he must die to end the threat that Satan poses to the world. However, he demonstrates he can't do this himself, as Satan knocks away the rebar. Yukio says Rin might be able to kill him and asks him explicitly to do so. He mocks Rin's prior refusal to fight him, and tells him to get out of his way. Rin does not process any of what Yukio has said, taking it as Yukio not wanting to be looked down on. He punches Yukio into the wall, surprised by his own new strength. He tells Yukio that he always saw him as his weak younger brother, but will take him seriously if he wants. Rin declares he'll bring Yukio back home alive, while Yukio replies that he'll do everything he can to make Rin kill him."
How old was Yukio when he was trained as an Exorcist?,7,Meister & abilities,"While Yukio didn't inherit the sameBlue Flamesas his older brother, he was trained as an Exorcist by Paladin Shiro Fujimoto since the age of 7. Yukio has prodigious talent, earning his official license at the age of 13 in Dragoon and Doctor. He is proficient in martial arts, allowing him to restrain Renzou and fight on even terms with a de-powered and exhausted Rin. It is revealed through the manga that Yukio has unique eyes. They first turned blue and demonic during his fight againstSaburotain theKyoto Impure King arc,[14]causing the Demon Eater to instinctively retreat. Toudou later stated those eyes weren't Yukio's. The change occurred again when Lucifer confronted Yukio during theShimane Illuminati arc. Recognizing the occurrences happened when he was in fear for his life, Yukio attempts to investigate by deliberately endangering his life. After jumping off a roof, he blacks out to find himself on the ground surrounded by a significant crater. In a later attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head, his eyes change and Satan begins talking to him, using his flames to burn the bullet.[15]Satan also breaks Kurikara. Lucifer ultimately explains that Yukio's left eye is a window for Satan to view and interact withAssiah. Flame Resistance:Because Yukio shared the same womb as Rin, Lucifer stated he has an unnatural resistance to red,black, and blue flames to the point where he didn't suffer from the slightest burns after he was covered in red and black flames.[16]Because of this and Satan's protection, he had an almost unbreakable edge against Rin in their battle against one another because his fighting style revolved around his Blue Flames. Demon Form :Since the first anime outpaced the manga, a new story was constructed for the ending. In this filler, Yukio awakens his demonic heritage due to Ernst's machinations, granting him the same blue flames as Rin. Doctor: Yukio has top-notch medical skills and abilities. He is also a teacher of Anti-Demon Pharmacology. During the operation to retrieve theImpure King's left eye, he exposes himself to miasma without hesitation to treat an child infected with miasmatic boils. After briefly wrestling with himself due to Toudou's words, he stabilizes his hand and successfully injects the growths with vaccine without rupturing them.[17] Yukio with his guns Dragoon: Yukio's offensive Meister is Dragoon. His primary weapon is a pair of dual handguns, although he has also wielded a sniper rifle in theTerror of the Kraken arcand a shotgun in the anime-original ending. He is able to keep up withShura, an Exorcist 2 Ranks above him, in a combat simulation test. Yukio also uses different ammunition for elemental fights, such as using Naiad-blessed bullets to shoot a Karura-possessed Toudou. He is skilled in long-distance shooting, accurately shooting theKrakenclones at a great distance with a sniper rifle.[18]Lucifer gives Yukio theArmumahel Pistolsprototype, which uses crystalized Armumahel essence that can fatally injure even high-level demons[19]. Although Armumahel essence exposure damages humans and demons alike, Yukio's flame resistance allows him to use them without dysfunction. Naiad's Water dungeon Tamer: Although Yukio does not have aMeisterinTamer, he is able to summon multipleNaiads. However, his lack of stamina and experience in summoning Demons makes it difficult to maintain the summon for long periods of time. Saburota notes that Yukio is a novice at this."
How did Shiemi feel when she first appeared?,shy and quiet,Personality,"When Shiemi first appeared, she was a very shy and quiet girl at school. This is because when she was younger, she was awfully shy and sick, so she wasn't able to attend school, which made it hard for her to have friends of her age. Her love for her late grandmother made her want to never leave her garden, though she eventually did with help fromRin OkumuraandYukio Okumura. Shiemi is also very naive - most of her life was spent within the premises of her home, therefore she is rather clueless when it comes to typical adolescent experiences and grew up without any real friends. Her desire to make friends gets to the point that she considers herself to be too young for romance, saying that she just doesn't have the time or comfort level for a boyfriend, especially since she wants to focus on becoming an Exorcist. However, she is incredibly loyal, patient, and hardworking; she would do anything for her friends, even if it would make others feel uneasy. In one episode, when she aimed of having friends at school, she humbly asked Izumo then, but instead of hanging out with her and having fun, Izumo took advantage of her kindness by always asking her to run errands, turning her into a servant. This came to an end whenRin Okumuraenlightened her that friendship isn't supposed to be that way, respecting one another is more than loving a friend. Her exceptional kindness, immense willpower, and good nature have made her popular with the Exwires. It is observed that Shiemi first made friends withYukio Okumura, then Rin. In one of the episodes, she determines to herself: ""I've got to stop relying on Yuki-chan and Rin all the time. Today, I'll make some friends for sure!"" She is also an optimist and never gives up on her friends. She does not take criticism very seriously and always tries to help. Shiemi also has several odd habits, such as giving nicknames to various herbs and other plants. She once failed a test because she didn't use their real names."
What was Shiemi's grandmother's nickname?,"""Yuki-chan""",History,"Shiemi as a child When Shiemi was young, her mother was very busy with the Exorcist Supplies Store, so her grandmother took care of her. This nurtured a close relationship between Shiemi and her grandmother. Shiemi helped her grandmother in their garden and learned how and when to grow each plant. Her grandmother told her about the Amahara Garden, a garden created by god that has all the plants in the world. When Shiemi was about 13 years old,Shiro Fujimotobrought Yukio Okumura, a recently qualified Exorcist, to the shop. Yukio was very nervous despite encouragement from Shiro. Shiemi's mother called her to come meet Yukio and, after saying hello, Shiemi fled because she was shy. Later, as Shiro and Yukio were leaving, Shiemi reappeared and gave Yukio a four-leaf clover charm. However, she kept referring to Yukio as ""sensei,"" which he found to be too formal since they were the same age. At that, Shiemi gave him the nickname ""Yuki-chan,"" which made Yukio blush, but he accepted it. A year or so later, her grandmother needed help covering the grapes, but upon hearing that Shiemi had planned to search for the Garden that day, she told Shiemi to go but to be back before sunset. When Shiemi came back, she found that her grandmother had attempted to cover the grapes by herself and had been killed. Her guilt drove her to try to take care of the garden by herself, but there were some things she couldn't do on her own. She was approached by a Demon that had possessed a flower, and the Demon offered its help in exchange for Shiemi to stay in the garden forever."
Who is Shiemi summoning for help?,Nee,Exorcist candidate live combat arc,"Shiemi summons Nee for help During the camp the class attends during the Summer Vacation, Shiemi is attacked by Demon insects, and, after losing her familiar Nee, she loses consciousness after shouting for help. Rin dashes to rescue her and finds the insects swarming all over Shiemi's body. Seeing her head bleeding and her in an unconscious state, Rin yells out in anger for the bugs to get away from her, accidentally unleashing his blue flames. This was then spotted by Ryuji, who came to check on Shiemi as well, however, Rin was able to get out of explaining the flames that Ryuji had seen. When Shiemi awakens, she screams out for Nee, remembering what the moth Demons did, crying while holding Nee's ripped magic circle. But Ryuji assures her that she could use another paper to summon Nee again. WhenKonekomaru Miwatexted both Ryuji andRenzo Shimato help with thePeg Lanternhe found, Shiemi accompanied them along with Rin. For the strategy Konekomaru came up with to bring the Peg Lantern back to camp, Shiemi's part was being in the wagon feeding the Peg Lantern the moth Demons as fuel. She is later carried by Rin to move the Peg Lantern to the other side of the bank. She and her friends are successful in moving the Peg Lantern back to camp and shortly after are attacked byAmaimon. Later, Shiemi starts to walk out of the protective circle, surprising the others, and Shura sees a parasite in the back of Shiemi's neck.Amaimonappears and takes Shiemi. Rin follows after him, but Amaimon'sBehemothblocks his path. Shura gives Rin the koumaken and holds off the behemoth while Rin goes after Amaimon. Rin catches up with Amaimon and asks what he is planning to do with Shiemi, and Amaimon responds that he will make her his bride. After saying the vows, he prepares to seal them with a kiss but Rin stops him. As it becomes clear that Rin won't use his sword, Amaimon says that he doesn't need Shiemi anymore and prepares to take her eyes for an unnamed cousin. However, Ryuji, Konekomaru, and Renzo arrive and attempt to distract Amaimon to let Rin escape. However, Konekomaru accidentally sets off his firework and it hits Amaimon's hair spike, which makes it poof up like a broccoli, which Renzo laughs at. Amaimon takes offense at being laughed at and shoves Renzo into a tree, knocking him unconscious. He then breaks Konekomaru's arm and takes Ryuji in a chokehold. Rin, angry about seeing his friends harmed, unsheathes his sword, revealing his identity, and engages in battle with Amaimon who releases Shiemi."
How does Shiemi apologize to Rin? Choose your answer from: (A). (B). (C). (D). (A). (A). (B). (C). (D).,(A).,Kyoto impure king arc,"Shiemi apologizes to Rin When on the Kyoto mission, Shiemi is still rather confused about not knowing that Rin isSatan's son. In the inn, she constantly helps out the others to preoccupy herself. She is less confident about her abilities, as she is unable to summonNeeafter having Nee's summoning paper ripped by a demon at the training camp. In a short confrontation with Izumo, she breaks down and confesses that she is upset about being unable to support her friends when they need it the most, especially about not knowing the troubles that Rin and Yukio kept for being Satan's spawns, despite having been close with them. She wishes to be a stronger person so that she can be relied on to help others when they are in need. Izumo bluntly calls her a ""weed"", claiming that Shiemi is as ever-intruding as a dandelion that carries its seeds and disturbs other plants' growth upon landing in the ground. Shiemi takes this as a compliment, thinking that Izumo was saying that she was persistent and persevering. Later, she, along with the other Exwires, is asked byShura Kirigakureto break Rin out of prison, giving them all camouflage ponchos, which makes them invisible to others when worn. When the Exwires successfully get past the prison guards and find the Demon prison cell Rin is locked in, she is the only one who is not petrified by the Demon, as she has no weapons and no intent to cause destruction. Then, remembering being told by the Demon that it can be opened from the outside without a key, she opens the door and goes inside in search of Rin. When she finds him, she tells him why she was there and that everyone else had also come to save him. When she tries to get closer, he yells at her to stay away, saying she could die if his flames go awry, and that he, himself, would be better off dead. Surprised and angered at this, she yells at him to not speak like that and that she wants to help him, to which he lashes back and yells at her to go home and calls himself a monster, letting out an outburst of blue flames. At that moment, as the flames engulf her, she realizes she is not burnt but rather only feels the warmth from them. She sees that he is trying to be considerate of his identity as Satan's spawn and that the flames were an attempt to scare her off. That demonstration of selflessness from Rin makes Shiemi realize she never really thought of Rin's feelings and that she only always thought of herself. She tears up and runs over to hug him, consoling him that his flames did not burn her. He backs away, blushing furiously, asking if she's not scared of him, to which she replies happily that she is not, ending up in their reconciliation. Together, they break out of the Demon's prison and rescue the rest of the Exwire team."

His hardworking streak comes from the desire to defeat Satan for turning his temple into a cursed temple in the eyes of the public. He is known to dislike people who do not work hard and slack off during classes, such as Rin who occasionally sleeps in class, Ryuji telling him to ""just get lost"" because everyone in class is serious about being an Exorcist.

When he was just starting as a shinki, he was shown to have no talent but is currently a blessed shinki, meaning he is hardworking and his loyalty and care for Veena motivated him to be the best shinki he could. He is a kind person in general and a good teacher, as he willingly teaches Yukine some techniques as his fellow blessed shinki. Despite his serious nature, he is shown to have a comical side, particularly when it comes to his loyalty/crush/mild obsession with Bishamonten. He also enjoys teasing his friends such as Yukine and Yato . His actions in the past, of ordering Yato to kill Bishamonten's shinki clan, still haunts him. He feels like trash for not telling Bishamonten the truth and for feeling good about her needing him and having to rely on a Nora to save Bishamonten. He is very knowledgeable about his duties as a shinki and about techniques to use as a blessed shinki, despite most likely not having a teacher. He is very analytical of Veena's battle situations and does his best to guide everyone to make sure they can help Veena to the best of their abilities. According to him in chapters 35 and 40, this is because, as he has stated: ""to be in total control of a situation, you must have confidence in yourself."" Despite showing pride in his abilities, he is not arrogant about them and does his best to continue improving himself for Bishamonten's sake. In order not to blight his master, he is shown to suppress his feelings and not feel guilt for his actions, no matter what they be. He tells Yukine this is because if he doesn't feel guilty for his actions then what he does isn't a sin and won't blight his master. Furthermore, he claims that he's imperfect and has regrets. However, he felt that he did the right thing and so it was not a sin and doesn't warrant anyone's criticism, something Yukine found to be extreme. His loyalty to Bishamonten can go to extremes as he was willing to slay his fellow shinki to save her, even in the present as he murderedTsuguha. He also usedBindon Yukine to force him to reveal the location ofthe sorcerer. Despite knowing doing so would endanger Yato's health, breaking off his good relationship with Yukine who now considers him an enemy."
When was Meliodas the leader of the Ten Commandments? Available choices: (A). When he was the leader of Danafor's Holy Knights. (B). When he was the leader of Danafor's Holy Knights. (C). When he was the leader of Danafor's Holy Knights. (D). When he was the leader of Danafor's Holy Knights.,(D).,Appearance,"Despite having the appearance of a child, Meliodas is much older, being more than three thousand years old. He is exceptionally short compared to other characters, with messy blond hair with jaw length side bangs with two cowlicks pointing in opposite directions and emerald eyes. He also lacks facial hair, further accentuating his adolescent appearance. Regardless of his stature and youthful looks, he is relatively muscular, possessing an array of well-developed abdominal muscles. He often wears an ordinary, clean white button-front shirt and a black sleeveless vest on top with a loosely worn tie. HisBroken Sword's scabbard is held on by a green leather belt with gold-colored buckles. Without any socks, he wears a pair of black boots. His most distinctive trait is his Dragon symbol carved at the top of his left bicep, just below his shoulder. When Meliodas was the leader of the Ten Commandments, he wore a white, sleeveless coat adorned by a batch of black X-shaped buttons from all around the high collar, black lining on the coat, a dark red color on the inside, and a coat's tail. He also had black pants with matching colored boots. Meliodas also wielded a large, yet sleek sword, but during his battle with Elizabeth against the Demon King andSupreme Deityit was destroyed. During his tenure as the leader ofDanafor'sHoly Knights, Meliodas wore their traditional armor, much likeCain Barzad's. Ten years ago he wore a full-body silver armor with a unique helmet, like the rest of the Sins. He also wielded a dagger that appeared to be his Sacred Treasure. Meliodas was issued a wanted poster, like the rest of the Sins, after being framed for the murder of Great Holy KnightZaratras. The most current issue of his wanted poster does not accurately depict him but, coincidentally, does depict his brother,Estarossa. After theKingdom Infiltration arc, Meliodas sports a new outfit; a long-sleeved, high-collared white tunic over an undershirt, a pair of gloves, knee-length black pants, and black boots. This outfit is a bit more formal like a uniform with the ""Boar Hat"" embroidered on his back. After his time in Purgatory, Meliodas now has seven permanent scars where his hearts are located and sports a new Black Mark similar to the one he previously had as leader of the Ten Commandments. He now wears the debut outfit he previously wore. In his Assault Mode, Meliodas shroud himself in darkness. This takes the appearance of a vest-like coat that only covers his armpits, which flares out at ragged ends, and has a very high collar which is spread wide. He also has two wrist bands, made up of the same darkness as the rest of his clothes. His pants are connected to his feet look like a bird's talons, but with five toes. In Purgatory, Meliodas' emotions wear a V-neck blue vest, made with the skin of indigenous species, that has three silver diamond-shaped buttons; the vest covers his shoulders and slightly exposes his chest with a small up-turned collar, and slightly opens at the hem. The blue gloves and knee-length pants have a leather-like appearance to it, and both have the same diamond-shaped button on it. Meliodas also seems to wear shoes, rather than his usual choice; boots. After absorbing all the Commandments and becoming a vessel for theDemon King, Meliodas' body became that of a tall and muscular adult with long hair, a white full-body leotard, golden boots, and gauntlets and two long, clawlike protrusions coming out of a dark matter accumulated on his back. He also has several black marks around his body, including his dragon's symbol on his shoulder. After the Demon King was driven out of his body, Meliodas returned to his previous appearance. Meliodas also achieved a new form similar to when he was possessed by his father.[9]However, the power was lost when he sacrificed it to destroy the Commandments forever. Image Gallery"
What does Meliodas do when his customers vomit onto the Boar Hat's floor?,instructs Hawkto clean up the scraps,Personality,"Meliodas' dominant traits are his frankness and his utter fearlessness, shown when he remains composed seeing the Rust Knight who was later revealed to beElizabeth Liones.[10]Due to his horrible cooking, when his customers vomit onto the Boar Hat's floor, he instructsHawkto clean up the scraps and scares him by saying phrases such as ""roast pig"" if he complains, hinting he may roast the talking pig.[11]He is also shown to be very bawdy and loves to frequently tell jokes. Occasionally, he takes advantage of Elizabeth's naivety and gropes her breasts, not even ashamed of doing so in public or in front of her father. He also has a strong sense of justice and is willing to help people in distress. Even when he is severely injured, he tries not to show weakness and stays strong in front of his companions. He holds resentment for himself, deeming himself a failure as an older brother toZeldrisdue to the suffering he caused him. Despite his title as the Sin of Wrath, he maintains the facade of a very calm person. However, if his companions or friends are harmed in any way, he is shown to be capable of extreme rage. He is also enraged when someone tries to take his sword, with this rage being capable of scaring even aHoly Knight[12]and causing him to leave a permanent scar onBan's neck, despite his regeneration abilities.[13]It has been hinted that Meliodas is guilt-ridden over the fate of Danafor, saying that his sin was being unable to save the kingdom. Ban and Cain point out that Meliodas tends to be soft and naive, due to him never killing anyone, even someone likeGuila, who was a serious threat to the group. Meliodas dislikes killing, preferring to be merciful. Despite all of this, however, Meliodas' personality was once much darker and terrifying, as he was revered to as the vilest and most terrifying demon in existence and no other demon would dare challenge Meliodas when he was the leader of the Ten Commandments and heir to the throne. Although not much has been shown of how he was, Meliodas displays a harsh, arrogant demeanor towards any lesser demon, coldly telling Bellion to get lost and calling him a hindrance and not even bothering to give him another thought as he began his battle with Mael. He is not intimidated by any Goddess except perhaps the Supreme Deity, doing battle with them relentlessly each day and he also does not fear even the mighty Four Archangels, as he is aware of his strength dwarfing theirs and rivaling, if not, surpassing even the mightiest and the fact that even they fear him, as shown by how he does not at all look fazed at the idea of battling Mael. However, even while in such a state, Meliodas still had doubts about the war but due to his loyalty to his father, he never once faltered whenever doing battle with the Goddesses. His angry reaction when the Demon King called him a destroyer for his plans to make his true self King of the Demons strongly implies that even in his prime, his father was still more demonic than he ever was. In the end, it was this aspect that allowed him to fall in love with Elizabeth and eventually abandon the Demons for her, choosing to stop the meaningless war. Whenever using his Demon Mark, Meliodas' personality changes to be similar to that of his old self, becoming cold, quiet, ruthless, and murderous as he kills and attacks anyone near him without mercy aside from Elizabeth. Despite being renowned as a pervert, the Seven Deadly Sins reveal that Meliodas never displayed any interest towards other females before meeting a grown Elizabeth. After his time inPurgatory, due to having lost some of his emotions, Meliodas' personality changes drastically whenever he uses the black mark, becoming far more ruthless and at times even sadistic in his battles and wasting no time in his attempts to kill his former demon allies. He states that his outlook has changed and is merciless in his battle with Monspeet and Derieri. During his fight with Fraudrin, he sadistically toyed with his historic enemy using a clone with half his power to give Fraudrin false hope of defeating him, relishing his despair upon realizing Meliodas' true power. In the aftermath of the battle, Meliodas professes to Elizabeth that he is genuinely terrified of becoming that person again. Beneath Meliodas' frank and bawdy demeanor hides immense amounts of emotional pain from having witnessed Elizabeth die over 106 times. Due to this, Meliodas has no fear of death and intends to lift his and Elizabeth's Curses, which he calmly admits will kill him for good, to free himself and Elizabeth from the torment and so they can be reunited in the afterlife. Upon releasing his demonic powers in a desperate attempt to escape Melascula'sAntan no MayuMeliodas fully reverts to his old self as the leader of the Ten Commandments. With his old personality in control, Meliodas has been seen to be easily annoyed and angered, being far more brutal, sarcastic, sadistic, and cruel than ever, showing visible pleasure and clearly mocks Escanor while easily beating him up. He also looks down on humans like most demons, as evidenced when he called Escanor a lowly human. He has also been seen to enjoy fighting, as evidenced by the fact that he toyed with Escanor rather than simply immediately going all out and killing him. While arrogant, he is not above complimenting his foes if they are truly powerful, as when he openly praised Escanor for putting up a fight against him. This arrogance is well-known to the Demons, as shown by how Zeldris stated that the only reason Escanor was able to defeat Meliodas was because Meliodas had a bad habit of toying around with opponents to mock them even if they proved to be very formidable and noted that he deserved his defeat at Escanor's hands due to it. Upon regaining consciousness after being defeated by Escanor, Meliodas regains his memories of Elizabeth and the Seven Deadly Sins. However, he had become solely devoted to breaking Elizabeth's curse and no longer cares about opposing the Demon Clan, even going as far as to ally with his former enemies and even become Demon King to accomplish it. With most of his emotions taken, Meliodas has gained a much calmer and collected attitude with no trace of his old frankness and is also much harsher and straight-to it, as shown when arriving on Camelot and confronting Zeldris and Estarossa, where he sternly says that both Elizabeth and the throne of the Demon King belongs to him alone and had no qualms pinning them down powerfully to make them submit to him. He does, however, retain some level of mercy towards the Seven Deadly Sins as rather as simply killing them, he offered them a chance to stand down and admits that the days he spent with the Sins were not all bad. He also offered Arthur, who he once acted as a mentor to, a chance to leave Camelot Castle on his own will, although he did so harshly, ruthlessly telling him that it is no place for humans like him anymore, and he has left the Sins, and had no qualms engaging him when he refused. He is not above making deals with others rather than simply forcing them to do what he wants or getting rid of them, as he promised Zeldris that he will fulfill Zeldris' desire if he agrees to help rather than just killing him ruthlessly or beating him until he submits. He also appears to still have affection and attraction towards Elizabeth, as he went out of his way to say when Estarossa said that he wants her that Elizabeth is his alone and patiently tried to make her understand that becoming the Demon King is the only way to save her, but he can now easily become rude at her, as he coldly told her that he felt nothing when she hugged him and had no qualms trying to force her to understand why he must become Demon King by saying bluntly that the only thing he had left is the promise he made to her and even told her openly that he considered her love for him to be imprinted by the Supreme Deity and not by her own will, a fact that he seemed bitter of. He apologized to Zeldris for being such a bad older brother, proving that his emotions were not completely gone."

After he arrives and knocks one out, both the knights and Diane tell Meliodas to leave. The Knights also say that Meliodas should not help Diane since she is a monster, to which Meliodas responds that it was wrong for them to pick on a girl. He defeats them all with ease after the rude comments. Meliodas later asks Diane if she had been frightened, which surprised her since she was bigger than him, This eventually led to her falling in love with him due to his kindness and treating her like she was a normal person. After Diane got arrested by the Holy Knights, Meliodas frees her by the order ofKing Bartra. At some point during this period, Gowther is also recruited into the Seven Deadly Sins, however, the exact details of his recruitment, as well as whether he was recruited by Meliodas himself or by Merlin are currently unknown. Also, around this time, Meliodas and Merlin meet Escanor and convince him to join as the final member of the Sins, although the two were forced to restrain him by order of the king to stop his havoc. Meliodas made sure that Liones exculpated Escanor for terrorizing the villages, hurting the Holy Knights, and disrespecting King Baltra. However, Escanor did not feel able to join them because his lack of control with his power only harmed those around him. Hearing him say that he thinks he deserves only to die, Meliodas tells Escanor that they would have a fight at noon to decide, that he will join the Sins if he loses. Although Escanor reaches the pinnacle of his power at noon, Meliodas manages to defeat him by releasing his Assault Mode. Meliodas then tells him that he feels pain because he is alive becauseRosasaved him by sacrificing her own life, but if he wants to die so badly then there is no point in speaking to an arrogant dead man. Escanor finally tells him that he wants to live, to which Meliodas tells him that if he can't keep those thoughts in check, he will be there to do it instead. Meliodas would fight with Escanor multiple times after this so that he would learn to control his power. With this, the formation of the Seven Deadly Sins becomes complete, with the Sins becoming the highest order of knights in the kingdom of Liones, answering directly to the king himself, and also to the Great Holy Knight, Zaratras, with the great holy knight being their only superior besides the King himself. After the formation of the Seven Deadly Sins, Meliodas and his team participated in various missions; a notable one being to purge theKingdom of Edinburghafter it was invaded by theVampire Clan."
What is the name of the goddess who took possession of the Troll Queen's body and brainwashed the other trolls to take over the altar and take advantage of the connection of its with the Celestial Realm to free the goddesses and take control of Britannia?,Jelamet,22 years ago,"When the trolls and their queen came and attackedIstar, Meliodas and the other Sins went in place of Hendrickson to take charge. The Druid headsJennaandZaneriimmediately recognize him as a member of the Demon Clan and threaten to expose him. However, Meliodas also realizes they are part of the Goddess Clan, so both parties decide to keep the identity of the other secret. Although Jenna refused to trust Meliodas, Zaneri accepts that they help them with the trolls that had taken control of the altar of Istar. Once they cross the spring to enter the underground cave where the altar is, Meliodas and Ban compete over who will fight a troll and kill it by accident. Seeing how strange magic leaves the body of the troll, Meliodas realizes that it is the power of a Goddess. When Jenna and Zaneri appear after following them, Meliodas saves Zaneri from the attack of another troll and tells them both that it is better for them to leave, because the trolls are being controlled by a Goddess. When Meliodas reaches the altar, everything is revealed to be the work of a goddess,Jelamet, who took possession of the Troll Queen's body and brainwashed the other trolls to take over the altar and take advantage of the connection of its with the Celestial Realm to free the goddesses and take control of Britannia. Both Meliodas and Jelamet recognize each other as the son of the Demon King and Elizabeth's old friend. Jelamet declares her intentions to kill Meliodas and take his head to Elizabeth, but Zaneri tries to reason with her. However, Jelamet dismisses her and Jenna as defectors and usesJob no Shirento steal Zaneri's voice and Jenna's sight. Meliodas orders that she undo her magic and hit her with a simple clap that sends her flying. Jelamet manages to useArk, but Meliodas only insists that he release Jenna and Zaneri. Jelamet refuses to accuse them both of treason for defecting and protecting him, crying out for her hatred towards Meliodas because of Mael's death. Zaneri manages to attack Jelamet with a lightning bolt that frees Meliodas from theArk, who asks her forgiveness for not being able to stop the Holy War. There,Escanorappears and when she feelshis magic, Jelamet confuses him with Mael. However, seeing that it is Escanor, Jelamet understands that it is not Mael. Escanor tries to kill her, but Meliodas stops him. There, Jelamet assumes that Mael died. Thus, Jelamet leaves the Troll Queen's body and decides to return to the Celestial Realm and sleep alongside her brethren until the time her heart is relieved of grief. Despite recovering the altar, Diane and the other Sins appear and destroy it, wanting to end the Troll Queen."
What did Gilthunder believe he would never become as strong as the Deadly Sins or his father?,"""The Way of the Knight"" creed",21 years ago,"Meliodas teaching Gilthunder words of courage Before they were infamously framed, Meliodas was trainingGilthunderuntil Gilthunder grew upset as he believed he would never become as strong as the Deadly Sins or his father, but Meliodas told him to ditch his negative attitude and Margaret came and told him ""The Way of the Knight"" creed. Margaret told Gilthunder that he should be himself, and not like the Deadly Sins or his father, and she believed that Gilthunder would be the kindest and strongest Holy Knight someday which cheered up Gilthunder. However, the next day Gilthunder came running toward Meliodas and told him to run away with the others. Meliodas was lost at Gilthunder and told him to explain everything, but Gilthunder told him something terrible was coming and if he told anybody, bad things would happen, and Gilthunder had no idea what to do. Meliodas told Gilthunder to calm down by hitting his head and asked him what he wanted to do, to which Gilthunder answered that he needed to protect Margaret, but had no idea how to do it. Meliodas taught him a charm that could cheer him up whenever he felt sad or terrible which was to say out loud that he was stronger than any of the Seven Deadly Sins. Gilthunder said it, to which Meliodas pointed out that he should feel better soon. Meliodas embraced Gilthunder, told him he should not cry, and if he were in trouble, he would come to his aid. The Sins surrounded by the Knights of Britannia When they were still an active and commended group of knights, they supposedly summoned to an old castle after defeating the troll queen and destroying the Great Druid Altar. As the Sins were inside the castle, they discussed among themselves the reason behind the order they received as Meliodas complained that they should be attending Liones' National Foundation Day Festival and go drinking only for King to remind his captain that he was always drinking anyway. After Diane and Merlin speculated whether their superior might reward or scold them for their last mission, Meliodas had already decided that it was a scolding and reminded his team to attend the festival later, much to his team's chagrin. As they entered the room, they discovered the Great Holy Knight, Zaratras completely skewered to death. Soon, they were framed for the murder and then surrounded by over three hundred knights of the kingdom. As the Liones' Holy Knights attacked the castle, Meliodas gave his team his last orders: to disperse and regroup later to figure out the cause of Zaratras' death, which everyone obeyed and separated while fighting their way out. In the aftermath,a little girltries to help the Deadly Sins to escape, but end up getting heavily injured and leading to Meliodas unleash his rage once more, but soon knocked out by Merlin and sealed away his strength, but Meliodas soon forgot the event which leads him to suspect the existence of a traitor.[19] Once Meliodas awoke, he came to meetHawkwithin a cave that was close by toCamelotas the two ended up speaking with one another, where Hawk mentions that he felt like he used to fly in the sky, thinking he was a Dragon back in his past life when Meliodas thought he wasWandle. The two argued over Hawk's name until Hawk mentioned a restaurant named Pig Leg where Hawk loved the leftover, which led Meliodas and Hawk to team up and work together since Meliodas can not work as a knight anymore. They decided to open a bar onHawk Mama's back, named Boar Hat, after the restaurant Hawk mentioned, by having Meliodas sell his Sacred Treasure, which he felt bad about since King Bartra had given him this weapon. Since then, Hawk and Meliodas have become business partners, Meliodas being the owner while Hawk is the cleaner as he could eat the leftovers."
"Who was the original wielder of the Commandmentof Love,Jiai?",Meliodas,Abilities,"As the former leader of the Ten Commandments, Meliodas was the original wielder of theCommandmentofLove「慈愛,Jiai」, which was bestowed upon him by the Demon King.[35]Those who would stand before him with hatred in their hearts will be rendered powerless to harm or inflict damage on anyone else. To ally himself with the Goddess Clan, he willingly abandoned his Commandment during his betrayal of the Demon Clan. Due to Gowther's forbidden spell, the Demon King gave the Commandment to his supposed second son: Estarossa, who was Mael turned into a Demon due to the Commandment given to him and thus making it look like the former killed the latter. After completing the ritual to become Demon King via absorption of all the Commandments, Meliodas held all ten Commandments but upon forcing the Demon King out of his body, the Commandments were also forced out."
Who is Elizabeth Liones?,the third adoptive princess and current queen of the Kingdom of Liones,English voice,"Elizabeth Liones「エリザベス・リオネス」 is the third adoptive princess and current queen of theKingdom of Liones, the 107thand final incarnation of theGoddess Elizabeth, the wife ofMeliodas, and internim captain of theSeven Deadly Sins. She is the deuteragonist of the series. Originally an alleged survivor ofDanafor's destruction, Elizabeth was adopted and raised by the kingBartra Liones. After theHoly Knightsrebel, she sets out on a journey to find theSeven Deadly Sins, becoming a waitress for Meliodas' tavernBoar Hat.[5]She later awakened as aGoddessand become the Seven Deadly Sins' most prominent ally, participating in their battles against theTen Commandmentsand later theDemon Clanin theNew Holy War."
What is Elizabeth's attitude towards the Seven Deadly Sins?,"very polite, grateful and caring",Personality,"Elizabeth is a very polite, grateful and caring individual who prefers a rather peaceful, diplomatic approach, even during war. She often shows a calm yet incredibly warm attitude towards others, helping them as much as she can and offering home to strangers. Despite there being several bad rumors about them, Elizabeth shows a lot of respect and trust towards the Seven Deadly Sins, even addressing them with the titles 'lord' and 'lady' at first. She is very open and tends to cooperate with others quite well, all in order to surpass their goals and return to their beloved ones. Elizabeth is very fragile, being easily injured by two ofRuin's attacks. Despite this, Elizabeth has shown to be very brave and courageous. Her selflessness and bravery are seen when recklessly tried to rescue a child fromStorm Rondo, which earned her respect from the Deadly Sins. More often than not, her determination acts as an inspiration to others.[7]She is also optimistic as she believed that everything would be alright during the battle in Vaizel. Furthermore, Elizabeth has become very strong-willed prior toDana's case, even remaining determined to stop the Holy Knights despiteVeronica's apparent death and only cried when alone to not let others see her tears and running the Boar Hat with the same as Meliodas when he died despite being devasted and hoped one day he would come back. Elizabeth initially had relatively low self-esteem and self doubt, often feeling insecure about being powerless and not being useful to her friends in battle. After Liones was set free and Meliodas didn't want her to continue to travel with him for her own safety, she grew more determined to become stronger and unlock her hidden powers in order to help everyone and no longer be useless, automatically willing to go through with doing so the momentMerlinpoints it out. After departing from Istar, she vows to be more confident in herself and never complain about her flaws again. Since then, she has become less timid, more independent, more assertive, and more than willing to help her friends in any way she currently can. After fully regaining her previous memories and unlocking all her powers, Elizabeth becomes more than willing to directly participate in battle. Elizabeth initially tended to stress out and obsess over her struggles as a Boar Hat waitress. As she was learning the ropes, Elizabeth did this so much that she failed to see most customers enjoying her company and not caring one bit about her screwing up. As her confidence grew however, Elizabeth started to notice the unconditionally satisfied customers, stopped worrying about failing, and instead started focusing on doing her best. Despite being a princess, Elizabeth is not so graceful, usually comically falling down during her duties as a waitress, still retaining some of her antics even after her memory recovery. Elizabeth also has a timid and shy side, which is shown whenever her voice starts to tremble. According to Diane, Elizabeth is very apologetic, saying sorry to her friends on more than one occasion and sometimes acting stressed out whenever she apologizes. She also is fairly gullible and honest, always being tricked by Meliodas' antics and responding rather innocent or literal to jokes in general. She also displays naivety when she wanders in theBandits' Hideoutthinking that the bandits can help her obtain ingredients without even knowing their true colors.[8]Elizabeth is often harassed by Meliodas but doesn't mind it after hearing his poor excuses, eventually growing more casual with his perverted antics and blushing less. She immediately becoming bashful when someone likeGowthertalks about her romantic feelings for Meliodas though, which is possibly feeling a hidden key to her past lives as his deceased lovers. When Meliodas came back from death, she allows him to grope her as much as he wants, showing how much she missed him and how she got used to him. Elizabeth can react in different ways around people depending on how they behave. For example, she can feel nervous or uncomfortable around anyone stressing out, acting undignified, or invading her own personal space. An example of this is shown when King gets too close to Elizabeth while apologizing for not having manners in front of a princess. Elizabeth also gets easily scared, intimidated, or stressed out by anyone expressing anger towards her or let alone using a mad tone of voice with her around. After recovering the memories of her past lives, Elizabeth's personality became a mixture between the original Goddess and the princess of Liones. She is much more mature and determined. Her feelings for her loved ones are maintained, especially her love for Meliodas, wishing above all things to prevent him from becoming the Demon King even if this means that her curse will kill her again. The wishes of her original incarnation to avoid conflicts and achieve peace with the Demon Clan are shown in how she seeks to negotiate with the demon army instead of fighting it and even protecting one of the Ten Commandments. As a child, Elizabeth was a bit rebellious, often doing dangerous things to get her father's attention since she was not his biological daughter. She eventually grew curious about the mentions of other Elizabeths that were linked to Meliodas and confronted him, but was lied to the point of crying in anger. After eventually finding out the truth fromZeldris, Elizabeth was happy and relieved, even after remembering the curse. She also retains strong attachments to her current life's friends and family, keeping her feelings towards Meliodas as strong as ever."
Who is Elizabeth's daughter?,the Supreme Deity,Abilities and equipment,"Due to being the current reincarnation of the Supreme Deity's extremely powerful daughter, Elizabeth possesses immense powers based on light, rapidly heal everyone in the Kingdom of Liones and unintentionally causing plant life to instantly grow throughout the entire Kingdom when first awakened. Even before awakening her memories, she was capable of healing several almost dying individuals or dispelling a curse placed on Merlin by Zeldris with the Demon King's magic, while her aura was capable of harming demonic creatures likeHendricksonor even a Commandment likeDerieri. Upon the return of her memories, Elizabeth's magic power increases dramatically as Elaine remarks that the ""incredible"" amount of magic the former possesses marks her as a true goddess. During the alliance of Stigma and the Seven Deadly Sins, the blade of light she generates for theLight of Pact, was of equal length but wider than the one summoned by Ludociel, leader of the Four Archangels. Her power was enough to extract the miasma out of the Commandment Melascula easily which was vital to defeat her, stop dozens of demons from battling, as well as counterHellblazetechniques."
What happened to Elizabeth after Meliodas accepted Arthur's offer to become a Great Holy Knight in the Kingdom of Camelot?,"Elizabeth was immediately distressed and heartbroken, realizing that Meliodas may leave her in the future",Seven deadly sins,"Elizabeth appears to show great respect and trust towards Meliodas, calling him with the honorific, ""Lord"", and also cares greatly about him and worries about his health and injuries continuously.[17]Throughout her journey to find the Seven Deadly Sins, Meliodas acts as a mentor and a role model for Elizabeth, often cheering her up whenever she felt powerless or doubted herself, though she doesn't care about him harassing her, such as being groped, to an extent.[18]Elizabeth has resolved to believe in Meliodas, no matter how he thinks of her or what others say bad stuff about him. Since Vaizel, Elizabeth started to blush whether Meliodas said something caring about her, hinting she might be growing feelings for him. It was pointed out by Gowther that Elizabeth has fallen in love with Meliodas, to her embarrassment. After Meliodas accepted Arthur's offer to become aGreat Holy Knightin theKingdom of Camelot, Elizabeth was immediately distressed and heartbroken, realizing that Meliodas may leave her in the future. Elizabeth revealed to Diane that she does love Meliodas since the day they first met. However, Elizabeth has a hard time telling him how she feels, as she knows that Meliodas is possibly still in love with Liz. Despite Meliodas' recent distant nature towards her, Elizabeth grew upset, but still understand he is doing this to protect her, but didn't change her mind to be by Meliodas' side and to help him and the others. This, however, change as Meliodas started to be more accepting of Elizabeth once more after she helped him over his trial to regain his strength and soon returned to groping her. Elizabeth was soon devasted over the death of Meliodas, but continued to run the bar to honor his death. Elizabeth kept Meliodas unconscious body in their bed to care for him, even healing his wounds and restoring his arm. It was soon revealed that Elizabeth survived the destruction of Danafor due to Meliodas and was promoted to a Holy Knight of Liones to watch over her. During her time growing up she was very attached to Meliodas, possibly had a crush on him as toddler, missing him when he went on missions and kissing him on the cheeks. This improved their relationship and Elizabeth is extremely grateful to Meliodas for saving her. She showed no concern or fear when Meliodas expresses his desire to not go back to being the one he used to be and does not hesitate to comfort Meliodas, saying that she will always be with him. However, when Diane revealed the existence of a goddess who looked just like her, Elizabeth starts questioning Meliodas about it, suspecting that he cared for her so much because she looked like her. Elizabeth was uncomfortable when asking Meliodas on it and Meliodas himself clearly fears the answer, even lying to her, much to her disappointment. However, Zeldris quickly reveals this when they met and Elizabeth learns that Meliodas does love her, but she is causing him to suffer too. Elizabeth desperately tries to remember, and when Zeldris restores her previous memories, as well as her goddess powers that are fully restored. However, her curse is once again activated as a result, which leads to Meliodas becoming more determined than ever to break their curses, leading to the loss of his emotions towards her and his friends. This along with his decision to become the next Demon King to break their curses, has put a serious strain on their relationship. Yet despite all of this, Elizabeth still loves Meliodas deeply, and is greatly determined to do whatever is necessary to stop him from doing all of this, even if it means falling victim to her own curse in the process of saving him. After finding out Meliodas' and her history she still choose to love him but repeatedly tries to convince him not to become the Demon King just to save her. She again and again tries to protect Meliodas and eventually after defeating the Demon King and Cath she marries Meliodas and has their child Tristan. Initially, Diane rather disliked Elizabeth despite the princess showing a great deal of respect for her, and addressing her with the honorific, ""Lady"".[19]When they first met, Elizabeth felt intimidated by Diane's size and got scared of her whenever she would express suspicion or anger towards her. Elizabeth has once said that she envies Diane's abilities to fight, and tries to support her when the Deadly Sin battles Friesia. After she selflessly attempts to save a child even though she knew it could cost her life, Diane appears to start acknowledging her, resulting in them becoming closer companions, even stating that she doesn't mind fighting for her. The two become friends and trust each other with their feelings, shown when Diane expresses her regret towards King and when Elizabeth confides in her feelings for Meliodas, although Elizabeth can still get scared of Diane whenever she gets angry.[20]After learning of her and Meliodas' curses, Diane's loyalty and protectiveness of Elizabeth as her friend only grew. Elizabeth and Ban seem to share a good relationship. Ban shows some form of care for her, when he took Veronica hostage to free Meliodas and Elizabeth, and taking her away from the rage Diane fighting against Helbram, possible due to Meliodas caring for her. However, Elizabeth and Ban don't talk to each other very often as Elizabeth tends to feel intimidated by him. Despite all of this, Ban did show genuine concern and shock for both her and Meliodas after finding out about their curses and past, and was even impressed with Elizabeth's newfound powers and her ability to heal him from Melascula's poisonous acid, when his own immortal healing abilities were barely working against it. Elizabeth and King share a good friendship, with King respecting her for being a princess and her bravery for trying to fight Guila. King worries about her well-being, and Elizabeth responding by calling him with the honorifics of ""Lord"". After learning of her and Meliodas' curses, just like Diane, King's protectiveness of her grew. Elizabeth and Gowther share a good friendship, though she was upset when Gowther erased Guila and Diane's memories. After Gowther's memories and emotions returned, she was happy for Gowther, and in turn Gowther's friendliness towards her became more genuine, as well as his desire to help and protect her. After learning of her and Meliodas' past and curses, Gowther has become determined to help the two of them in any way he can. Elizabeth and Merlin have a fairly good relationship, due to Merlin saving Elizabeth's father's life and the princess shows respect towards the mage like towards any other member of the Deadly Sins. After Meliodas revealed his past and the secret of his and Elizabeth's curse, as well as Elizabeth regaining the memories of her previous incarnations, Merlin's relationship with Elizabeth has visibly become only stronger. Merlin now shows the same level of care and concern for her as she had for the original Elizabeth. During the aftermath of the fight with Melascula, the two exchanged warm pleasantries with one another, and Merlin even referred to her as ""Big Sis Sis"", as she used to do with the original goddess Elizabeth, with Elizabeth also now showing Merlin the same big sister-like care and friendliness that her original incarnation did. Escanor is the last of the sins to have met Elizabeth, meeting her shortly during the Great Fighting Festival in Vaizel, then being properly introduced to her after Meliodas' revival and the complete reunion of all seven Sins. Since then, the two have become quick friends with one another, with their friendship and trust in one another being surprisingly strong. Even after the revelation of her and Meliodas' past, the activation of both of their curses, and even after watching him fight to suppress Meliodas' Assault Mode, the two seem to be on good terms with one another, enough that Escanor is willing to fight to save her and Meliodas both from their respective curses."
What is Elizabeth's relationship with Ludociel?,tense,Goddess clan,"At first, Elizabeth is hostile towards Estarossa for attacking Derieri and supposedly supporting Meliodas to become the Demon King. However, by remembering his lonely past as well as seeing his painful feelings for her and Meliodas, Elizabeth shows some compassion for him, even asking for help to stop Meliodas. After discovering the truth that Estarossa is Mael, Elizabeth is very sad for what the latter suffers, praying for a way to save his heart from the darkness. When Mael manages to get rid of the influence of the Commandments and returns to who he was before, Elizabeth is extremely happy. Elizabeth has a tense relationship with Ludociel, due to the ideological conflict of the Archangel with her original incarnation. However, both manage to make peace at the end of the Holy War. Elizabeth has a good relationship of trust with Sariel and Tarmiel, due to the proximity of the Archangels with her original incarnation. Elizabeth has a good relationship of trust with Sariel and Tarmiel, due to the proximity of the Archangels with her original incarnation. Zaneri initially saw Elizabeth as a nuisance who ""held everyone back"" and was somewhat jealous of her being in love with Meliodas and didn't want competition. Despite Zaneri's rather rude treatment of Elizabeth, she appreciated her help with training and the new clothes even without ever knowing that she sabotaged her trial."

After her departure, she formed two rock-like golems to accompany her, despite either of them being unable to talk. She was always alone playing with them as there were no other living beings who would accept her. At one time, however; Diane found an injured King lying unconscious on a riverbank and nursed the fairy back to health. King, who had taken a hard blow to his head, had lost all memories of his past and in his gratitude spent the next five hundred years playing with and protecting Diane. Diane later met an old man, a human, who offered Diane and King some food despite them beingFairyand a Giant. King was wary with the old man and told Diane to be careful around humans. Due to unknown reasons, Diane ended up getting a fever, in which King panicked due to Fairies never having fevers and went out to get herbs. However, Diane stopped him, telling him to not ever leave her side since she didn't want to be alone anymore. The old man who gave them food found them, and concocted a herbal medicine for Diane's fever, eventually curing her of her ailment.

Diane thus chose to use King's promise to make him always love her. He agreed wholeheartedly. Later that night, King ended up remembering who he is through various flashbacks in his dreams and found out that the village close by was on fire. King told Diane to stay back as he went to the town, promising to come back.

Diane left the village once more alone and soon entered into a petty argument with a group of knights called theKnights of the Golden Wheats, who had discriminated against her for being a giant. Meliodas stopped them, then questioned Diane if she was frightened; his having treated her as he would, a normal girl of his size made her feel as though she was his size, i.e., small.[8]Diane's encounter with Meliodas has her run straight home to tell Dolores that there was another place they could be accepted. When Diane arrived at the village, Dolores was revealed to have been killed by mountain bandits on a bodyguard job. After Diane learned that Matrona was the one who sent Dolores, she punched her in anger, upset knowing her friend would rather die, than wanting to fight.

Matrona, who trained her all her life, said that Diane had the potential to become the strongest warrior of the entire Giant Clan. Being a giant, Diane is able to perform staggering feats of strength, able to clash with the likes of Meliodas in terms of strength and even break through barriers capable of withstanding meteors with a single punch. She can swing a hammer with a weight of 998 kg . Due to her giant size, this speed is reduced to nil, but when shrunken to human size her speed increases and is able to dodge rapid arrows shot by a foe of similar ability such as Gowther. Diane has great endurance as she is able to withstand several mortal blows, such as being pierced through the shoulder and thigh and still move fast enough to save citizens from collapsing buildings, and still retain consciousness even after losing blood and taking a further beating. After passing the trial, her connection to the earth increased to where she can increase her power farther while dancing.[14]According toMelascula, her strength became comparable toDrole's.

Despite Matrona being Diane's legal guardian, Diane disliked Matrona's warrior life and her lack of empathy. Diane and Dolores wanted to have a peaceful life and not fight in battles, but Matrona refused to accept this. Despite her dislike for Matrona, Diane greatly respected her for her bravery and loyalty to her Giant Clan and greatly mourned Matrona's supposed death. Diane respected her enough to use her name as her alias during the Vaizel Fighting Festival.

During the Great fighting festival arc, Diane was visibly shocked by Drole's abilities and combat skills, as they both outmatched and canceled out her own. After being confronted by him and the former fairy king, Gloxinia in the forest, Diane was more than prepared to fight them alongside King, which impressed Drole. When they revealed their intention to betray their comrades, and then later when the two ancient kings send her and King to the past as part of their trial, Diane learned much about Drole, the holy war, and the events that lead to them joining the Ten Commandments. After passing the trial and regaining her memories, Diane began to view Drole as an ally and even seemed to have a newfound respect for him. Drole, in turn, showed even greater respect towards Diane for how she passed her trial, believing that eventually, she could be the next ruler of the Giant Clan. During his final fight with Chandler, he helped her escape, and told Diane how kind she is, and how that kindness would make her a better ruler of the Giant Clan than he ever was, stating that he would gladly become the shield for the future ""Giant Queen""."

Who saved King and his teammates?,Gowther,31 years ago,"King and his teammates participated in a mission to wipe out a group of vampires at the castle of Edinburgh. During the attack, King was partnered with Diane and confronted the two Vampires,ModandGanne, however, due to Ban, who was very drunk, and had deliberately used Snatch to steal all his and Diane's strength as they were fighting, they were both struggling very hard to defeat them. Fortunately, they were saved byGowtherwho had made the vampires believe he was a part of their family and had the two vampires attack and kill one another. Diane and King were then upset over Gowther for not coming sooner, who justified his actions by saying that he wanted to make it exciting. Sometime later, after the training, King accompanied Ban to a bar where he angrily glared at the immortal who passed out drinking while Meliodas was talking toHendricksonandDreyfus. At some point in time, he and his fellow Sins met up with King Liones who was with youngElizabeth. King did not recognize her until Gowther revealed her identity ten years later."
"What is the name of the Fairy King that Meliodas and Ban commented that his strength grew to ""an incredible level""?",King,Abilities and equipment,"As a member of the Seven Deadly Sins and the current and most powerful Fairy King in all of history, King is extremely powerful. He is strong enough to overpower a Great Holy Knight single-handedly. Being a Fairy, King has demonstrated a number of abilities unique to his species; such as the ability to levitate or fly, the ability to change his appearance and clothes at will, as well as possessing great speed equal to Meliodas and Ban. Upon unleashing his true power, Meliodas and Ban commented that his strength grew to ""an incredible level"". This was later re-affirmed when he defeated Helbram, a Great Holy Knight level combatant while protecting all the injured in the area; then almost immediately after, swiftly defeated Dreyfus, one of the Great Holy Knights of Liones, despite the injuries he sustained from his battle with Helbram. During his reign as the Fairy King, his power was said to be so great that it kept the human kingdom from invading the Fairy King's Forest. It should be noted that this included the Holy Knights of Liones. Despite his great power, King is physically weak, however, he makes up for his lack of strength with his sacred treasure, Spirit Spear Chastiefol, and his immense level of magic power. In spite of his lack of physical strength, he has shown a remarkable level of durability as shown in his second battle with Helbram. King is extremely fast, as shown when he not only effortlessly evaded the attacks of both Guila and Jericho simultaneously but also knocked them unconscious before either of them could realize it. He is also able to keep up with fellow Sins Meliodas and Ban in terms of speed. It was believed that King was able to control the Sacred Tree a long time ago and with it draw out the true power of a fairy, but the tree abandoned King for an unknown reason. This was later proven to be false as the Sacred Tree has no evil intentions at all and it was King who did not want to fully utilize the Sacred Tree's powers. After going through the trial and his wings finally growing, King's power increased greatly, being able to freely access the true power of the Sacred Tree and his Sacred Treasure.[15]Melascula states that his power became comparable to Gloxinia's.[16]Gloxinia himself remarked that despite King's wings have only barely grown, he can wield his spirit spear on par with himself and thus would be capable of surpassing the first Fairy King and even becoming the most powerful Fairy King in all of history.[17]This statement was later proven to be true, as after breaking Mael's seal and having his wings fully grown, his true potential was awakened, not only changing his appearance but the strength and quality of his powers greatly. This allowed him to not only overpower Mael with his Chastiefol but also to also use multiple Chastiefol forms simultaneously; for both offensive and defensive purposes, as he easily overwhelmed Mael in their fight while simultaneously protecting and defending Diane and everyone else from further harm during the battle.[18]"
"What was Chastiefol's power level after releasing his true form? (A) Between 11,000and12,000. (B) Between 11,000and12,000. (C) Between 11,000and12,000.",(A),Power level,"Upon releasing Chastiefol's true form, his Power Level momentarily doubled that of an Albion's. Therefore it was between11,000and12,000. After passing the trial and his wings grew slightly, his power levels were as follows:"
What does King want Meliodas to teach him to be bolder?,the Ten Commandments,Relationships,"King and Meliodas are both members of the Seven Deadly Sins. King enjoyed his time with Meliodas in the past and still cares about him to this day. When King joins up with the group, he occasionally disagrees with Meliodas' actions, but still trusts him as a good captain. After Vaizel, King struggles with the fact that Meliodas could be a demon himself. Despite finding Meliodas' perverted antics shameful, King still respects Meliodas for that shameful nature since King is too shy to be bold for Diane and wants Meliodas to teach him to be bolder. However, after finding Meliodas relates to the Ten Commandments, King starts to question Meliodas' true nature and whether or not he is on their side. It doesn't help when Meliodas refuses to tell him and instead questions his title as king of the Fairies. King decided to be on Meliodas' side since Diane and Ban trust him, but warn Meliodas that if he betrays them, King will kill him. Despite having mixed feelings over Meliodas' true nature, he was troubled to see Meliodas get beaten by the Ten Commandments and shed tears when he died, showing that deep down, King still cared about Meliodas as a captain and friend. After passing his trial, and learning about Meliodas and Elizabeth's curse, King finally understood his captain better and deeply regretted how he treated Meliodas prior to learning about his past, and as a result, his mixed feelings towards Meliodas have subsided, now fully trusting him as a close friend once again. King and Diane are both members of the Seven Deadly Sins. King is in love with Diane but is too shy to reveal it. When King is forced to do something he dislikes, he can easily be motivated if it will make Diane happy. King is shown to comfort Diane whenever she is hurt or upset. When Diane was ruthlessly beaten and near death, King was willing to use all of his powers to protect her. In the past, King looked after the young Diane for five hundred years after she saved and took care of him until he was fully healed. When they meet up again ten years later, he still loves her and finds her just as adorable as she was a decade ago. Soon after defeating Helbram, Diane regains her memories and falls in love with King. King is dedicated to protecting and loving Diane. They eventually kiss and become a couple. Even after losing her memories once again due to the actions of Gowther, Diane grew fond of King quickly when she saw how determined he was to protect her during their battle at the Great Fighting Festival, seeing him not only as her friend and ally but as someone very close to her. After the two of them underwent their trials from Drole and Gloxinia, Diane's memories were completely restored, as she immediately kissed King after explaining that her memories were back, signifying that her love for him has grown. King and Ban are both members of the Seven Deadly Sins. He hated Ban and wanted to kill him, in order to avenge his sister Elaine who was believed to be killed by Ban - even though she actually died because of a Demon's purgatory fire. When Elaine told him to protect Ban and join up with the group, King reluctantly accepts her request and assists the fight against Guila. Although he no longer despises Ban as much, he still feels uncomfortable around him. As time progresses, two become closer than they were before, as King eventually learns the whole story between him and his sister, how they loved each other, and was even shocked by how determined Ban was to bring Elaine back to life. He accompanied Ban on his journey to restore the Fairy King's Forest, and was even shocked when Ban actually accomplished this goal. He was even more shocked by Elaine's return and Ban and Elaine's love for one another, and as a result, King now truly respects and has befriended Ban. King and Gowther are both members of the Seven Deadly Sins. King is shown to be annoyed at Gowther's clueless nature and Gowther's revealing of secrets. King grew furious at Gowther for erasing Diane's memories, but at the same time, knew he was no better. However, their relationship was strained due to Gowther's actions. After passing his trial, and learning more about the holy war and Gowther's past involvement in it, he finally understood Gowther's behavior better, and despite not fully forgiving him for erasing Diane's memories, he was more than willing to assist Diane in helping Gowther deal with the return of his memories and emotions. King and Merlin are both members of the Seven Deadly Sins. Like the others, King respects Merlin greatly and is fully aware of her abilities. He has no hesitation to consult her when needed as seen when he resorted to her for a solution to Diane's amnesia. King and Escanor are both members of the Seven Deadly Sins. Not much has been revealed between the two, but it appears that King is somewhat weary of Escanor, as he goes berserk during the daytime. Elaine is King's sister, who he left at the Fairy King's Forest for 700 years, protecting the Fountain of Youth. King loved his sister so much that he was upset at the discovery of her death, vowing to avenge her by killing Ban, who was reported to be the one who killed her. Despite wanting Ban dead, he respected and accepted Elaine's request to help and protect Ban during the fight against Guila. After learning the truth behind Elaine's death, his hatred of Ban slowly disappeared, especially after learning of his intent to revive her, as well as his promise to restore the Fairy King's Forest for her. After learning of Elaine's revival, the siblings met once again at Vaizel during the Great Fighting Festival and were happy to be reunited with each other once again. King is Oslo's master and is very loyal to him. Oslo knew King many years before he met the Seven Deadly Sins, in the Fairy Realm. King cared for Oslo so much that Oslo was also a part of the reason why King was able to fully grow out his wings. Oslo's loyalty is also shown when he sacrificed himself. King and Elizabeth share fairly good friendships. King greatly respects her for being a princess of the royal family and her bravery for trying to pull his spear to help the Sins. He is concerned for her well-being, as shown when he assists Meliodas in saving her from the Ceramic Tear Inn after she was captured by Griamore. When they were properly introduced, King was shocked to find out her identity and apologized for his 'rudeness' earlier before transforming into his human form, wearing royal attire to greet Elizabeth formally, believing that it was more respectful. King and Hawk seem to share a good friendship, and sometimes King calls him Mr. Pig, Little Porker, or Little Piggy. King showed some respect for Hawk for trying to pull his spear to help Elizabeth help the Sins, but he shows more respect towards Elizabeth. Several years ago, King and Helbram were best friends, despite having different views on humans. Helbram trusted King very much, but frequently teased him. Gowther mentions that Helbram is the reason he was unable to use his full power. When King believed he killed Helbram, he decided to atone for his sins and was sentenced to imprisonment for one thousand years. As the Original Fairy King, and as a member of the Ten Commandments, King saw Gloxinia as a powerful enemy. King was visibly surprised by the difference in power between himself and the former Fairy King. This was seen during the Great Fighting Festival arc when he saw the extent of Gloxinia's healing abilities on Escanor, his abilities to form flower and wood golems for battle, as well as the different forms and abilities of his Spirit Spear Basquias. Later when Gloxinia and Drole approached King and Diane in battle, King managed to impress Gloxinia with his readiness to battle him, however, he shrugged off most of King's attacks towards him, stating that King could be stronger than he currently is if he had his wings, a statement which upset King. During his trial, King could feel the significant difference in power between his own body and Gloxinia, and also learned a lot about Gloxinia's past and the similarities between the two of them. After King passed his trial and his wings grew, both King and Gloxinia's opinions towards one another changed, due to their similar pasts. King now viewed Gloxinia as an ally and even trusted him enough to look after the Fairy King's Forest while he continued his fight with the remaining members of the Ten Commandments. Gloxinia also now seems to hold King in high regards, as he came to his rescue during the fight against Chandler, and his final words to King were how even though his wings had just grown, his power has now become comparable to his own, that eventually as they grow he would slowly, but definitely become the most powerful Fairy King of all times, a statement that King was visibly surprised by. Mertyl is Diane and King's oldest child and their adoptive child. Nasiens is Diane and King's first born child. Sixtus is Diane and King's second born child. Belte is Diane and King's third born child. Zana is Diane and King's fourth born child. Zilian is Diane and King's fifth born child. Phao is Diane and King's sixth born child. Tioreh is Diane and King's seventh born child."

What is the name of Akame's sister?,Hinata,Personality,"Akame appears to be a very serious and cold-hearted person which stems from her hellish training that the Empire forced her and her sister through, but it is eventually revealed that she is just socially awkward. She cares about her comrades very much and she is always worried that one of them may not make it out alive due to her first-hand experience that war always has a high mortality rate. AfterTatsumifoughtOgre, she stripped him of his clothes to check his body for wounds and Akame rushes to Mt. Kageboshi to aidHinatawho was about to be killed byYomihime. She also tends to hide her emotions when it is revealed that a comrade dies, such as seen withSheele, making Tatsumi mistakenly and incorrectly assume that she deals with it easily, because she is used to it. However, this prompts her to break into tears saying that she can never be fine when she loses a friend, for it is the most horrible thing of which anyone can experience. She is then comforted by Tatsumi who resolves to not die and never let her experience such pain again, making her smile. Upon facing her enemies, however, she shows absolutely no mercy towards them shouting words such as ""eliminate"" and ""consign"" to show the lack of mercy she has and also to strengthen her resolve to kill them. After donning Murasame's curse, she barely said such words. Akame loves to eat and is surprisingly known to be a big eater , much like her sisterKurome.

This turns him into a colossal Danger Beast, with the only hint of his previous self near the Danger Beast's chest. The Night Raid members deem this point to be the weak point of the Danger Beast. Akame requests Tatsumi to carry her to the chest of the Dr. Stylish Danger Beast. They successfully evade all of his attacks with the help of Susanoo and the others, so that Akame can cut him down. Dr. Stylish is killed by the poison from Akame's Teigu. Akame and the others are forced to flee from their base for fear of being found out. They temporarily take residence in an unexplored region of the Empire where they train by subjugating Danger Beasts. They relocate to a new base which is similar to the old one. They receive word that a new type of Danger Beast has been terrorizing the citizens of the Empire. Night Raid accepts this request and set off to destroy them. Najenda informs the group of the Revolutionary Army's plan to use multiple uprisings to send the Empire into chaos. One of these uprisings is to come from the followers of thePath of Peace. However, it is under threat from an Empire spy namedBolic. It is Night Raid's task to assassinate Bolic and ensure that the plans of the Revolutionary Army are kept intact. Night Raid sends false messages that Akame and Mine have left for one Kyoroch and the conflicting reports that Najenda is headed south. Night Raid successfully manages to split the Jaegers into two groups. She is later seen in her bikini with the other members of Night Raid to provide bait for their trap. Mine assures her that if they do end up fighting Kurome that she will watch Akame's back. Three month's after Bolic's assassination, Night Raid received a flood of requests from citizens as well as the Revolutionary Army to killWild Hunt. During the same night Jaeger members Run & Kurome head to Wild Hunt's headquarters to lure outChamp, Akame assassinates Wild Hunt'sEnshin. On the day of Tatsumi's execution, Night Raid arrives on the scene to rescue him. Pairing up with Mine, they take on Esdeath while Leone & Tatsumi tackleBudoand over the course of the battle, turns her attention to Budo once Esdeath is ejected. Kurome meets Akame on the outskirts of the capital at Gyou Forest. They briefly talk about the past before engaging in combat. The two sister engage in battle and thanks to a very powerful Drug, Kurome is able to land a couple of blows on Akame. Due to being tricked, Kurome then summons her puppets which includeRun,Doya, and Natala only for them to be disabled with ease by Akame. Just as Akame spots an opening and goes in for the kill suddenly Run moves in to protect her from the blow. With the defeat of her puppets, Kurome regains her strength and resolves to fight using her own skills. As the battle continues, Kurome becomes slower due to the Drugs wearing off andYatsufusataking its toll. Kurome attempts to ingest more Drugs just to beat Akame only to be stopped byWave. He speaks about protecting Kurome and declares his love for her which causes her to be conflicted and so she still tries fighting until Wave snatches her weapon and shatters it stating that she needs closure. After being kissed by Wave, Kurome tearfully asks for him to take her away. Wave announces their defection from the Empire and the sisters make up with Akame telling Kurome to live a happy life. She also takes Yatsufusa's shard as evidence to fake Kurome's death to Revolutionary Army while only a few such as Tatsumi, Wave, Najenda, and Akame know the truth. The night before Night Raid's final mission, she remembered the group's former members and swore to kill her last targets. She also stated that she would like to go on a boat trip with the remaining members of Night Raid after the revolution. Najenda later told her the names of her last targets. Akame was also given a Drug that enhanced her strength to increase her chances of completing her mission, which she has to administer before her battle with Esdeath. Akame and Leone than infiltrated the Imperial Palace and killedYoukan, their first target. She then confronted her next two targets,KoukeiandDousen, in the palace courtyard. While the targets ran away, a Teigu user appeared to stop them. Akame ordered Leone to pursue the targets while she faced the Teigu user. He activated several lethal traps with his Teigu, such as projectiles and poisonous gas, but was soon eliminated by Akame. Leone reunited with her after killing the targets and both were shocked after seeingShikoutazer. She separated from Leone and went afterSaikyuu, who was hiding in the basement. She swiftly killed him and his bodyguards before they could escape. She took his Teigu,Rongo Rongo, with her as well.Suzukaconfronted her and attempted to kill her by destroying the entire basement. Akame survived the basements destruction and stopped Esdeath from attack Tatsumi. Esdeath noted that Akame's strength had increased by some kind of performance enhancer. Akame told Esdeath that the Empire has fallen after Shikoutazer's destruction. However, Esdeath claimes she didn't really care about the Empire and their battle continued. Ten Teigu users and over one hundred thousand soldiers under the command of Najenda came to aid her in her battle with Esdeath. However, Esdeath used her new trump card, Ice Storm Commander In Chief, to freeze a large part of the Empire and started killing the opposing soldiers and Teigu users. When Tatsumi appeared, now completely transformed into a dragon, Akame pleaded with him to fall back and leave the rest to her. Akame started to circle Esdeath and managed to cut her arm while she is distracted. Esdeath manages to survive the curse by freezing time and amputating of her own arm. She also wounds Tatsumi, who pleads with Akame to kill him before his consciousness fades away completely. Akame proceeds to stab Tatsumi and activates Murasame's Trump Card. She again confronts Esdeath and fights her on equal terms thanks to the power of her Trump Card, even cutting off a few of the general's fingers. Esdeath, who is enjoying the battle, creates a wall that separates both her and Akame from the Revolutionary Army. Realizing that she can't use her Trump Card for much longer, Akame musters her strength together for a final assault. However, Esdeath encases herself in a giant soldier made of ice. Akame evades Esdeath's attacks and tries to smash through the ice. However, Esdeath reads her moves and catches Murasame between her hands. She then freezes and subsequently shatters its blade. Akame pushes every last ounce of her strength into her final attack and grabs Esdeath's own sword. She then strikes Murasame's handle and stabs Esdeath with its broken blade. Murasame's Trump Card deactivates and Akame sees Tatsumi flying towards them. Akame explains to Esdeath that she lost because she is alone and Tatsumi survived because there are people waiting for his return. She watches as a dying Esdeath encases herself in ice and shatters. Her mission now complete, she meets up with Tatsumi and Najenda. She explains that when she stabbed Tatsumi, she targeted Tyrant's life force instead of Tatsumi's and thus only Tyrant died. Akame than remembered Tatsumi promise her that he wouldn't die and was glad that she could help him keep that promise. Even though Murasame's Trump Card had ended, faded red scars remained all over Akame's body and caused it to hurt. She eventually found Leone and noticed that she was hurt as well. Akame wanted to call for a doctor but was stopped by Leone, who told Akame that she was fine and explained that she was only alive because she fused with her Teigu. Akame tried to persuade Leone to seek help, but Leone declined again because she wanted to choose how and where she died. Leone told Akame that she was her best friend and said goodbye. Akame is present along with Najenda when Tatsumi and Mine reunite and the latter wakes up from her coma. She tells Najenda that she believes in love and that memories play a significant part in Mine's recovery. When Najenda said she couldn't believe Mine was pregnant with Tatsumi's child, Akame told her that when she went to get a drink of water in the middle of the night, she witnessed Mine trying to make Tatsumi forget about Esdeath. Akame later comforted Kurome when they were lying in bed. Akame told her that she had saved many lives by allowing Wave to go to the capital during the final battle. Akame then hugged her when she was plagued by hallucinations of the people she killed. Akame also occasionally visited Kurome and Wave afterward. Najenda later met up with Akame, who informed her that she was mostly used to the pain from Murasame's curse and was ready to go to work once again. Akame then declared to keep working until the chaos and disorder in the new Empire were eradicated. After she had completed her assignments, Akame left the new Empire by boat with Rongo Rongo to hide the fact that the new nation had employed assassins. She sailed to the lands of the east in search of Jinwa, the island nation were Murasame's roots lay. She hoped that there would be a cure for Murasame's curse that still caused her pain. While alone on the ship, Akame thought to herself that she wouldn't want to trade the time spent with her companions for anything. She also decided that she would continue to live and find a way to grow as a person."

Hinata offers her place to stay and in exchange for rescuing her and giving her place to stay, Akame teaches Hinata swordsmanship due to their similar sword styles. Upon meeting with the Elder of the village under the recommendations of Hinata and Tobari, Akame tells them her real purpose in coming to Jinwa: that Akame is searching for a way to undo Murasame's curse on herself and to find a way to change Teigu-transformed humans back to their human form . Akame also reveals that Murasame's curse is slowly killing her. Akame was initially advised by the Elder not to participate in battle because of her serious injuries while all of theElder's Classare participating in their first war. However, she manages to fully recover and heads to Mt. Kageboshi where she arrives in time to assist Hinata, who was about to be killed byYomihime. Dueling Yomihime, the Elder's Class students except for Hisame witness the duel, realizing that Akame and Yomihime are in a higher league.

Her action of defeating many Tenrou ninjas earn Maruge's commendation upon her return that night. She continues her duty as usual until when Soil Spider attacks the fortress. She, along with Hinata and Hisame's unit manage to suppress hordes of Soil Spider. Immediately she discovers Tenrou spies and confirms Yomihime's participation in this battle. Just when Yomihime was about to assist Kyoukotsu after being trapped inside, Akame faced her once more.

What is the name of Akame's sister?,Teigu Murasame,Physical abilities,"Due to being raised and trained byGozukione of theFour Rakshasa Demonsand one of the Empire's most deadliest assassin for the majority of her childhood, Akame has displayed several superhuman level physical attributes such as superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, senses and durability due to the rigorous training regiment Gozuki put her through that primarily involved training and raising her within the Danger Beast infested wilderness mountains that eventually lead to her current physical build and skill level. Akame is often considered to be one of the strongest members of Night Raid, slaying even the strongest of enemies with minimal effort. Her hellish assassination training allows her combat prowess to be on par with those as powerful as the General rank within the military levels of the Empire,Esdeathherself acknowledging her strength. Akame is an extremely skilled master swordswoman, able to wield her Teigu Murasame with utmost dexterity and precision, able to slay numerous enemies, even highly skilled and powerful enemies with incredible ease. She easily slayedIzoua fellow master swordsman in combat and would have killed Tatsumi, if not for the statue his chief villager gave him before embarking on his journey. At her full strength, Akame managed to hold her own against Esdeath, a tremendously powerful master swordswoman and ultimately killed her with a single precise thrust, plunging Murasame's shattered blade directly into Esdeath's heart. Likeher sister, for some unexplained reason, Akame seems to be able to consume large amounts of food without any adverse effects on her body. No matter how much she eats, she is somehow able to metabolize all the food she ate without becoming full or even remotely fat, quite possibly due to her high metabolism. Akame possesses tremendous speed, agility and reflexes, being able to dodge and counter-attack with deadly results, and is also skilled in hand to hand combat. She also gives off no killing intent at all when she fights, making it difficult for the enemy to sense her presence. According to Wave, she can run at Mach 1 . Like the other members of the Elite Seven, she is immune to most poisons. After being affected by Murasame's curse and her feeling the after effects of the pill, her body was stated to now feel heavy and sluggish and she could no longer be able to move like she once did. This is seen where Akame could no longer move and fight in the same speed, finesse and accuracy as she once did due to her body no longer being in its prime. Despite the fact that she was afflicted by the curse that was slowly eating away her body and feeling the after effects of the doping pill, Akame has shown that she could still keep up with Hinata and Tobari during training despite the girl's own immense physical prowess and later Akame even showcased that even in her weakened state, she could still fight on equal ground againstYomihimeof the Tenrou Nation's famed,Ten Starsto a stand still and force her to retreat both times in Shiranui Fortress and Mt, Kageboshi, however it was stated by her that she could not defeat her due to her body feeling to heavy to overpower her. Later she was still able to physically keep up with Hinata andSaihaunderwater to stop Waniba's men from delaying Hisame during groom selection at Soukai. She later receives 4 medicinal pills that can temporarily surpress her curse, allowing her to fight at full strength. With her current full strength using medicine, she was able to defeatMoegiwith less resistance."
How did Akame's own strength give her the power of being completely skilled in combat? Available choices: (a). None of the above choices. (b). She was trained by both Gozuki and Grand General Budo. (c). She was trained by both Gozuki and Grand General Budo. (d). She was trained by both Gozuki and Grand General Budo.,(b).,Hand-to-hand combatant,"Akame was trained by bothGozukiand Grand GeneralBudoduring her time as an Assassin within the Empire in Hand-to-Hand physical combat and later received further training underLeoneandBulatthat further reinforced her skill level. This has made Akame incredibly dangerous and lethal even withoutMurasameand has shown to easily kill several enemy combatants without the need of a weapon. Akame's own strength gives her the power of being completely skilled in combat. Her punches and kicks are extremely powerful and are enough to take down and slay numerous enemies, even highly skilled and powerful enemies with incredible ease. After eliminating the contingent of theDark Squadlead byKylieto assassinate key members of theRevolutionary Army, Akame has successfully acquired some of theDrugsprescribed to them bythe Empire. Eventually the lead Doctor of the Army successfully managed to synthesis and combined the various drugs collected into a single pill that greatly enhanced all of Akame's physical abilities to an even higher level of power to the point that she could pressure and push backEsdeath. However, it was warned by the doctor that by taking it, there was a chance of Akame later suffering immense physical damage that may permanently remove her honed senses as an assassin and destroy her physical health. The drug doping obtained fromEnjiwas different, as it can curb her curse for a set amount of time, and she only receives a very limited amount of it. When she takes a pill, the effects of Murasame's curse was nullified and Akame was able to use her full strength."

What is Tatsumi's profession in Akame Ga Kill!?,assassin,Anime,"Tatsumiis the main protagonist ofAkame Ga Kill!. A young fighter who had set out along with two childhood friends to make a name for himself and earn money for his village, Tatsumi is a kindhearted person who wants everyone to live happily but has no problem with becoming violent if his friends or his ideals are threatened. After learning of the corruption and evil ofthe Empireand discovering the deaths of his friends, Tatsumi was invited to join Night Raid, a group of assassins that are affiliated with theRevolutionary Armycurrently at war with the Empire. He eventually accepts the invitation and slowly begins to accept his new life and trade, while still grieving over the loss of his friends and beginning to learn about his new ones. He used to be the owner of theTeiguIncursiountil he was fused with it and became a dragon. He had sworn to use this opportunity to take down the Empire in its entirety. He fought against the Emperor to finally bring down the corrupt Empire that had caused people to suffer. At the end of the fight againstShikoutazer, Incursio's influence had increased drastically and Tatsumi was consumed. His body has become a dragon, but his mind remains.

What is the name of Tatsumi's teacher?,Esdeath,Appearance,"Tatsumi's Pure and Innocent Smile Tatsumi is a young man of average height with green eyes and medium length brown hair with a cowlick that falls with its weight. He used to wear a white, high collar jacket over a tan sweater vest, a pair of black pants, brown gloves and combat boots, but later changes his outfit and now has a more traditional white assassin jacket over a slim purple hoodie and a black base layer shirt with black jeans. On his back, he carries Incursio's key, a short sword with a chain-link tassel at the hilt, in its sheath. Having been trained in the way of the sword and hand-to-hand combat since he was young, Tatsumi has had a fairly lean, muscular physique. After training for one month while the Night Raid base was being relocated, he seems to have bulked up enough forEsdeathto notice and comment upon the change. Upon activating his Teigu, Tatsumi is covered in armor similar to the one of which his late teacher used to wear. Tatsumi's armor is far lighter to suit his fighting style, although the long cape has not changed. After Incursio evolved to grant Tatsumi greater power, the armor has now slimmed down to a more streamlined aerodynamic, sporting longer horns, four eyes reminiscent to Tyrant with hooked claws on its fingers and toes while finally losing the long coat and replacing it with two long, black tassels with fuzzed ends dangling off them. Due to having fused with Incursio, Tatsumi has slowly begun to take on the physical qualities of its design motif, Tyrant. After its evolution, he sported a single red eye with cross slit pupil at the center, with the cowlick having disappeared entirely. After having invoked it a second time, Tatsumi has degraded further into a more draconian form. The right side of his face now sporting a more scaly, reptilian appearance with a massive horn jutting out the top back of his head, with his right hand taking on similar features sporting tusk-like fingernails and segmented skin plates. Upon using it a third time, a pair of horns have sprouted from both sides of Tatsumi's head along with his hands gaining more reptilian features. After the final evolution from Incursio's armor, Tatsumi loses all physical traits of a human. His draconian features become more defined, scales now cover his entire body, and his mouth has formed into a dragon's, sporting sharp and jagged teeth. During this final change to his appearance, even Shikoutazer's scanning system no longer recognizes Tatsumi as a 'human'. And once Tatsumi was finally consumed by Incursio, his body changed to host Incursio's soul. Tatsumi changes into a massive dragon, becoming the size of a small building. Unlike Incursio's original body, Tatsumi's form as a dragon is smaller, possesses wings, and has more red eyes. It is no longer possible to distinguish Tatsumi from a Danger Beast."

He asks if there are Teigu that can bring the dead back to life and is deeply hurt when the other Night Raid members tell him that there is no such Teigu. Sheele notices that there is deeper reasoning to this and finds him at the graves of his friends, trying to hold back tears, stating that he had hoped that there was a Teigu able to bring the dead back. She hugs him and tells him that it is okay to cry. Sheele comforts him, holding him in her arms. He thanked her for her kindness, and from that point, the two became closer.

He then meetsSeryu, who helps him find the bar he was ordered to find, and reunites with Leone there. They enter the targeted building and witness a gang kill a drugged prostitute, a girl that Leone knew from the streets. Together, they eliminate all the gangsters in the building. When he asks Leone what will happen to the girls, she replies that it isn't their problem, but then tells him that she knows a doctor who will look after the wounded girls if she asks him to. Tatsumi notes her kindness with a smile and she ""marks him"" as hers. Tatsumi wonders how the other team are doing. Mine returns to the hideout, sharing the bad news of Sheele's demise at the hands of Seryu Ubiquitous. Tatsumi and the rest of Night Raid are devastated and enraged. Tatsumi begins to leave to get revenge on Seryu, but is stopped by Bulat, who tells him to stop acting childish and pull himself together.

The next morning, Tatsumi attempts to clean the bloodstain from his sword while thinking about how the boy only saw the Kobores brother as a good father, instead of the villain he actually was. Leone shows up and tells him that he could scrub the sword for his entire life, but the stain of blood would never fade. While she tries to cheer him up, he asks where she got her Teigu and why she fights the Empire. While he finds that her reasons give him strength, he is still troubled. Later that night as he goes to eat, he witnesses Akame preparingSheele's favorite food to offer to her grave, and Tatsumi tells her that he admires the way she can remain so unaffected, and that losing a friend is something that he will have to get used to like her. Akame grabs Tatsumi, and tearfully tells him that she will never get used to losing her friends. Tatsumi realizes that she was just as affected as he was, and swears to her that he will never put her through the pain of losing him. He begins training with Akame with a new determination, unwilling to stop until he becomes strong enough to live up to his promise with her. He is interrupted byBulat, who offers to train Tatsumi so he can become stronger, Tatsumi accepts and goes with Bulat to Mt. Fake, where he and Bulat fight against tree beasts as part of his training. The two bond as they put their lives on the line battling the danger beasts of the mountain. When the two return to the hideout, Night Raid has a meeting to discuss thePrime Minister, who has begun to order his political enemies to be killed, simultaneously using Night Raid as a scapegoat and blaming them for the assassinations. Najenda also notes that Esdeath has returned to the Capital, having finished with her campaign against theNorthern Tribes.Lastly, Najenda notes that she has lost contact with the Night Raid away team, and worries that they have been wiped out. Bulat and Tatsumi are then assigned the task of protecting another of the Prime Minister's political enemies, who is aboard the cruise ship, ""Ryuusen"". Tatsumi callingIncursiofor the first time Tatsumi and Bulat arrive at the luxury liner and board, Bulat uses Incursio's stealth ability to scout out the area for potential attackers. The Three Beasts arrive at the same time and begin to search for their target. Tatsumi learns of Bulat's past, and the reason why he fights the Empire. Bulat then must retreat to the interior of the ship as the time limit on Incursio's stealth ability had been reached. Bulat then leaves for the interior of the ship, leaving Tatsumi in charge of watching for the assassins. While he is gone, Tatsumi is weakened by the TeiguScream's music, and the crew and most of the guests are put to sleep. Tatsumi is attacked byDaidara, whose Teigu gives him a major advantage, but Tatsumi is able to hold his own until Bulat shows up. Bulat tells Tatsumi to watch his battle closely and memorize his movements, as the other members of the Three Beasts arrive. Bulat evades their attacks, leaping high into the air, knocking outNyau, and quickly uses Neuntote to cut Daidara in half, killing him instantly. He then begins to fight withLiver, his former superior from his days with the Empire. Still able to fight, Nyau attempts to play Scream to give Liver an advantage, but is stopped by Tatsumi. While Bulat fights Liver, Tatsumi keeps Nyau from interfering, but is unable to keep him occupied for the whole fight and Nyau defeats him, stopping Bulat from landing the killing blow on Liver. While Bulat ends up defeating Liver, he is poisoned and wounded. Tatsumi grabs Bulat and attempts to escape with him, but is stopped by Nyau who uses his trump card, growing to full adult size. Bulat entrusts Tatsumi with his sword, saying that it is Incursio's key and to use it. Tatsumi's will is so strong that the Teigu's core evolves to match him. With this new power, Tatsumi kills Nyau in one punch. Bulat succumbs due to his wounds and the deadly poison that Liver used in their fight. Tatsumi sobs as his friend and mentor passed away before him. He then takes the rest of the Teigu along with him back to the Night Raid hideout. Some time after this event, Mine's injuries were completely healed, and she immediately began to train in order to become stronger and avenge Sheele. She finds both Akame and Leone helping Tatsumi and Lubbock train, sitting on their backs as they do pushups. Tatsumi tells her that he is training so he can use Incursio more effectively, and to be able to use its stealth ability for a longer period of time. Lubbock adds that he and Tatsumi are now the only men left in Night Raid, so he should better start getting serious. Najenda arrives to tell everyone that she is leaving for the Revolutionary Army HQ, in order to hand over the Teigu that Tatsumi gathered. Before leaving, she places Akame in charge, and offers Tatsumi some words of comfort, telling him that he is strong. Leone tells Tatsumi that Bulat had faith in Tatsumi's abilities, and was sure that he would someday become extremely powerful, surpassing even his former mentor. Tatsumi heads to the capital hide-out, which is disguised as a bookstore owned by Lubbock. The two head down the stairway to the secret room to find an intoxicated Leone already there. Lubbock informs him that Mine's face has been put up on wanted posters, meaning that they are now the only ones left who can walk through the streets of the capital by day. Tatsumi asks about the new police group formed called the ""Jaegers"", and their leaderEsdeath. Lubbock tells him that a few years ago there was a group of savage tribes in the south-west of the Empire that rose up in rebellion. Many thought that the Empire would win due to the fact that the tribe only had 10,000 soldiers while the Emperial military sent 120,000. However, the environment proved the tribes' greatest weapon, as the outskirts of the Empire were a harsh environment, and the soldiers were born near the Capital, with no experience of such unforgiving terrain. When all seemed lost, the Empire sent General Najenda and Esdeath to reinforce the army. Esdeath froze a lake that had effectively cut off the army from the tribes' main village, and using the frozen surface as a bridge, the forces crossed over and defeated the tribe. Esdeath then took the captured leaders, and forced them to watch while she had her forces perform mass rape and murder of the tribes civilians, to discourage rebellion in the future. Tatsumi, however, was confused by this, and stated that the incident would only create future rebellion, Lubbock tells him that future rebellion is exactly what Esdeath wanted. Lubbock tells Tatsumi that the Empire is holding a tournament, in which the winner will obtain a large cash reward, and that he should enter so he can send the money back to his home village. Esdeath oversees the Tournament personally, which the Empire had staged in order to find a new user for the TeiguExtase. Tatsumi enters the Tournament under the guise of a blacksmith from the countryside, and wins the tournament, showing his great skill, fearlessness and confident smile, unknowingly fulfilling all of Esdeath's requirements and capturing her heart. Esdeath herself came down to meet Tatsumi and give him his reward. She places a collar around his neck to the shock of everyone present, and drags him off to the Jaegers' headquarters. At the Jaegers' headquarters, Esdeath informs the rest of the group that Tatsumi will be a new member and her partner in love.WaveandRunhowever question why he is chained and wearing a collar, to which she replies that it is to show people that he is her lover, Esdeath is then convinced to take the collar off, and Tatsumi tells her that he has no interest in working for the Empire. Esdeath, however, shrugs this off and tells him that she will make him obedient in time. Seryu then interrupts, telling them that it is a lot to take in, and Tatsumi feels a flash of anger, but holds his emotions in line to not blow his cover. A messenger arrives to tell Esdeath that they have located the hideout of a group of Bandits. While the rest of Jaeger attack the bandit camp, Esdeath and Tatsumi watch from a nearby cliff, Tatsumi thinks of escape, but Esdeath holds his hand, making it impossible. After the fight concludes, she tells him that he will sleep with her in her room. Tatsumi decides he will try to persuade Esdeath to side with him and the Revolutionary Army, however, this fails as she insists on servingThe Empire. Esdeath sternly retorts that it is she who will change and control him and not vice versa and uses him as a human pillow for the rest of the night, making him so nervous that he couldn't sleep. Tatsumi vs Wave In the morning, Wave notes that he must have had a rough night, and Tatsumi tells him that he was so nervous that he couldn't rest. He noticesKuromeeating her candy, and is reminded of Akame. He tells her of how she looks similar to the girl on the wanted posters. She explains that the two are sisters and vows that she will kill her. Tatsumi, Esdeath, Wave, and Kurome then head to Mt. Fake to huntDanger Beasts, and Wave and Tatsumi are paired up. While walking along a mountain path, Tatsumi silently remembers the times he spent with Bulat on this very mountain. Wave tells Tatsumi that they seem to have a lot in common, and seem to deal with the same type of comrades. The two then encounter a group of several tree beasts and begin to fight them. Using the confusion of battle, Tatsumi manages to activate Incursio and slips away. After dispatching the last of the Tree Beasts, Wave notices Tatsumi's absence, and fearfully imagines the punishment in store for him if Esdeath finds out he let Tatsumi escape. Wave activatesGrand Chariotand begins to search for Tatsumi. The two encounter each other, but are both unable to recognize the other due to their armor Teigu. Wave recognizes Incursio as a Teigu in the possession of Night Raid, and attacks. Tatsumi is unwilling to fight Wave, and instead focuses on attempting to escape. Wave taunts Tatsumi, telling him that he's heard of Night Raid, and that they are villains who murder innocent people, which Tatsumi angrily denies. Wave attacks Tatsumi, sending him flying into a river. Tatsumi uses this chance to activate Incursio's stealth ability, fooling Wave into thinking that he was floating downriver to escape, while he was actually on the river's bank. Tatsumi encounters a danger beast but is too wounded to fight back, but he is saved by Akame who tells him she waited at the cities' main gates and followed him secretly after he left, the two become close, but are interrupted by Lubbock, who notes that his death wouldn't have been so bad as he would have been the only man left. Akame, however, notifies Tatsumi that he was actually very worried. Tatsumi later reports everything he has learned about the Jaegers. He tells the rest of Night Raid that the Jaegers match them skill for skill and as such numbered them as they are. He is also very worried about Esdeath as she is very powerful, with the element of surprise with her as well as the fact that they have no idea of the limitations of her power. Akame however, reassures everyone that they will kill her. With this, the Night Raid celebrate his return. Unknown to Tatsumi, however,Dr. Stylishhad tracked him back to the Night Raid hideout. Dr. Styish uses his own personal armyTeam Stylishto attack the Night Raid Hide-Out. During this attack Tatsumi busts out and attack the infantry head on, decimating it in the process, and he notes that the soldiers he is fighting belong to Doctor Stylish and that he must be working alone, then encountersKaku. Upon seeing that he has Sheele's Teigu, Extase, he becomes deeply angered and instead of fighting Kaku he attempts to retrieve the Teigu becoming injured as a result of him doing so. Mine arrives and kills Kaku, finally bring Sheele's Teigu back to where it belongs. He is joined by an injured and furious Leone who saves Mine and kills Trooma. Najenda soon arrives and the rest of Night Raid escape from the Headquarters, but they're however, affected by a poisonous gas that renders them immobile with only Tatsumi being able to fight. Just as everyone is in trouble, Susanoo comes in to help everyone out. After Stylish injects himself with a drug that transforms him into a Danger Beast, he helps Akame to get close to Stylish on the Danger Beast's head where she kills him. He stands with the rest of Night Raid as Stylish lays dead on the ground. Tatsumi and the rest of Night Raid relocated from their base to an unexplored area of the empire filled with danger beasts to keep low from the eyes of the Jaegers. Tatsumi participates in a danger beast hunt with Leone who comments about how strong Tatsumi has become due to becoming able to summon Incursio's auxiliary spear. Upon their return to the capital they receive reports of a new kind of danger beast. Although they admit that in some way this is helping the empire, Tatsumi declares that above all they fight for the people so he would like to destroy the danger beasts as soon as possible. On a patrol with Lubbock, Tatsumi decides that it would be better to survey the area on top of a nearby mountain. Once there he is nearly attacked by Esdeath who is flying overhead, she stops her attack but the two of them are attacked by several of the new danger beasts . Esdeath makes quick work of them. Esdeath comments on how it must be fate for them to meet again. The two of them are attacked by a hooded enemy who uses his Teigu to teleport them. They arrive to an inhabited island. Tatsumi believes that they are under an illusion and asks Esdeath to hurt him to show whether it is an illusion or not. She responds by kissing him and disproves the fact that they are under an illusion. Esdeath creates an ice pillar to attain a higher vantage point to see. They are attacked by two colossal danger beast . Tatsumi kills one by using an ice pillar that Esdeath creates to jump on to the area near the weak point of the danger beast. Esdeath kills the other one by crushing it with a massive ice hammer. Esdeath determines that they are on an island southeast of the Empire. They decide that there is no use panicking and make preparations to stay on the island. By the end of the day Esdeath mentions and finds a mark in the sand related to the power that sent them here. Deducing that it must open again at some point they wait for it to open. Waiting for the mark to allow them back to the Empire, Tatsumi tells Esdeath about how he learned both his swordsmanship and blacksmithing skills from a retired soldier that lived in his village. In turn, for his story Esdeath tells Tatsumi about how she was the sole survivor of a danger beast hunting clan and how after she became bored with danger beasts she joined the army, becoming a general and consuming the ice demon's blood Teigu to give her ice manipulation powers. Tatsumi realizes that it is folly to try to recruit her to the revolutionary army due to her original sadistic ego. At this point, Esdeath reveals her intention to find a danger beast to be able to ride on. Tatsumi spots one and while Esdeath is distracted with catching the beast the portal opens again. Tatsumi enters the portal, but not before he tells Esdeath about it. On the other side he seemingly disappears using Incursio's invisibility skill. He mentions that they will meet again but as enemies. Tatsumi and the rest of Night Raid are told by Najenda that the revolutionary army will make its move in a multi-direction attack on the Empire. Night Raid receives an order to killBolic, a key member of the religious group Path of Peace due to his involvement as a spy for the empire which threatens to suppress an uprising by the Path of Peace followers, which is to become one of the attacks of the revolutionary army. Knowing that the Jaegers will continue to chase them as they head for Kyocroch, they decide to spread misinformation that they are headed in two different directions. They successfully manage to split the Jaegers into two halves with Bols, Kurome and Wave in one and Esdeath, Run and Seryu in the other. Tatsumi and all of Night Raid ambush Kurome's group. Due to a surprise attack they manage to send Wave flying from the battlefield. Kurome however, summons her eight corpse dolls to engage against Night Raid including the super high class danger beast Destaghoul. Tatsumi defeatsApeman As they engage the enemy each member of Night Raid is forced to split up to deal with the corpse dolls. Tatsumi is forced to defeat Apeman who is backed up by Hentarr, once a survivor from the Ban tribes. He decides that fighting the two of them is unfavorable and manages to split them up whilst Chelsea destroys Hentar. She leaves Tatsumi to destroy apeman and he succeeds in knocking Apeman up the rockface to the place where Kurome resides. In a flurry of devastating punches and a final blow to the head Apeman's head is crushed and Apeman is left incapacitated. Tatsumi prepares to fight Natala, but several interruptions, including interference from Susanoo, stop the fight. At this point, a self-destruct explosion occurs from Bor's Rubicante, forcing Kurome to retreat and the battle ends, but not before Chelsea kills Bols while in disguise. Tatsumi groups with the rest of Night Raid and is astounded when he learns that Leone's arm can be re-attached . He is told that Chelsea went after Kurome and he chases her to the nearest town only to find that Chelsea had been killed and her head was on top of a pole in the town. That night he dreams of the fallen Night Raid members; Sheele, Bulat and Chelsea. He expresses regret that he wasn't able to spend more time with them, but resolves himself the next day to continue his mission. Night Raid arrive in Kyocroch. They set out surveying the area as they know that it will not be easy to kill Bolic due to the Jaegers interference. They are also staked out by members of the Rakasha Demons. Whilst on a mission with Mine, Tatsumi is attacked by Seryu of the Jaegers and a member of the Rakasha Demons. They split up with Tatsumi handling the Rakasha demon and leaving Mine to handle Seryu. Tatsumi moves the fight to a nearby ruin. Unable to connect a clean hit on the Rakasha demon Tatsumi decides to bring down the entire ruin on his assailant. He leaves the rubble unharmed and his assailant is unable to continue the fight with Tatsumi. Tatsumi rushes to Mine's aid, saving her from the self-destruct bomb planted in Seryu's head should she ever be about to be killed. He declares that he was too weak to save Bulat, too late to save Chelsea, but just in time to save Mine. After several weeks of rest and preparation, Night Raid decide to assassinate Bolic. Night Raid is to split into two groups. One consisting of Akame, Mine and Lubbock and the other with Najenda, Tatsumi, Leone, and Susanoo. The former group is charged with sneaking with an air manta and striking from behind whilst the latter group is to serve as a distraction for Esdeath and the Jaegers. The distraction group find Bolic, Esdeath and Kurome in a cathedral-like area. They find that the other group have yet to come as planned. They begin to fight Esdeath whilst Tatsumi uses Incursio's ability to go invisible in order to find an opportunity to kill Bolic in the fighting. However, Esdeath quickly defeats the members of Night Raid and begins to torture Leone. Unable to handle the torture of his friends Tatsumi goes out of his invisible state and strikes at Esdeath but is quickly defeated. At this point, Najenda is forced to use Susanoo's trump card a second time in order to kill Bolic quickly. With his increased abilities he gets close to killing him, but at the last moment, Esdeath uses her trump card to freeze time and stop Susanoo, dicing him to pieces. Esdeath is curious as to who is underneath Incursio's armor attempts to remove it however, it is at this time where the other group arrives and is able to strike Bolic. Tatsumi forces himself to hold back Esdeath for a moment, which is just enough time for Akame to kill Bolic. Night Raid is forced to flee and Najenda is forced to use Susanoo's trump card a third time to hold back Esdeath. Night Raid flee with their mission complete, but at a cost of Susanoo, who dies holding back Esdeath. As the revolution begins, Night Raid takes a less direct route to their base in order to fool pursuers and to heal from injuries sustained in the previous mission. Mine and Tatsumi are sent off to collect food for Night Raid as they camp. Mine, whose feelings have grown for Tatsumi attempts to confess to him, but he misunderstands. Mine is forced to kiss him to get him to realize her feelings toward him. They agree to go out together and declare their relationship to the rest of Night Raid. Night Raid's intention to destroy Wild Hunt In the capital a new group sent to aid security in the capital;Wild Huntputs the capital in the grip of fear and terror. After, several requests from the public and in addition orders from the Revolutionary Army, Night Raid sets out exterminate them. When we next see Night Raid, they interfere in a battle between the Jaeger membersRunandKuromeand the two members of Wild Hunt;CosminaandEnshin. Tatsumi using his spear slams into the ground sending large amounts of rock at Enshin which distracts Enshin enough to catch him off guard to Akame's attack leaving him dead. As the other member of Wild Hunt Cosmina is also dead, Night Raid turn to fight Kurome and Run. However, with the last of his strength Run attacks them, whose attack is blocked by Tatsumi. The Jaegers flee the scene. Some time later, Tatsumi and Lubbock get caught in a trap by Syura who teleports them in the palace. Despite the disadvantageous situation, Tatsumi attempts to control the situation with the priority to flee. He tactically runs to an empty area, using his trump card of invisibility, he deals a damaging kick to Syura, Dorothea and Suzuka and then produces a smokescreen to avoidIzou. However, as he leaps to get away, he is stopped by Esdeath andBudoleading to their capture. Tatsumi wakes up in a prison cell, greeted by Suzuka andDorotheawho aim to make him their play thing and disgrace him. Dorothea claims that she didn't have any sexual desires until she bit him earlier. Esdeath then enters and angered by this scene, she slams Suzuka's face to the wall and threatens the two to never lay a finger on him. Tatsumi, is then embraced by Esdeath, but only to be displeased. He states that he will never join her and announces that he is in love and in a relationship already, much to her surprise. Esdeath declaring that Tatsumi will be killed by her own hands Still clutching on his resolve, Tatsumi rejects to eat food made by Esdeath and the offer to become her subordinate or risk public execution. Once he hears about Lubbock being dead, the persuasion is futile and he is willing to die rather than being a traitor to Night Raid. With the dawn of day of the execution approaching, Esdeath is unable to convince him and become hers, she then comes to the conclusion; if Tatsumi will never be hers, she will at least deliver his death instead to prevent anyone else touching him. Tatsumi's execution On the day of the execution, Tatsumi was tied to a cross with his executors, Esdeath and Budo, and questioning Budo on his view on the current Empire. Esdeath prepares to impale Tatsumi, stating her understanding of the human body, and telling Tatsumi to try and survive as long as possible . Seeing how the crowd seemed to enjoy how Tatsumi was about to be killed, Tatsumi accepted his death, but vowed that he wouldn't give them any satisfaction from it, but simply smile and laugh, to show Night Raid's pride. Before Esdeath managed to pierce Tatsumi, the execution was crashed by Mine who arrive to save Tatsumi, much to Tatsumi's horror, though he was touched by how far Mine was willing to go for him, something that Esdeath noticed. Incursio evolves After, successfully blasting Budo away from the Colosseum and holding her own against Esdeath's attacks, Tatsumi was amazed by how Mine showed that, despite the overwhelming odds, Mine showed no intention of dying, but rather getting Tatsumi out of there successfully. While fighting Esdeath, Mine used her ""Genius"" sniping skills to free Tatsumi, though grazed his sleeve a bit, which Tatsumi noted that Mine still did it too close for comfort. Going immediately for Incursio, he grasped the hilt, but pulled back in pain as he noticed some small barbed wiring around Incurio's hilt. Hearing Esdeath tells him to come at her and show her how strong he was, Tatsumi prepares to don Insursio. Remembering Lubbock's death and determined to prevent that from happening to Mine, Tatsumi speaks to Incursio as he dons the armor, demanding more power from the Teigu to destroy the injustice of the empire, leading to another evolution of the Incursio, regardless of how painful it might be for him. As Tatsumi emerges in his evolved Incursio form, he immediately charged at Esdeath to attack, and unlike before at the Cathedral, had managed to fight more evenly with her, something that Esdeath noted with joy, as they were finally connecting for the first time. Tatsumi stated that Esdeath cannot be as lax now. Incursio withstanding Mahapdma With Tatsumi's new power, coupled with Mine's support, forced Esdeath to use Mahapadma to prevent herself from being struck. However, much to her surprise, Tatsumi had managed to resist the technique thanks to Incursio having evolved to resist the cold, overcoming her Trump Card for a moment. The battle against Esdeath continues with Akame and Leone joining the fray. Soon, Budo reemerges undamaged, despite the powerful blast from Pumpkin he received, and pissed off at Night Raid for disrupting the peace of the Capital. After telling Akame and Leone about Lubbock's death, he and the others prepared to face both Budo and Esdeath. While facing them, Tatsumi noted the extreme pain he was feeling, as if his body was being ripped to shreds. However, Tatsumi moved to block Budo's lightning attacks, and noted that this was the time to push his body beyond its limits. After blocking Budo's attack, Tatsumi and Leone teamed up to fight Budo, further angering the Great General, and summoned lightning from the sky that struck them both, rendering them immobile. However, Tatsumi had quickly recovered, as Incursio had evolved to even resist lightning attacks, and began to fight Budo on his own. During their fight, Tatsumi said in his mind towards Budo that he once strove to be at the top of the ranks, and now that was what he was battling against, with his body and soul. Budo prepares to battle Night Raid Shocking Budo by how Tatsumi was able to be able to fight on par with him, as despite his potential, Tatsumi's power up seemed almost instant, leading Budo to deduce the possibility of Incursio fusing with Tatsumi. Attempting to finish him off, Budo summoned another lightning-bolt to strike Tatsumi, but this time Tatsumi saw it coming, telling Budo that he was told to always be aware of his surroundings, thinking of Bulat, who gave him that advice. Tatsumi then struck a powerful slash across Budo's back, injuring him greatly and making him collapse, before he got back up, and his lightning growing wilder due to Budo's anger. Esdeath, who had been fighting both Akame and Mine at the time, intervened and battled Tatsumi, stating to Budo that Tatsumi was meant to be executed by her. Tatsumi lands the first blow on Esdeath As Budo unleashes his technique, ""Advent of the Thunder Emperor,"" Tatsumi looks at his comrades with worry, before Esdeath attacked, reminding him that his enemy not the lightning, but the ice, and told Tatsumi to give it everything he had. Though they fought fiercely, Esdeath commented that he still had yet to truly reach her and she attempted to capture him in ice, though Tatsumi dodged, much to her surprise. As Tatsumi was stated by Esdeath to be growing stronger even while battling, Tatsumi moved into to strike Esdeath from above. Tatsumi knew that, despite Esdeath telling him to give it everything he had, she was showing so much enjoyment, something he would exploit to give him an opening. When Esdeath blocked his attack, Tatsumi let go of his weapon, and moved into to deliver a powerful punch, which was strong enough to break through her ice armor, and strike her, knocking her away, though Tatsumi was surprised that he managed to actually do it. As Najenda arrived at the scene for their escape, Budo attempted to attack her, but Tatsumi blocked it, saying that if he let Najenda get hurt, he'd never be able to face Lubo again, tipping Najenda about Lubo's fate. Tatsumi strikes Budo When asked by Akame about Esdeath, he replied that he managed to strike a blow, which will buy them enough time to escape from her stunning Akame. Telling them to get on the Danger Beast, Tatsumi allowed himself to be the shield and blocked more of Budo's attacks with his resistant armored body, though Budo knocked him away. As Budo overwhelmed Akame, Leone, and even blocked Mine's attack, due to Pumpkin being pushed too far. As Budo stated that there was no escape for them, Tatsumi got up and declared that they'd all get out of here alive. Budo noted that Tatsumi showed the same expression as ""that brat"", which Tatsumi realized was Lubo, meaning that Lubo hadn't given up to his last breath, making Tatsumi determined not to give up either. As Tatsumi and Budo prepared to attack, Mine declared that she'd use her Trump Card, a bluff meant to catch Budo off guard for a moment, which worked, and allowed Tatsumi to deliver a devastating punch to Budo, sending him flying back. Getting Akame, Tatsumi headed for the Danger Beast to escape, but he soon collapsed, as the poison that he had been given from the barbed wiring on Incursio's hilt had taken effect. While the poison was capable of killing a High Class Danger Beast instantly, Tatsumi having donned Incursio almost immediately, had managed to cut the effects to a certain extent, though even that had reached its limit from the intense fighting. Tatsumi lost his consciousness from that, where Mine soon sacrificed herself to save them and kill Budo, using all her power that rendered her comatose, and Pumpkin destroyed. Tatsumi's oath to Mine Staying by her bedside, he told her about how she had managed to help them succeed in making the revolution nearing success. He told her to rest for now and leave the fighting to him, which he'd take her share in her place. As Mine was later being taken away and cared for until she wakes up, Tatsumi held her hand and told her that when the time came, he wanted to marry her while declaring that he loved her. When Najenda asked how his body was, Tatsumi stated that he felt power welling up inside him, and recalled how he was examined by a doctor that was able to use the Perfector Teigu, and learned that Incursio had bonded with him, and thus he was becoming Incurio's dragon armor, though warned that this was not a power-up at all, but rather it would break him, though unlike a poison, Tatsumi was gradually becoming stronger. Unlike Bulat, who had used Incursio in a proper way, Tatsumi had forced an evolution before he was ready for it. When the doctor mentioned the story of how Incursio couldn't have fought the two strongest in the Empire, Tatsumi stated that he could endure any pain as long as he could have power, and this was the cost, as he will grow stronger, but will die soon, probably 10 years or even less. He did note that if Tatsumi continued to train and build up strength, he might be able to use Incursio without overdoing it, but if Tatsumi continued to use Incursio as he was now, he would be devoured by Incursio and die from it, and pointed out how the symptoms already appeared in Tatsumi's right eye. Finally, the doctor stated that Tatsumi had 3-4 more times was Tatsumi's limit. Tatsumi remained determined to keep fighting, and although Najenda wanted to remove Tatsumi from further combat, she couldn't, as they had no idea what Esdeath's trump card would be now, and they needed Incursio, who had adapted to her frozen atmosphere. Najenda and Tatsumi spoke about the Revolution Army's progress, and how they couldn't afford to lower their guard, as they were sure that the Prime Minister had an ace up his sleeve, added with Esdeath's unparalleled strength. Noting how Esdeath would be fighting with full enjoyment, Tatsumi stated that for as long as he knew her, he hid his identity from her, and that Esdeath was persistent in trying to take Tatsumi, but had a feeling that Esdeath won't hold back on Tatsumi anymore. He declared he would fight with all his might to defeat her, and added that he would fight Lubbock's part as well, though Najenda told him to not beat himself over it, as Night Raid was all for one, and one for all. After a briefing with Najenda with the revolutions armed forces, Tatsumi along with the rest of Night Raid set out to deal with the remnants of the Wild Hunt. Who've last been spotted raiding various Revolution Army Bases with the newly recreated cosmina, just as the Drothea and the others were prepping to raid another base to feed her pet creation. Akame and the rest of Night Raid swooped in; the former dealing what seemed to be a deathblow to the homunculus. But as she rises back up again after having sheded her philosopher stone, Tastumi stands firm as she takes on the monstrosity, remembering that he could only use his Teigu four more times before Tyrant consumed him but shook off his insecurity when thinking of Mine and charged at the enemy fearlessly. Tatsumi bifurcates Cosmina After Dorthea had finished dispatching Leone Cosmina had come crashing in just as she was contemplating how she was doing against him. After, loping off her a limb and landing some critical blows against the creature she protrudes a slew of tendrils to attack him, after blocking most of the barrage a hidden coil springs up from the ground jabbing through incursio's shin guard. As poison is funneled into his body he reveals his immunity to said toxins by tackling Cosmina with as much ferocity as ever, the alchemist suspecting that Tatsumi's merging with his Teigu enabling him resilience against contaminants after having adapted to survive the prime ministers cowardly ploy during his execution. As Leone and Akame finish up with their respective opponents Tatsumi deals the killing blow against the mutated Cosmina causing her creator to feign collapse at the crumbling of her ambitions, only to be crushed flat under a rock by Leone soon after. After having completed their mission Leon and Akame stand outside of Tatsumi's room only to find he's not in. Meanwhile, outside Night Raid's base Tatsumi sits alone in a cave groaning and agonizing in isolation due to his second use of the evolved incursio. After Leone and Akame find him through tracking his scent only to find that half of his face has transformed to reflect tyrants own visage, not wanting to concern the others over his pains Tatsumi tried his best to conceal his problems only for the two to gently embrace him reassuring that they'll help him through his turmoil. Tatsumi after just one use of the evolved Incursio Back at the base Tatsumi shows more control over his transformations now being able to revert back to a more human appearance at will, when the commander comes in to debrief Akame on a new mission she also recommends He and Leone take a breather. After Akame had successfully completed her hit list assignment and was told that Tatsumi was resting up after feelings of exhaustion rose up in him. After the Empire Assassination squads have been dealt with Tatsumi and what remains of Night Raid sit down and enjoy a bite too eat. The former of which laments not being of much use seeing as the rest of the crew are busting their butts doing all the heavy work while he's stuck in the benches, the rest however comment that he's not to engage in any combat until the apex of the war Najenda promising to work him but good when the time comes, Leone following sweet by glomping onto him soon after. Noting a somber Akame leaving the dinner table Tatsumi notes her unusual quietness but both ladies are unsurprised seeing as she'll be dealing with her little sister soon. As was per the agreement when Akame initially joined up with the Revolutionary Army, Tatsumi learns that in order to serve under them that she be given leeway on approach regarding her wayward sibling and that when the time had come that she; Akame herself and no one else would interfere with her settling things with her, Leone affirms her desire to help her comrade meet her own goals if and when it comes to that with Najenda going onto say that in the even Kurome is spared and the revolution being over by then. That the army whom originally marked her for termination will cease all hostilities towards her and permit Akame to watch over her, and that the elder of the two had been working rather diligently for so long in order too have these requests met. Having long come to terms with Akame's designs and fully considering the possibilities of Kurome rejecting her proposal, leading the two to fight it out to the death; without getting either sides of the conflict involved in order to make it between just the two of them, Tatsumi professes he shares the same mindset as Leone in supporting whatever decision Akame comes too in the end; Najenda noting Tatsumi's more calm demeanor compared to way back when. As Akame sits outside under an oak tree looking up at the starless sky Tatsumi comes up to her wondering if she should be asleep by now or not. His hostess admits she's too restless at the moment, Tatsumi states that he's coming with her to oversee the battle between sisters and while Akame rebukes this stating that this is between family he retorts that because she's his friend and that this is her problem he will come as an impartial observer. Neither as a member of Night Raid nor an emissary of the Rebel Army, just standing guard as to keep anyone from interfering with they're business. Akame notes that they're boss said he shouldn't be fighting now until the apex of the war itself, but he states that while she's only worried about his state of being from when last he equipped Incursio that he'd happily give up another usage if it's for a comrade in arms stating he can only use it four more times before he's done in by it. Stating he was shocked that they left him behind the last time when the call to arms was sounded and that this was his way of making amends for his inaction, also mentioning he has no intention of dying seeing as he has to go back to Mine assuming they win the war but could not stand living with himself if something were to happen to a friend while he was resting up for the battle ahead when he could have been there for them. Tatsumi asks Akame to kill him if he becomes possessed by Tyrant Akame thanks him for his kindness and determination sharing with him that her TeiguMurasamehas a hidden trump card that she's unable to use due to it requiring she cast aside her humanity and become a vicious man-slaying demon. Asking him as his friend that if she should succumb to the demon within using this hidden aspect of her weapon, that Night Raid would end her on the spot stating it would be an honor to have him end her before she becomes a ravenous butcher. Impressed by this statement Tatsumi goes onto request from Akame; that should Incursio consumes him and he becomes Tyrant's new body that she would be there to put him down as well. Saying that for him it too would be an honor to die at the hands of a comrade. Knowing full well what that means, Tatsumi states his past self would denote such a request as cowardly feeling that Akame would say you have Mine to go back too plus the fact that he promised her he would survive till the end of it all. But Tatsumi cuff's such understanding by stating Akame is selfishly asking her dear friend to end her should she end up crossing the event horizon, Akame can only laugh as Tatsumi says the best they can do is give it they're all in the end. As the time of the sisters fateful duel came upon them Both he and Leone stood by on the sidelines as the two sisters exchanged friendly commerce of the old days. Meanwhile when the battle between the two intensifies Wave manages to close in on they're location forcing Tatsumi to forfeit one of his Teigu's uses in order to repel boarders after he tried to intervene. As Wave finally did get past his defense, Tatsumi showed up just as the interloper managed to dissuade the fighting, offering to take himself and Kurome out of the revolutionary war after having admitted his love for said teammate just as Leone comes in after checking the surrounding area for more insurgents. But this causes Kurome to mentally break down due to her conflicting natures of not wanting to fight her sister and her loyalties to a corrupt empire that ruined her life; to sever such anointment's tying her down, the remnants of Night Raid witness as the former Jeager smashes her Yatsufusa. Carrying her off to unknown territory taking themselves out of the conflict off of the Jeagers Afterwards, Tatsumi shows further signs of degradation due to Incursio's influence once he diffused his weapon, a moment to which Akame laments due to her feeling responsible. But they all cheer up after Leone mentions how Wave single-handedly prevented the deathly battle between siblings and removed two Jeagers from the equation saving countless lives. Tatsumi & Esdeath clash once again When the time for the assault on the empire arrived, Tatsumi would be on the front-line battling Esdeath's formidable ice cavalry. Soon, Esdeath herself joins the battle, seeking to crush the revolutionary army's commander only to be halted by Tatsumi. Despite being a bit winded during their brief one on one battle, Tatsumi while getting stronger, fought a now serious Esdeath to a standstill until the empire signaled her to retreat. Upon seeing the Empire's trump card, Shikoutazer on the field, Tatsumi wasted no time rushing to confront the young emperor. Due to the emperor being confused and inexperienced with the ultimate teigu, Tatsumi easily dodged its assaults and landed a counterattack giving him as well as the revolutionary army confidence that he could prevail. Once Shikoutazer's trump card ""purge mode"" had been activated, the Emperor seemed to lose his remaining sanity and began firing indiscriminately. Witnessing the destruction, Tatsumi attempted to get the mad Emperor to understand what he was doing only to be met with resistance. Tatsumi would continue to bounce between being defensive and offensive until a stray missile headed towards civilians prompted him to jump in between the two. By saving the civilians, Tatsumi was left open for incoming attacks. The Emperor then pierced Tatsumi with a blade extending from the ultimate Teigu and subsequently punched into the ground. With Incursio smashed and nearing death, Tatsumi saw an image of Mine, after apologizing and saying he'd return to her when suddenly he's healed and Incursio fixed. Although shocked at first, he realizes what has occurred and incursio sprouts a pair of dragon wings declaring he'll stop the Emperor no matter the cost. Incursio's second evolved form Before Shikoutazer could prepare to attack again, Wave arrived on the scene with the intention of evacuating civilians and because he owed Tatsumi a debt. Despite his team up with Wave, Tatsumi determined that he needed more power to defeat his foe and thus he forced Incursio to evolve once more. After obtaining more power, Tatsumi was able to force the Emperor to go on the defense and together with Wave they were able to heavily damage Shikoutazer's armor. Once Wave leaves to help civilians, Tatsumi is able to give his full attention where he once again tries to have the Emperor see the destruction he's causing only to be met with resistance again. Recalling Susanoo's advice, Tatsumi searches for and locates the weakened area within Shikoutazer's armor. The Emperor calls for aid prompting Esdeath's appearance which worries Tatsumi because their team up would ruin his gained momentum. Akame arrives and holds the general at bay while Tatsumi focuses on Shikoutazer. Upon asking for more power, Tatsumi feels his consciousness slipping again and with some encouragement from a imagined Bulat, Tatsumi is able to regain his consciousness and Incursio evolves one final time. With his new power, Tatsumi is able to plow through Shikoutazer's blasts, its weakened armor, and right through its body to finally destroy the Teigu and end the Empire's reign after more than a thousand years. Immediately after destroying the ultimate Teigu, Tatsumi is overcome by Tyrant's influence and retrained. The revolutionary doctor concludes that upon receiving a fatal wound, Incursio possessed Tatsumi only for his burning passion to keep him in check. Tatsumi escapes his retrains and heads for Esdeath where Akame begs him to fall back only for Tatsumi to respond by saying Mine must be cold and that he wants to be of some use before he's completely overtaken by Tyrant. Tatsumi smashes through several of Esdeath's attacks and is later wounded by her. Before he could attack Akame who had rushed to his aid, Tatsumi was able to stop himself and begged Akame to kill him before his conscious completely faded. He also reminded Akame about her promise to kill him should he turn into a dragon. Akame than stabs him with Murasame and its curse's markings spread over his body as he collapses. After Akame mortally wounds Esdeath, Tatsumi is seen flying towards them. After meeting up with Akame and Najenda, it is explained that Akame only targeted and killed the Tyrant but saved Tatsumi. Happy that he is still alive, even as a dragon, Tatsumi thanks Akame for helping him keep the promise he made to her to survive."
What does Tatsumi inherit from Bulat?,a spear,Equipment and skills,"Tatsumi with Incursio Tatsumi, at first, does not have aTeigu, using instead a short-sized broadsword as his primary choice of weaponry. Tatsumi's skill with the sword is so great that he is able to defeat opponents as dangerousCaptain Ogrewhile also being able to hold his own against Teigu users likeZankuandNyaufor a good amount of time without having a Teigu of his own. Tatsumi is also skilled enough to survive longer than most when faced againstAkamein his first appearance. Tatsumi later becomes capable of using a spear to where he can split two Giant LizardDanger Beastsin half from their mouth to the tip of their tail in a single movement. He later inherits one fromBulat, becoming the successor ofIncursio. During Tatsumi's first activation of his Teigu, Tatsumi forces the demon armor to evolve to match his movements and battle-style. Soon after, Tatsumi disciplines himself to new extends in order to fully master his new Teigu, unlocking its abilities at a staggering rate. Thanks to Bulat's training on Mt. Fake, Tatsumi is able to develop a sixth sense, becoming more aware of his surroundings. After the one month time-skip,Leonecomments on how Tatsumi was getting closer and closer to Bulat's level of strength and proficiency after seeing him materialize and utilizeNeuntote, the spear/halberd auxiliary weapon. Even before obtaining a Teigu, Tatsumi was a force to be reckoned with due to his already honed battle skills. Having been taught swordsmanship and hand-to-hand combat by an ex-military official since a young age, Tatsumi has since improved, being able to take much large and experienced opponents down with ease. After having donned Incursio for the first time, Tatsumi begins to rely on unarmed hand-to-hand combat more often than he used to, and is seen to be exceptionally skilled in fighting opponents even while unarmed, as seen during a tournament held by Esdeath, utilizing the devastating, remarkable physical strength he possesses, and supplementing this with his close quarters combat skill. Upon training his body in order to master his Teigu, Tatsumi becomes able to defeat a member of the ""Temple of the Imperial Fist"" despite the difference in both size and experience with ease without having to use Incursio. Tatsumi's overall strength becomes so high that while using Incursio, he can easily obliterate a boulder many times his own size. Even without Incursio, Tatsumi has shown that he was strong enough to lift a bear-like Danger Beast with ease after killing it. After forcing Incursio to evolve once more through his strong emotions, Tatsumi's strength and speed had reached to incredibly high levels that he managed to fight on par with both Esdeath and Budo, especially due to Incursio having also evolved to be able to resist both ice and lightning attacks, the former of which allows Tatsumi to even resist the effects of Esdeath's Trump Card, Mahapadma, for a moment. From Bulat's advice of being aware of his surroundings, Tatsumi had managed to avoid one of Budo's lightning attacks, allowing him to deal a powerful blow that injured Budo. Another thing to note is that similar to how Wave is the first one in the series to deal a clean, powerful blow on Akame, Tatsumi is the only one to have ever done the same to Esdeath as well as General Budo, a feat that surprised Esdeath, Akame, and even Tatsumi himself. However, this is more due to how Esdeath's affections for Tatsumi, added with her enjoyment of the battle along with the Great General's lack of combat experience coupled with blind fury, had given Tatsumi an opening for both instances. From the forced evolution of Incursio, the Teigu has begun to bond with Tatsumi, to the point that Tatsumi was to become Tyrant's new dragon body, something that would break and kill Tatsumi, giving him a limit of 3-4 more uses of Incursio before the effects take over fully. This has also made it that he is now resistant against poison, even a deadly one from Cosmina, due to how he had managed to survive the poison trap the Prime Minister had placed on Incursio's hilt that would have fell a High Class Danger Beast in an instant. This also allowed Tatsumi to fight, overwhelm, and kill Cosmina when she became a hybrid Danger Beast. Dorothea claimed that Cosmina would have had advantage over Tatsumi if she had fed on other humans for another two days. Though, despite this statement, Tatsumi was able to repel both Budo and Esdeath, two of the Empire's strongest. Esdeath once carefully noted how powerful Tatsumi became and how Incursio continued to evolve, as shown when they battled on the day of the Revolution. Despite unable to land a fatal blow on the Empire's strongest, he is still shown to be more than able to hold his own against her and even hold her back from attacking the rebels. This proves his sheer strength and ability to adapt to his opponent. Tatsumi is even able to be hit by Esdeath's dangerous 'Hagel Sprung' technique with no injuries whatsoever. Tatsumi reaches the pinnacle of his strength after forcing his Teigu to evolve once more, needing a boost of power to defeatShikoutazer, Tatsumi is shown to receive a massive increase in power, to the point where he can inflict serious damage to Shikoutazer. He is able to destroy the Supreme Teigu in a matter of two hits, the second one piercing through the Supreme Teigu's weakened area. He is also able to withstand Shikoutazer's devastating artillery strikes. Unfortunately, despite this transformation being indescribably powerful, it is not shown to last long as Incursio's influence quickly brings it to an end. Tatsumi is an all-around fighter with a mountain load of potential that is noticed by Leone, Bulat,EsdeathandBudoamong others. Leone is the first to notice Tatsumi's potential and recommends him as a new recruit. Bulat believes that Tatsumi will someday surpass him and leave him in the dust. Esdeath believes that with enough training, Tatsumi can become general-class. General Budo noted Tatsumi's prowess and ability in the heat of combat, remarking it all the more since he fused to his Teigu. Other than his fighting abilities, Tatsumi is capable of using a forge to repair and create weapons. Although his skills at blacksmithing are only at a beginner's level, it is still used as his cover while in the Capital as shown when he is announced as 'Tatsumi the Blacksmith' during Esdeath's competition. Tatsumi is also shown to be a very capable chef, having done some of the cooking for Night Raid at the beginning of his career."

What was Esdeath known to do for her subordinates?,letting them do as they please,Personality,"Esdeath was a manipulative and barbarous sadist who lacked empathy for people whom she deemed weak since she lived by her father's philosophy . She enjoyed putting her enemies through great pain, both physically and emotionally. She had no qualms about killing innocent people to get what she wanted and rationalized her behavior with her father's old creed. Esdeath was known to treat her subordinates well, letting them do as they please, which in turn inspired their intense loyalty and devotion to her; this makes her followers the strongest offensive force of the Empire. To her credit, Esdeath has demonstrated genuine care for her subordinates - the Three Beasts and Jaegers in particular - and unhesitatingly authorized them to kill Tatsumi should he ever endanger their lives. Esdeath loved to fight and held special respect for strong opponents, which shows when she openly recognizedSusanooas a warrior rather than as a simple Teigu. Her love of battle has occasionally inspired her to take actions that would incite more hatred against the Empire, in the hopes of being able to put down more rebellions. She has even stated that should the Empire fall, she would simply start a war herself to satisfy her need for bloodshed. Despite her reputation, Esdeath possessed great charisma, able to inspire many to fight for her. EvenRun, who expected her to be a scumbag, softened his stance on her, despite his otherwise apprehension towards her sadism. Although she was unabashedly bloodthirsty, she kept it from dominating her judgment. If she were to see that the battle is too much for her soldiers, she orders a retreat and doesn't risk heavy losses. While she will torture subordinates who fail, she can be forgiving to failed servitors, provided that they aren't complete failures, and gives them the benefit of the doubt if the failure wasn't their fault. However, during the final battle against the Revolutionary Army and the remaining members of the Night Raid, it becomes clear that behind that charismatic military officer lies a person thirsty for battle. This is demonstrated when she used her real trump card to cover the Empire in a Russian winter. Najenda noted that such a technique put Esdeath's subordinates, as well as their families, at risk. Her response of not caring, and once again rationalizing it with her belief in Social Darwinism, showed her cruelty and depravity. Interestingly, in spite of this pure monstrosity, before the final battle, Esdeath spoke of dedicating the battle in the fallen Jaegers group's memory- even more significant with her initial casual dismal uponSeryu Ubiquitous's demise, internally admitting to missing them greatly and envisioning the entire group in her memory. This demonstrates that while she would put her men and their families at risk, she does fondly recall those who were more significant than a lackey and having valued them in high regard; especially, in comparison to theThree Beasts. As shown during the last moments of her life, she admitted that in the end, she didn’t regret a single one of the horrible and awful things she had done in her life and that her only real regret was that she was never able to get Tatsumi to return her feelings for him."
What was Esdeath's father's name?,the clan chief,Before akame ga kill!,"Esdeath as a Child Esdeath was born in theNorthern Frontier Landsand is the sole remaining survivor of her village, thePartas Clan. She spent most of her childhood in the north with her tribe and she was very close with herfather, the clan chief due to the death of her mother at the hand of a super-class Danger Beast. She was a skilled and formidable fighter, even at such a young age. Whenever she caught prey for the tribe, her father would begin gutting the creature without killing it. Due to this, she became comfortable with the idea of inflicting pain on living things. However, her father was worried that this might cause her to lose something that she can't regain, but for her to survive, this was fine with him. Her father told her that in the North, ""the strong live and the weak die"", a creed she kept close to her heart. One day, she returned from an outing to find her tribe destroyed, with everyone either dead or dying. Her father was mortally wounded and soon passed away in her arms. From that day on, she vowed to herself to become stronger. Later, she joinedthe Empire's military, rising through the ranks rapidly, and, at some point, the Prime Minister allowed her to choose aTeigu. She noticedonethat was chained off from the others, felt that it was calling for her and chose it. Instead of drinking one glass, which would have been enough, she drank the whole thing. After taming the Teigu, Esdeath would gain the title of the strongest in the Empire. After gaining her Teigu, at some point later, she would become aware of GeneralLiver's incarceration and free him. Later, she would be ordered by the Empire to go with Boss and ""make an example"" of theBan Tribethat had risen in rebellion against the Empire. Using her mastery over ice, she froze an entire river that cut her army off from the tribes' main village and used this makeshift ice bridge to cross over and defeat them, capturing their leaders. She then ordered her army to ""violate this town until [they were] satisfied,"" resulting in the mass murders of civilians as well as the burning of the village to the ground. She forced the leaders to watch their village ""violated"" to encourage future insubordination to the Empire. Sometime after this, she is told to go subjugate theNorthern Tribes. Her forces defeated them faster than anyone expected. During this conquest, she buried 400,000 of its people alive, and broke the heroNuma Seika's sanity and pride, forcing him to strip naked and lick her boots before killing him. Following her return to the Capital, Esdeath has stated that she wishes to try her hand at falling in love. She provides a list of short but incredibly specific qualifications tothe Emperorand thePrime Minister."
"Who does Esdeath form a new group of wielders she subsequently names ""Jaegers"" to hunt down the members of Night Raidand to maintain peace and order throughout the empire?",the Three Beasts,Events of akame ga kill!,"On a request fromHonest, she sends theThree Beaststo lure out Night Raid by having them kill his political enemies. After the death of her three bodyguards at the hands ofTatsumiandBulat, Esdeath forms a new group of Teigu wielders she subsequently names ""Jaegers"" to hunt down the members ofNight Raidand to maintain peace and order throughout the empire. Following the formation of the Jaegers, Esdeath holds a tournament to determine a new wielder forExtase, the Teigu secured fromSheelefollowing her death, as she knew that if there was no wielder the Prime Minister will take possession of it. Esdeath also takes advantage of this event to find a proper lover that will fulfill her requirements. Tatsumi participates in the tournament to gather information and hopefully, if he wins, obtain money to send back to his village which was ultimately his original goal before becoming entwined in the war between the Resistance and the Empire. His incredible skill and bright, warm smile attract Esdeath's attention and she instantly falls in love with him, completely oblivious to the fact that he is a member of the opposing force. Snapping a collar on his neck, Esdeath knocks out Tatsumi and drags him back to the Jaeger's headquarters. Seeing an advantage in her affections,Tatsumitries unsuccessfully to defect Esdeath to Night Raid. His attempts to convince her to leave the empire fall upon deaf ears and Esdeath sternly retorts that it is she who will change and control him and not vice versa. After a few days with theJaegers, Tatsumi manages to narrowly escape from Esdeath, and a hostile Wave, who spotted Incursio and recognized it as a Teigu belonging toBulatand attacked. Tatsumi's departure only serves to increase Esdeath's longing. After she lost him, Esdeath begins to feel depressed and noted the change in herself while she was on night patrol and how she went out because of how pretty the moon was. Something that was very out of character for her. When she noted a person on Mount Fake, she jumped down to fight him, only to find that it is Tatsumi, much to her delight . Esdeath's and Tatsumi's second kiss During their encounter, a mysterious individual clad in a coat appears after Esdeath easily cuts down a group of Danger Beasts. Before she can attack or capture the man however, he activates his Teigu,Shambhala, and instantly teleports both Esdeath and Tatsumi to an unidentified South-Eastern island. On the island, they encounter a danger beast nearly identical toDr. Stylish's final monster form, and using her Demon's Extract Teigu, she fairly quickly dispatches the colossalDanger Beasts. Esdeath later sits down with Tatsumi to discuss their pasts before the mysterious Teigu user activates the previous portal, allowing Tatsumi to slip away into it and back onto the mountain. Esdeath chases after him but loses sight of Tatsumi after he engages Incursio's invisible ability, and hides behind a rock. After Esdeath is done reminiscing and wondering where Tatsumi had gone, she received word that Night Raid was spotted on the outskirts of the Empire. Along with the Jaegers, she headed toward them in expectations of Najenda and her tricks. The entire ordeal ended up being part of a rouse by Night Raid as their plan went astray, and even went as far as to lose a member of the Jaegers. Unfortunately for Esdeath, she was played skillfully and was used to clean up a large group of Bandits. Immediately after their battle in the outskirts of the Empire, Esdeath & her Jaegers received their new mission of protectingBolic, an Empire spy in the ranks of the Path of Peace. The Jaegers were assigned to overlook the well being of Bolic under the assumption that Night Raid would attack. Just as predicted, Night Raid invaded. During the Invasion, Esdeath shows exceptional skill which is well beyond the level of a mere soldier . It is during the fight where she reveals her Demon Extract's Trump card ""Mahapadma"" which can freeze time and space itself. After Bolick was successfully eliminated,Najendaactivated Susanoo's ultimate ability Esdeath returns ""Magatama Manifestation"", in an attempt to create a diversion for Night Raid to escape, intending to sacrifice both herself and Susanoo. Esdeath attempted to hinder Susanoo from throwing the Night Raid members out of the building but fails. After Night Raid's escape, an angry Esdeath strikes down Susanoo and shatters his core, killing him permanently. After the conflict between Wild Hunt with Run turned into a corpse, Esdeath returns from the invasion with the Western Tribe Nation, leaving her army there. And from hearing the news about Run, Esdeath is vexed with Wild Hunt and claims that they will not get away with this; despite the close relations Wild Hunt has with the Prime Minister. The big reveal A week later, Tatsumi and Lubbock are trapped inside the palace, Tatsumi is agitated by numerous attacks from Wild Hunt causing him to wield Incursio. Esdeath appears and is ultimately shocked, finally realizing that Tatsumi is a member of Night Raid. As Tatsumi tries to escape, successfully eluding the members of Wild hunt and is almost successful in escaping with Lubbock, Esdeath stops Tatsumi by knocking him down to the ground, claiming she will never let him run away again. Tatsumi is then defeated byBudoand he and Lubbock are then captured. As Tatsumi regains consciousness, he is met byDorotheaandSuzukawho mean to violate him, through means of torture. As they begin their attempt, Esdeath arrives and quickly smashes Suzuka's face into a wall. Esdeath then threatens Dorothea and tells her to inform the rest of Wild Hunt to never touch Tatsumi again, emitting a powerful aura as she does so, leaving Dorothea terrified at her killing intent. Upon meeting Tatsumi's eyes, she sighs that while she has lots of things she wants to say and questions she wants to ask him when she sees his face none of it matters to her anymore and she embraces Tatsumi while blushing. Tatsumi, however, says that he still has no intention of joining her but Esdeath tells him they can talk about that some other time and that he should not think about whether they are friends or enemies as she leans in to kiss him. Tatsumi then pushes her away, leaving her shocked. She asks why he is refusing her kiss, Tatsumi then confesses that he already has someone he likes and that he is already going out with her, leaving Esdeath shocked. Despite being surprised about Tatsumi's relationship, Esdeath makes Tatsumi food and tries to feed him, claiming one of the dishes as her specialty. Esdeath then plans to win Tatsumi over by making him her subordinate, making the arrangements so that his past crimes will disappear. Tatsumi then says to her that until she has done something for Lubbock, he refuses to negotiate. Esdeath then informs Tatsumi of Lubbock's fate, as well as saying that he only has that night to accept that offer before he is executed. Enraged by the loss of Lubbock, Tatsumi blatantly rejects Esdeath's offers, saying he would not serve the Empire that he is prepared to die. Esdeath begins to panic and tells him to not think about it as serving the Empire but becoming hers. Tatsumi again rejects the offer, causing Esdeath to panic with a Esdeath concluding that Tatsumi will be killed by her own hands worried face. Esdeath is then taken by surprise as she realizes that the sun has risen and that the time Tatsumi had is up, with Tatsumi once again saying that he would not change his mind. Esdeath then concedes that Tatsumi is not going to change his mind, and says that if he can't be hers, then she will kill him herself so that no one else will touch him. She then grips her fist and declares that 'Tatsumi of Night Raid' will die. At the execution grounds, Budo asks Esdeath whether or not Night Raid will show up fro one of they're own even with the TeiguIncursioset up as bait to lure them out, commenting on how naive Najenda is the possibility was likely. When Budo is asked why he so humbly serves the corrupt prime minister, only to reply his duty is to serve the empire and defeat it's enemies; quoting that once the rebellion has been dealt with he would personally dispose of the Minister; Esdeath only smiles knowing full well that would set them at odds with one another in the future and is looking forward to the conflict. Once all pleasantries are settled and the cruel general moved to murder a smiling Tatsumi after boasting her knowledge of all human vital spots just as part of the execution stands are blown away.Minecome bursting through proudly exclaiming she is of Night Raid and had come to save her boyfriend, this bold statement greatly incenses her rival for Tatsumi's affections. An Evolved battle After the assassin dispatches Budo flinging him through a wall with herPumpkinEsdeath immediately goes on the attack. With the augmented power of her Teigu, Mine easily repels her barrage of ice daggers while freeing Tatsumi at the same time, who moves to retrieve his weapon, inciting him to don his armament while commenting to herself she never intended to kill him but instead, fake a killing blow so she could whisk him away when this sham of an execution set up by the minister had been set and done but found this to be much more enjoyable than her previous plans. After dodging another shot from Mine she muses about how she was able to approach Tatsumi and that she would endear in pulling her apart limb from limb. After Mine denounces her as the psychotic gutter trash the rumors depicted her as and would never let her anywhere near him, as the dueling bicker more they're interrupted by an abrupt burst of energy created by an Evolving Incursion. When the smoke clears Tatsumi emerges from it in an upgraded form doing fierce and heavy-handed battle with his obsessive enemy. Elated by this Esdeath feels they are truly connecting but Tatsumi retorts that she can no longer be lax while in combat. After Esdeath evades Tatsumi Mine fires a full-power charge shot forcing her to use Mahapadma to freeze her surroundings, as she moves in to execute Mine Tatsumi suddenly shoots in behind her within the frozen time-space knocking her back. Having deduced Incursio's evolved state had somehow adapted to her stilled atmosphere while marveling at Tatsumi's ability to wield it, her trump card ends with Mine none the wiser as to whats happened as her assailant sets to finish what she started with the former, only to be interrupted by the timely arrival of Night Raid heralded by Akame. As General Budo recuperates from his initial assault spiting the crew of assassins for disturbing the Empire's peace, swearing to eliminate them all in a clash of thunder and lightning. Esdeath grins eagerly, waiting to engage in the horrendous conflict to come. While Budo begins his frontal assault, Esdeath strikes from behind attacking Akame while also dodging Mine's cover fire, she comments the two's gun & sword combo make them a lethal combo. As Akame nears landing a killing blow she is stopped by a thin layer of ice for armor with the latter noting and gloating over her lack of strength, this is made up for however by Akame's irregular motions and Mine's precision marksmanship. Tatsumi lands the first successful blow against Esdeath After claiming to have grasped Akame's technique noting how she'll enjoy crushing her beneath her boot, but a stray bolt of lightning soon disrupts their bout. Esdeath made immediately aware that Budo is royally peeved by the crashing storm, surmising the only one capable of such a feat was Tatsumi. As the battles intensify Esdeath cleverly interrupts opting that she was assigned to execute Tatsumi snatching him away from her fellow general, much to the irate commanders charging whose attentions were drawn away by the rest of night raid. After which a heavy rain of thunder crashes with the earth but Esdeath reminds a concerned Tatsumi that she is his opponent beckoning him to come at her with everything, impressed by his rapid growth she contemplates as strong as he is he's still not up to her league. Opting to capture him by encasing him in a block of ice but her adversary evades, awestruck at how Tatsumi was growing even as they fought. With a heavy blow, Tatsumi strikes Esdeath who blocks him with frigid arm guards but when the latter discards his weapon to make another attack, the general throws up another ice armor guard only for it to crumble under Tatsumi's mighty strike. A gut-punch landed sends the sadistic adversary reeling a good distance away, taking her out of the fight. After making their successful escape having finally dispatched Great General Budo at the cost of Mine, Esdeath's train of thoughts drifts towards how powerful Tatsumi had become but also because her womanly instinct got the better of her she disrespected him as a warrior, promising once again to meet up with her beloved on the battlefield, someday. As the empire preps to make final preparations for the upcoming climax of the war; noting that the opposing army has no real opposition worth her time or focus, she notes that the real threat comes from whoever's supplying their forces with its arsenal is. Esdeath experimenting with her abilities Esdeath soothes Waves concerns over the lack of manpower and deserting forces on they're front by directing both his and Kurome's attention towards a secret weapon within they're forces ranks that can decimate the Revolutionary Armies forces in droves. She revels in the idea of how strenuous a truly thrilling war can be when asked by wave whether she still loved Tatsumi even knowing his true identity. She rewards his concern with an honest reply while loving him still even as an enemy she knows her feelings won't reach him due to his convictions and resolves to kill him outright but she's also fine if she dies by his hand as well, naturally, this unsettles Wave considerably but Kurome simply smiles in agreement. While alone in her quarters she experiments with the fluidity of control over her Teigu. Sometime later, when informed by a retainer that the revolutionary army had been approaching she immediately set out to rally the troops, Esdeath is next seen fighting forces from the Revolutionary Army.Nugeattempts to kill her withL'Arc Qui Ne Faut, but she easily blocks it and proceeds to kill him. She then notes that she was coming up with new ways to use her Teigu. Esdeath announcing that the long awaited war had finally arrived Sometime after Wave and Kurome's ""deaths"", two spies infiltrate the Imperial Capital military drill grounds and learns of Esdeath's new trump card which creates soldiers of ice to substitute for regular infantry. Honest compliments Esdeath's ice cavalry and claims that their opponents will be at a loss once they learn of their ability to create more soldiers. Esdeath reaffirms that her troops have currently fortified their position in the west and that the upcoming war will be the war that ends all wars. She thinks about Wave and Kurome believing they simply died because they were too weak and that their deaths were outside of her control. She reminisces about her former subordinates thinking that they had shared plenty of wonderful times. She announces the upcoming battle will be a tribute to all of her subordinates and that the long-awaited war has finally arrived. On the morning of the war, Suzuka kneels before Esdeath and asks that she become a messenger between Esdeath and the Prime Minister. She accepts Suzuka's request and confesses to her that she respects her lack of hesitation when facing her. Suzuka offers to lick her boots but Esdeath declines, saying that if the person wishes to lick them then it defeats the purpose. Later when the war finally began, Esdeath is on the walls looking at the incoming army with excitement. The revolutionary army begins firing cannons towards the walls which she easily destroys her ice abilities. The revolutionary army then proceeded to summon numerous danger beasts in an attempt to destroy the walls but Esdeath orders Suzuka to give the signal to summon their army of Danger Beasts. She laughs watching the scene unfold and comments that this was a fitting ceremony to commemorate the final war. Once the Danger Beasts had fallen, she ordered her ice cavalry to charge but Tatsumi charged in himself to fight them off. Esdeath joins the battle Eventually, she grasps her enemies movements and charges on a horse made out of ice into battle. While she is attacking the revolutionary army's troops the northern gate gets breached so she decided to try to crush the other army's supreme commands but is stopped by Tatsumi. She begins to attack Tatsumi with her full strength but Tatsumi grabs her arm. She attempts to freeze him but he quickly manages to escape. Esdeath comments on Tatsumi's heavy breathing, telling him that she isn't even warmed up yet. As the battle continues Tatsumi continues to grow strong, much to Esdeath excitement however their battle is cut when a retreat signal is rung. Esdeath congratulates Tatsumi on managing to hold her back and says that they should meet again soon before riding off. After Tatsumi begins to overwhelm theEmperor's Teigu, she is summoned to assist him but is intercepted by Akame. She blocks Akame with her ice but the ice is soon destroyed. She quickly deduces that Akame must have used a Teigu to boost her abilities. Esdeath questions whether she should be here facing her rather than trying to slash the giant Teigu but Akame confesses that it had no effect and that she is going to do her original mission, taking Esdeath's head. Esdeath notes that Akame is resolved this battle to be the final battle before Akame charges towards Esdeath. Esdeath tells her that she will bear witness to how strong Akame has become. Esdeath's favourite dance After the supreme Teigu had fallen, Esdeath and Akame are still fighting with the latter covered with her blood. Akame tells her that the empire had fallen which Esdeath agrees too and says that this is now her battle. Esdeath charges at Akame but she blocks and tries to counterattack forcing Esdeath on the defensive. Esdeath notes that Akame is adapting countermeasures against her and is even reacting to her attacks so she will have to start to outplay her as well. She excitedly thinks that this is her favourite dance that she just loves. Eventually, Akame begins to become exhausted but Najenda and the revolutionary army arrives to help defeat Esdeath. Najenda claims that they will defeat her in a war of attrition but Esdeath is still confident that she can win and activates her final trump card, ice storm commander in chief, by sacrificing her ice cavalry and covers a large part of the empire in ice and snow. The new wielderbelvaac, along with several other soldiers, try charging at Esdeath but are quickly frozen. Enjoying Najenda's reaction she challenges the revolutionary army to try to defeat her. She begins slaughtering the soldiers until Tatsumi, who has now become a tyrant, attacks her directly. Despite this, she still manages to kill countless of soldiers including multiple Teigu users. During the fight, she casually raises her hand in the air and Akame immediately takes advantage of this and cuts her arm. Esdeath quickly uses Mahapadma to stop the poison from spreading and amputates her arm. While Mahapadma is still in effect Tatsumi tries to attack her but she counters with an ice blade and injuries Tatsumi. Seeing that Esdeath was missing an arm, the revolutionary army charges at her but to no avail. Just before she kills another Teigu user she notices Akame activating her trump card, Little War Horn. Esdeath accepts her death Akame attacks her again, surprising Esdeath with her new speed and power. Esdeath creates a wall to separate the two from the rest of the army saying that she doesn't want to be interrupted. Seeing Akame beginning to tire, she drops her rapier and creates an ice golem with her inside it so she wouldn't be able to cut her. When Akame cuts through the ice Esdeath breaks out of her ice and catches the sword and proceeded to shatter it. Akame quickly picks up Esdeath's sword and stabs Murasame's handle which pushes the broken blade into Esdeath's chest. After being stabbed she admits that she let her focus slip from Mursame after she had destroyed it. She looks up into the air and notices Tatsumi was still alive. She fully admits defeat and in her final moments, she thinks about she failed to make Tatsumi look at her and that this failure was her last and only regret. After being defeated by Akame, Esdeath froze and shattered her own body, leaving no corpse behind. Despite this however, the arm she had amputated was retrieved bySuzukaand was preserved using her knowledge on Alchemy. Suzuka would then go into hiding with Esdeath’s limb."
What did Esdeath use her Teigu to do?,"create icicles, freeze people to death and more",Teigu,"She possessed a powerful Teigu calledDemon's Extractthat allowed her to manipulate ice and mold it from nothing. Due to her ego and immense mental willpower, she was able to withstand the Teigu's overwhelming insanity and obtain its abilities. She used it to create icicles, freeze people to death and more. When she was still starting out with her Teigu, she has been able to freeze an entire lake within moments with her ability. And during her conquest, she was able to freeze thousands of Rebel Soldiers in an instant. However, using her Teigu on a massive scale like that renders her unable to use it for a while and must rest. Another testament to Esdeath’s power is that was actually capable of creating her own Trump Card techniques for her Teigu. Something no other Teigu user has ever been able to accomplish as the Teigu themselves had such functions built into them by their creators in the first place. Furthermore, Esdeath herself has developed numerous Trump Cards:"
How many Teigu users does Esdeath have?,ten,Physical abilities,"Esdeath was considered the finest soldier in the Empire's army and one of the world's strongest, She single-handedly overpowered the entire Revolutionary Army consist of over 100,000 soldiers including ten Teigu users. Ever since her childhood as aDanger Beasttribal hunter, Esdeath became extremely proficient in wielding blades, such as hunting knives and daggers which she used to dissect Danger Beasts for valuable material. Growing up in a region with low temperatures, Esdeath, as well as other members of her tribe, acclimated to harsh winters rather well. As a General ofthe Empire, Esdeath is tremendously adept with arapierand was capable of swift, piercing strikes that could dismember large Danger Beasts in an instant. Even without having to resort to her Teigu, she could fight on an equal level with Akame and an Evolved Incursio enhanced Tatsumi. Esdeath was an extremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant as well, possessing tremendous physical strength, agility and speed as well as immense stamina and endurance, such as being able to smash through a large portion of a mountain when she was young and being able to send Tatsumi, being enhanced by Incursio, crashing to the ground with a single kick. She managed to take down multiple Teigu users using pure might and skill. Esdeath has also displayed superhuman durability and stamina, as seen when she managed to easily mow down hundreds of Revolutionary soldiers by herself and was later able to brush off the Trump Card ofHeavy Pressureas ""nothing but sound"" and continue on fighting and even when she began facing theTeigu Troopsand thenAkamein consecutive battles, Esdeath still managed to dominate them during their battles with no signs of weakening despite being considerably injured and tired. Another testament to Esdeath's inhuman stamina was her apparent ability to withstand the curse ofMurasamefor a extended period of time, this is seen where after she was cut by Akame in her right arm, Esdeath was able to withstand its curse despite the normally debilitating pain inflected by it on its victim rendering them unable to move or think clearly and managed to activateMahapadmain order to slow down its effects before nonchalantly cutting off her infected arm. Later after being fatally stabbed in the chest with the remaining blade and hilt of Murasame, Esdeath showed that not only was she immune to the pain of both the wound and the curse, she was still strong enough to stand up, use and active her own Teigu and freeze herself whole before then shattering her body."
"How did Esdeath overcome the immense, insanity inducing destructive urges, voices and whispers brought about by the Teigu?","she successfully ""conquer"" it and make it her own seconds after drinking it",Mental abilities,"Esdeath has also displayed immense, monstrous mental fortitude and strength. This was first seen after her having obtained her Teigu,Demon's Extract, where unlike all the previous users who attempted to synchronize with the Teigu, Esdeath alone managed to overcome the immense, insanity inducing destructive urges, voices and whispers brought about by the weapon and successfully ""conquer"" it and make it her own seconds after drinking it. Something no other person has ever managed to accomplish since the Teigu's creation. Esdeath again showcased her immense mental strength during the final stage of the Revolution when she was not at all panicked at the fact that she was being surrounded by hundreds ofRevolutionary Armysoldiers without any allies or back up to support her and maintained her cool as she thought out her battle strategy and later upon being subjected toSpectator's Trump Card and being placed in a powerful illusion, Esdeath managed to easily maintain control of her Psyche and later managed to break through its illusion through sheer mental brute strength."

Despite her cold exterior, she has shown to be warm and kind to those she has opened up to. She shows her compassionate side on one occasion by teasing Tatsumi to get his mind off of the death ofSusanoo. Over time, she develops romantic feelings forTatsumi, who returns the same feelings, and the two having officially entered an intimate relationship. Since having begun to date Tatsumi, she has shown a jealous side, such as getting angry overLeone's usual flirty advances into Tatsumi, as well as lecturing him how he has to refuse such advances firmly as he now has a girlfriend. At the same time, she has demonstrated being very worried about Tatsumi's well-being, especially when he has not returned to the hideout contemplating how she would have never thought she would become so anxious due to lack of contact with someone. Mine wants for there to be no racial discrimination, due to the fact because she is of half-foreign blood descent, which led her to be targeted by others as a kid."

During this moment, Mine is momentarily defeated until she recalls her past as well as her memories of Sheele and Chelsea. As Seryu and Koro descend upon her, the surge of emotions allows her to unleash Pumpkin's trump card and bifurcates Koro as well as Seryu. Mine told her she made her mad, which cost her the battle so Seryu's final act was to detonate the bomb she had inside of her body in a last-ditch attempt to kill Mine. Unfortunately, Mine is unable to finish off Seryu due to Pumpkin being overheated. Mine attempts to escape, but due to her injuries, she cannot move far enough in time. The bomb detonates, which finally kills Seryu and Koro. However, Mine is saved at the last second by Tatsumi, foiling Seryu's suicide attempt.

While investigating they once again meet up with the path of peace leader who sits down to talk with them. He tells the pair about how he came to power and Tatsumi tries asking him if he can sense human darkness. He admits that he can sense some darkness in some of the leaders, but since they helped the organization reach as far as it has, he has chosen to trust them. Before leaving, the Path of Peace leader casually comments that Mine and Tatsumi are closer than they were before and that they should treasure the moment. The day before they attacked Bolic, Susanoo prepared everyone's favorite dishes. Mine received a strawberry parfait. Mine tries to offer Tatsumi some, but he was too busy being distracted by Leone to notice her. The team is split into two groups. One group who acts as a diversion and the other who has to assassinate Bolic. Mine is put into the latter. Afterward Mine and Najenda bath together and Najenda tries telling Mine that she should try to confess to Tatsumi before it's too late but Mine decides that it would be better to confess after the battle so that her will to live will be slightly stronger.

What did Leone offer to get Tatsumi into the Imperial Army in exchange for a favor?,"She was the first member of Night Raid to meet Tatsumiin the beginning of the story, offering to get him into the Imperial Army in exchange for a favor.",History,"Leone grew up in the slums of the Capital where she had worked in a massage parlor ever since childhood. She was apparently scouted by the Revolutionary Army after saving some slum children from a group of nobles who were abusing them for sport. She was the first member of Night Raid to meetTatsumiin the beginning of the story, offering to get him into the Imperial Army in exchange for a favor. Taking advantage of his naivety at the outset, she tricks him into treating her to dinner and drinks, and then swindles him out of his money. Later, she reappears and is revealed to be a member ofNight Raid. After the confrontation at Aria's mansion is concluded, she recognizes Tatsumi's skills and tells him from now on, he'll be a member of Night Raid, serving as a way of paying him back for her earlier conning of him. Tatsumi introduced to the Night Raid. Still devastated over the loss his beloved childhood friendsSayoandIeyasu, Leone shows up to cheer him up and to find out if he thought about joining them, but Tatsumi was still hesitant about accepting her offer. She shows him around the hide-out and introduces him to the other members of Night Raid:Sheele,Mine,Bulat,Lubbock,AkameandNajenda. When she meets Najenda, she tells her that she wants to recommend him as a new member of their team. Najenda asked if he showed promise, which Leone affirms. When Tatsumi was given a choice to become part of Night Raid, he wrongly states they are assassins of justice, which caused them to laugh at him. He asked what was so funny and Leone replied ""Tatsumi... No matter how you dress it up, what we're doing is murder."" When they were under attack, Leone stated that her Teigu gives her superhuman strength to beat her enemies to death. She is placed with Tatsumi and sent to the Capital to complete their mission. He realizes that she is very popular in her home district. The two were separated when a gang of men that she had also swindled out of their money came after her, but reunited on time to start their assignment. They enter the targeted building and witness a gang kill a drugged prostitute, a girl who Leone knew from the streets. Together, they eliminated the gangsters in the building. When they finished their mission, Tatsumi asked her what will happen to those girls, she replies that it isn't their problem, but then tells him there is a doctor in the slums who will look after them if she asks him to. Tatsumi notes her kindness with a smile and then she ""marks him"" as hers by licking his ear. They are once again sent on another mission. Their target was the Kobore Brothers under the orders of the Revolutionary Army HQ. The two complete their mission, slaughtering the brothers, and as they leave, Tatsumi hears a child's voice calling for his father, who was one of the brothers. Angry at himself, Tatsumi leaves as fast as he could. The next morning, Tatsumi attempts to clean his bloodstained sword while thinking about how the boy only saw the Kobore brother as a good father, instead of the villain that he was. Leone shows up and tells him that he could scrub the sword for his entire life, but the stain will never fade. While she tries to cheer him up and tell him that she was worried about him because he is too kind, he asks her where she got her teigu and why she fights the Empire. She replies she got her Teigu from a merchant for a good deal who didn't realize how good of a fine object he had on him and she takes great joy in killing people who abuse their power on the weak and helpless. While he finds that her reason gives him strength, he is still troubled. She also told him yet again that moping around isn't going to bring back the person you lost. Later, she is assigned the task of spying on the Imperial general,Esdeath. Leone hides in the air vents above the room Esdeath was resting in, planning to kill her if the chance arises, but is scared off by a particularly violent display of killing intent from the general, who noticed the presence of someone hidden nearby. During the attack on Night Raid's hideout byTeam Stylish, she is hit in the face with a throwing dagger and presumed dead, only later to show up and kill the Stylish-minion who threw it with a single blow, revealing that her Teigu increases her natural regeneration. After Night Raid's fight with Stylish, Leone and Tatsumi fought a group of Danger Beasts together. While they were fighting, she was surprised and impressed by Tatsumi being able to use ""Neuntote"", Incursio's special move, Leone also stated that Tatsumi is coming closer and closer to Bulat. Leone displays that her Teigu also increases her sight and speed as well, She was able to beat the strongest Danger Beast in their area without having a single injury. During the fight with Bols, Kurome, and Wave, Kurome cuts off Leone's left arm. Leone uses her regeneration powers to stop the bleeding but comments that Lubbock would have to come and sew it back together. Night Raid's next major assassination would involve Leone being apart of the underground attack team assigned to distract Esdeath. Unfortunately, thanks to Wave & Run holding off the air team along with Esdeath not coming out, they were forced to confront her head on. While Tatsumi snuck around to Bolic, Najenda, Leone, and Susanoo engaged Esdeath head-on. During the battle, the team while easily overwhelmed and Leone suffered brutal torture at the hands of Esdeath herself. Once Akame and Mine arrived, Leone held back a fleeing Bolic allowing Akame to kill him and at Najenda's command began to retreat. Three months later, Leone would join in the mission to rescue Tatsumi from being executed by Esdeath and General Budo. During Mine's assault on the duo, Leone arrives & saves her along with Akame from Esdeath's barrage and prepared to engage Esdeath and an angry Budo. She and Tatsumi tag-teamed against Budo while Akame and Mine fought Esdeath. Sometime during the battle, Leone was joined by Mine and Akame to combat a weakened Budo only to overwhelmed and nearly defeated. Najenda arrived as evacuation only for Budo to follow them & attempt to kill them. To save everyone, Mine pushed Pumpkin to its limit and ultimately killed Budo at the cost of her becoming comatose. Later on, when the attack on the Capital commences, Leone was tasked with killing the Revolutionary Army's enemies from the inside. Alongside Akame, she snuck into the Capital and they assassinate their targets. While the two of them had split up to kill their enemies quicker, Leone attempted to kill the Prime Minister herself. Leone and Minister Honest began their fight, and she was surprised as she found out that Honest was a Teigu user and was actually skilled at martial arts. Eventually, however, Leone gained the upper hand and almost managed to kill him once and for all, but Honest then revealed the power of his Teigu. The Teigu used its ability to destroy Leone's Lionelle, causing her to return back to her normal state. Honest then used a pistol and fired a shot at her, weakening her significantly. Minister Honest threw Leone off the top of the building causing her to fall down several floors and she seemingly died. Leone, fused with her Teigu However, after the battle between Esdeath and Akame, Leone is revealed to have survived as she follows Honest underground as he tries to escape. She has fused with what's left of her broken Teigu, giving her a more lionlike appearance. She proceeds to easily beat down Honest and even rips his guts out. Leone then drags him all the way to the top of the Palace and throws him over the ledge, just like he did to her earlier, sarcastically telling him to enjoy the time he has left. After the battle, Akame meets up with her and is about to get medical assistance, but she declines and hugged her, revealing that she was only alive because she fused with her Teigu temporarily. She tells Akame that she wants to choose where and when she dies and then says that Akame is her best friend. She bids Akame farewell and enjoys one last night out drinking with her friends. When she walks by the spot where she first met Tatsumi, she smiles while remembering him and falls on the ground. Leone then dies in the street with her last smile still on her face."

When activated, it enhanced her speed, reflexes, strength and regeneration, as well as giving her animal-like characteristics. She was also a skilled spy and manipulator, occasionally using her skills to swindle people out of their money, as seen with Tatsumi. Leone was also a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant, using such skills to fight her enemies, and has managed to fight even the most skilled enemies on even ground, although she usually killed them rather quickly. She stated herself that she preferred sneak attacks to kill her enemies before they could react. Considering this and the fact that she was shown to infiltrate different areas on multiple occasions, it was implied she was incredibly skillful at stealth. She is a valuable member of Night Raid and had shown to be quite powerful. She was able to kill three men with a single kick as well as killing a large Danger-Beast with a single blow. Once using Lionelle's transformation, it was shown that Leone became a deadly fighter. She was shown to easily keep up with Tatsumi while he usedIncursio's armor, as they killed severalDanger Beaststogether as a training method. Lionel has enhanced Leone to inhuman durability, during a fight with General Budo where she was struck down with powerful thunderbolts, she was able to move after a few moments. Also, she seemed to have a sixth sense, being aware of danger beforehand, as shown when Night Raid was attacked by Dr. Stylish. An assassin had used a sneak attack on her, attempting to kill her with a knife before she could react, but she was able to catch the knife in her mouth instead. Lionelle also gave Leone an impressive regenerative ability. During her battles, Leone had lost both an arm and one of her breasts but was able to regenerate them. However, the regeneration is not instant, and takes a very long time to finish."

What is the name of the school where Makoto becomes the headmaster?,Trigger Happy Havoc,Appearance,"At the beginning of theKilling School LifeinDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, Makoto appears to be and believes himself to be a younger teenager, two years of his life having been removed from his memory. He is notably short compared to most of his classmates. He has spiky, desaturated brown hair with a prominentahoge, and washed-out hazel eyes. He wears black jeans, a zipped-up dull green hoodie with a red stripe along the zipper, an open black jacket with gold buttons, and red sneakers with white toes. Makoto's hoodie has an image of a red gas mask in a circle printed on the back of the hood, and the zipper goes all the way up to the top of the hood. He wears a pin shaped like a four-pointed star overlaying a crescent moon; this is pinned to the lapel of his jacket. After joining the Future Foundation post-Killing School Life, Makoto is seen wearing a black suit. InDanganronpa: Another Episode, his hair is noticeably lighter, longer, spikier, and overall slightly more detailed. InDanganronpa 3, it appears that Makoto had cut his hair, as it is considerably shorter. He also looks more mature, though still has a bit round face for his adult age. After he becomes the headmaster of the new Hope's Peak Academy, he wears a black suit and a beige tie, as well as a dark blue sweater vest with a white shirt underneath."
What does Makoto's luck come into play during the events of the Final Killing Game?,saving him from multiple dangerous situations,Talents and abilities,"Makoto got his talent as the Ultimate Lucky Student by winning a lottery out of completely ordinary students, which led to him joining Hope's Peak Academy as the Ultimate Lucky Student. In addition to this, he was caught up in a bizarre series of events on the day of his selection which ended up catching ajewel thiefand burning the selection ticket. Following the fifth trial, just beforeMakoto's executioncan be completed,Alter Egosuddenly appears and is able to prevent Makoto from dying by opening up a door on the floor. He is then rescued by Kyoko, going on to defeat Junko herself and survive the whole ordeal. Makoto's luck also comes into play during the events of the Final Killing Game, saving him from multiple dangerous situations. While his luck isn't nearly as powerful as hispredecessor'sorIzuru Kamukura's, his luck pattern is different from those two, and is difficult for Junko to analyze and predict. Thus, Junko predicted that he could possibly ruin her perfect layout plan, which ironically also made Junko allow him to live for the Killing School Life. Makoto discovers his true talent as the Ultimate Hope during the sixth and final trial of the Killing School Life. Interestingly, unlike most other talents, Makoto being the Ultimate Hope isn't recognized by Hope's Peak Academy, but rather earned for defeating Junko, the True Ultimate Despair. UnlikeIzuru Kamukura, who's Ultimate Hope comes from him being the embodiment of talent, Makoto's Ultimate Hope comes from his unusual amount of optimism and determination, which Makoto even comments on. As the Ultimate Hope, Makoto proves to have an immunity to Junko's tactics, built to make people fall into despair. Combined with his luck being difficult for Junko to analyze, causes her to leave him alive because defying her would be full of despair in its own right. Ultimately, Makoto’s talent aided him in defeating her by fillingtheotherfiveremainingparticipantswith hope, after they fell into despair over finding out aboutthe state of the world they were in. Makoto is also able to convince others to act with hope simply by spreading his hope to them. When the surviving members of the game are filled with hope, they were persuaded to choose to leave the academy and go out and see what the world had in store for them. In addition, inDanganronpa IF, Makoto unwittingly convincedMukuro Ikusaba, one of the Despair Sisters, to think of the world outside of Junko's plans to spread despair all over it. Makoto has even been encouraged by his own hope multiple times, thanks to his friends. After finding out thatKazuo Tenganhas been murdered byKyosuke Munakata, Makoto begins to break down over the fact that he’s been unable to stop people from killing each other. However, Aoi, along withMiaya Gekkogahara, were able to cheer him up, saying that he has given them hope and that they're willing to shoulder his burden. Later, Kyoko tells Makoto that he shouldn't give up on hope, and that she'll always be there for him if his power doesn’t prove to be enough. After her apparent death, Makoto was able to use his and Kyoko's hope in order to convince Kyosuke to join him and combine their hopes together. Makoto believes that hope is infectious. True to his words, Makoto's effort in defeating Junko, protecting the Remnants of Despair in the Neo World Program, and his firm ideals and optimism eventually become fruitful as he could overcome all despairs at the end of his adventure in Hope's Peak Series."
How did Makoto feel about the game of rock-paper-scissors?,"he felt that he might as well do something different in this case as well. Plus - there were about 10 people in the group. He didn't think losing was a big possibility. Yet he lost on the first round. Everyone except for him put out rock, while he played scissors. His friends were astonished at just how unlucky Makoto was, but sent him off to the convenience store to buy them snacks and drinks regardless.",Makoto naegi secret file,"The day when Makoto was selected to attend Hope's Peak Academy seemed like an ordinary day at first. Makoto was going home from school and he was in a cheery mood thanks to the clear weather. He had a feeling that something good might happen to him. One thought occurred to him - maybe he should take the long way home. He thought about doing something different than usual. Makoto passed by a park, and saw a group of his friends trying to decide who to send to the convenience store in a game of rock-paper-scissors. They invited Makoto to join the game, and although Makoto would've usually refused it , he felt that he might as well do something different in this case as well. Plus - there were about 10 people in the group. He didn't think losing was a big possibility. Yet he lost on the first round. Everyone except for him put out rock, while he played scissors. His friends were astonished at just how unlucky Makoto was, but sent him off to the convenience store to buy them snacks and drinks regardless. Ten minutes later, Makoto was struggling with the two heavy bags filled with the stuff he got from the convenience store. He tried to distract himself by thinking of the music show that'll be on TV tonight - featuring Sayaka Maizono. Yet as his mood began to improve, misfortune struck again. Both of the plastic bags tore open at the same time, spilling their contents all across the pavement. A few minutes passed and Makoto finished collecting all the cans and bags, but wondered for a moment, as he felt like the stuff he managed to gather was less than what he had started out with. He looked around and spotted an old man sitting on the bench. The old man slowly bent down and picked up a can of coffee that rolled to a stop at his feet, opened it up and drank it. That can of coffee belonged to Makoto - yet the old man said he felt that it was natural to drink it since it ended up right in front of him. Makoto was flabbergasted at this incredulous excuse, and revealed to the old man that he seemed to be having a very unlucky day, complaining that he didn't do anything bad enough to deserve this streak of misfortune. The old man laughed and told Makoto that he didn't believe in karma at all. He'd seen plenty of evil people be blessed with fortune, and plenty of kind people suffer all sorts of misfortune. In the end, he says, luck isn't something that a man can control, no matter how much talent one has or how hard one works. He suggests for Makoto to just accept things the way they are. After finishing their conversation, the old man returned the half-empty can of coffee back to Makoto and left, yet Makoto noticed that the old man had left his phone on the bench. He called out to the old man, who was already a distance away, but the old man seemed deaf to his calls. Makoto was conflicted - should he just ignore the phone and bring the snacks to the park, or should he leave those snacks and chase after the old man? He eventually decided on the latter, and rushed after the old man. His calls were once again drowned out - this time by the sound of a bus coming to a stop ahead. The old man immediately took off towards the bus station - Makoto panicked slightly and upped his own pace as well, and managed to hop into the bus after the old man in the nick of time. Makoto found the old man sitting in the back, and just as he was about to head there, his legs wobbled from the intense running and he lost his balance. Just before he crashed to the ground, he instinctively grabbed onto something. He heard the sound of something tearing and fell to the ground regardless. Makoto's sole consolation was that he managed to soften his fall somewhat by grabbing onto the mysterious object, but even that turned out to be simply a continuation of his misfortune. Makoto happened to tear open a bag, from which spilled dozens of precious jewelry. The owner of the bag, someone looking like your average salaryman, immediately took out a knife and demanded everyone to freeze. The man was namedJutarō Akafuku. He was a robber who had been blessed with fortune for as long as he was alive. He was just done robbing a small jewelry shop and it all went smoothly, until he was involved in Makoto's misfortune, which could not be overcome even with his unnatural luck. Makoto experienced a minor breakdown thanks to the series of incredibly unlucky events. And to think it all started from him taking a long way home - he couldn't even wrap his head around everything. Correctly identifying Makoto as the cause of his recent misfortune, Jutarō decided to take him hostage and got the driver out of his seat by threatening to slit Makoto's throat if he didn't comply. Jutarō sat Makoto down in the driver's seat and used him as a hostage. In the meanwhile, he ordered the passengers in the bus to gather the scattered pieces of jewelry for him, promising their safety if they cooperated. However, just as someone finished gathering all the pieces, the old man, who had been faking sleep up till that point, sprang up and tackled Jutarō, pinning him on the ground. The old man was a kendo master. At that precise instant, one thought ran through Makoto's mind particularly strongly - he must save the old man. Makoto feels willing to fight, but that was all for naught as the bus suddenly accelerated - Makoto had accidentally shifted the gears and stepped on the gas pedal. The bus lurched forward, throwing both Makoto and the old man off balance. The old man yelled at Makoto to step on the brakes, which Makoto did immediately, putting the bus to an abrupt stop that knocked him off balance once again. As Makoto was regaining his balance, his hand accidentally brushed over a button. It was a button to open the bus's door. Jutaro saw this as an opportunity and immediately hightailed it out of the bus. The old man was writhing on the ground in pain and shouted at Makoto to chase after the robber. Makoto couldn't believe that he'd ask someone of his stature to chase after a grown man - and capture him, no less. But for some reason, the entire bus seemed to be in agreement. Makoto sought out the bus driver for assistance - surely he would point out how ridiculous this situation was - but found the bus driver passed out. Left with no choice, Makoto jumped out of the bus, only to crash into a postman who took note of the bus's erratic movements and came over to check. Both of them fell over - Makoto lamenting his bad luck again before noticing Jutarō riding the motorcycle that once belonged to the postman. Jutarō threatened Makoto by saying that he'd hate him for the rest of his life if he ended up being arrested. Jutarō started the engine and accelerated, believing that he could escape successfully. The postman shouted at him, and Makoto simply stood there unmoving. He was tired of the streak of misfortune that seemed to follow him at every step and decided to give up and do nothing. He just wanted to go back to his normal daily life as an ordinary high school student. At that moment, the motorcycle that Jutarō was riding tipped over and threw the man across the street. The motorcycle spun wildly and hit a streetlamp before exploding in a shower of sparks and smoke, burning up the bag of letters that the postman had put on it. Makoto walked towards the accident site, unable to believe his eyes. What he found was a bent and broken can of juice - the cause for the motorcycle overturning, and one of that cans that Makoto accidentally spilled all over the streets just a while ago, and one that he wasn't able to locate when he searched for missing cans. It was a series of impossible coincidences caused by Makoto's bad luck. And this situation was merely a result of Makoto's overwhelmingly bad luck managing to defeat Jutarō's careful planning and luck. It rendered all sorts of talent and hard work futile. The letter addressed to that year's Ultimate Lucky Student burnt up in the accident. Hope's Peak Academy's headmaster,Jin Kirigiri, decided to hold the lottery again because he felt that the misfortune of having her admission letter burnt up disqualified her from being accepted as Ultimate Lucky Student. In fact, he already got the results of the draw - Makoto Naegi. Meanwhile, Makoto was returning home after a long period of questioning by the police . He was dead tired, yet his nerves were still on the edge as he was wary of more unfortunate things happening to him on the taxi ride home. Fortunately, he arrived home rather smoothly - only to be greeted by enthusiastic Komaru, who told him that a letter from Hope's Peak Academy had arrived for him, accepting him as this year's Ultimate Lucky Student. Makoto was overjoyed - he felt like all the misfortune that he'd experienced in the day had been overturned by this news, but little did he know that he was wrong."
What is Ryoko Otonashi's first year at Hope's Peak Academy?,"During his first year at Hope's Peak Academy, Makoto found ane-Handbook Yasuke Matsudahad dropped.",Danganronpa zero,"During his first year at Hope's Peak Academy, Makoto found ane-HandbookYasuke Matsudahad dropped. When he went to the medical bay to return it, he bumped intoRyoko Otonashi, who asked him where Yasuke is. Makoto answered that the Ultimate Neurologist was probably out before trying to comfort Ryoko when she launched into a rant of frustration. Both students were confused by each other; Ryoko suspected Makoto of being a pervert behind his friendly demeanor, while Makoto found Ryoko to be a bit familiar. He introduced himself, explained what he came to do, and tentatively told Ryoko about a rumor regarding a student who has become forgetful. Hearing that, Ryoko continues to ask persistently if he used to know her, until he finally admits he did. Suddenly,Misshiki Madaraiappeared, grabbing Makoto's shoulders. He claims to be immortal and a survivor of the student council, looking for revenge for the student council as well as his own pride, willing to do anything. As the other two talk, Makoto is completely silent and terrified. Madarai then turns expressionless, as he remembers Makoto. He asks his name and seems to threaten him, and the other boy is very afraid. Madarai tells Ryoko that Makoto's head will be crushed in an ""unfortunate accident"" if she doesn't obey him and tell him what he wants. Madarai looks at her with intimidating eyes while Makoto pleads to her silently. Ryoko then calms down as she begins to mumble her usual mantra, that it has nothing to do with her. Both boys are confused by her words, and she simply answers that Makoto is unlucky, like he himself mentioned before. To prove his point, Madarai is about to kill Makoto, but suddenly his classmate Mukuro appears and saves him by attacking Madarai. Very relieved, Makoto thanks the girl, and she answers that she was simply helping her classmate and happened to pass by. Makoto continues his sincere thanks, much to Mukuro's embarrassment. Makoto thinks he's lucky because Mukuro happened to pass by. After an awkward silence, Mukuro notices someone was hiding close by, and it turns out to beYuto Kamishiro. He claims Ryoko is his client and he asks her to come with him. When Makoto says they should do something about Madarai on the floor, Mukuro says she'll do it. Makoto is worried and thinks she shouldn't do it all by herself. Yuto agrees they shouldn't tell the security department about it, as he and Ryoko are busy with their case. Yuto is angered by Makoto's hesitation and leaves with Ryoko in a hurry. As they leave, Makoto looks at Ryoko with determined eyes and Ryoko feels uneasy as she can suddenly feel an incredible aura coming from him. It is Ultimate level of hope, though she doesn't realize it and in a few minutes, she completely forgets his existence."
How long did it take Jin and the rest of the class to seal the school building?,a year,During the tragedy,"Makoto lived in the Academy happily, spending his happy times together for around one year untilThe Tragedyoccurred. During The Tragedy, Jin planned to seal the school building and let the students live forever inside the Academy in order to protect them from the destruction. His plan was agreed by Makoto and the rest of the class, and they sealed the building together and lived peacefully inside it for a year without knowing that the Ultimate Despair members were already in their midst.

How did Komaru and Toko defeat Jataro Kemuri?,contacted Future Foundation on top of Towa Tower,Danganronpa another episode: ultra despair girls,"Makoto was seen in the end of chapter 2 after Komaru and Toko succeeded in contacting Future Foundation on top of Towa Tower. Komaru and Toko contacted Future Foundation after they defeatJataro Kemuri, one of theWarriors of Hope's main members. Makoto is the one who responds to the device, surprising Komaru. She asked about their parents' condition, but Makoto didn't know about their current situation and where were they. Makoto explained that he joined the Future Foundation, and was surprised that Komaru was with Toko who had suddenly disappeared. It was revealed that Toko went to rescue Byakuya without any orders from Future Foundation. Komaru who realized that both Makoto and Toko already knew each other, and she wondered why Toko didn't tell her anything. Makoto was glad that his sister was with Toko, but Toko was mainly concerned with Byakuya being put in danger. Makoto later explained to Komaru about his, Toko's and Byakuya's time trapped in the Killing Game at Hope's Peak Academy, and how all three of them had joined Future Foundation. Makoto's explanation awed Komaru who lauded the survivors for fighting and moving forward unlike herself. Makoto ended up on the receiving end of Toko's jab about him becoming Ultimate Hope and pulling everyone together. Komaru remarked on Makoto's growth, saying that Makoto had become more mature and reliable than he used to be. Makoto apologized to Komaru about her imprisonment, explaining that she, like othercaptiveswho were related to Class 78th, were used as motives for Class 78th's students to turn against each other. He also explained that after a long period of fruitless searching for the captives, they had received an anonymous tip only days prior, told that Captives from the Killing Game were being held in an apartment tower inTowa City. He explained that that was the reason Byakuya mounted the rescue mission in Towa City, not expecting that Towa City would simultaneously collapse into chaos and for Byakuya to end up missing. Makoto was alarmed when Junko Enoshima's name was mentioned by Toko in reference to the girls running into the Warriors of Hope; the Warriors were catching, releasing, and then hunting Captives bound to wristbands they made, that self-destruct when their wearers exit Towa City, and that Byakuya's capture was a deliberate trap set by the Remnants of Despair to lure the Future Foundation into action at Towa City. Makoto believed that Junko had foreseen this desperate situation from the very beginning. Toko forbids Makoto from rescuing Komaru as it would put Byakuya in danger and declares if he came, she would take Komaru's life.

Makoto was contacted by Byakuya, who proceeded to explain that Komaru has chosen to remain in Towa City of her own volition, then watched a handheld recording on Byakuya's device of Komaru explaining her reasons for remaining in Towa City . He remarked that Komaru had surprised him before and that he resolved to intervene directly in similarly drastic situations; this remark served as a retrospective explanation for Makoto trying to save the Remnants of Despair inDanganronpa 2."
How many operatives did Byakuya send as an escort to help Makoto break through the rescue squad blockade?,half,Hope arc- the academy of hope and students of despair,"Makoto continued to the broadcasting studio where Ryota was situated, Byakuya sending half of his operatives as an escort to help Makoto break through the rescue squad blockade. They began to fire bullets rapidly, causing Makoto and Byakuya's operatives to take cover below a concrete wall. After their plan of action seemed to be halted, Nagito caused a rock slide of boulders from above, quashing the efforts of the rescue squad. Makoto is shocked to discover Nagito is the one to carry out this action. Makoto made his way to the entrance of the broadcasting studio, finding that the Class 77-B have already arrived, he waited outside, listening intently. The Class 77-B are able to convince Ryota to discontinue his intent and allowed him come to the realization that his actions were not creating hope. Makoto, no longer needing to get involved in the situation, proceeded down the sloping platform. Stopping further down, he watched on at the breaking sunlight approaching through the skyline. The Class 77-B left the broadcasting studio and continued down the sloping platform, Hajime nodding gratefully at Makoto with respect, responding Makoto to also nod in return.

Makoto then proclaimed that every day is a step forward in a world filled with hope and despair, he began to reminisce about Kyoko, staring at her blood upon his hand. Surprisingly she left the building alive, having been recovered by Mikan from a near-death state, Makoto turned around in surprise. Several months after the Final Killing Game, Makoto and the Future Foundation decided to rebuild Hope's Peak Academy, with him becoming the principal and working alongside Kyoko."

Makoto was cosplayed several times in the last trial byTsumugi Shirogane, the mastermind of theKilling School Semester. But somehow, Makoto and the Hope's Peak Academy's existence being mere fiction were possibly lies that Tsumugi made up, as pointed out byShuichiat the epilogue, hinting that Makoto, his classmates, and Hope's Peak Academy's existence were real, because they're fictional but their lives are as real as Shuichi, Maki, and Himiko's lives are.

What did Sayaka do after receiving the alarming video which showed her friends disbanding the idol group and laying on the stage in distress?,she always meant to talk to Makoto since witnessing him nursing an injured crane back to health after it got lost and stuck in the pool at their school,Sayaka maizono,"Prior to entering Hope's Peak Academy, Makoto and Sayaka attended middle school together and didn't have much of a friendship due to them being in different social standards. Sayaka later reveals that she always meant to talk to Makoto since witnessing him nursing an injured crane back to health after it got lost and stuck in the pool at their school. They ended up graduating without ever having contact. It's heavily implied that Makoto had a crush on Sayaka since middle school. This appears to be a bit naive first crush, as he doesn't actually know her at that point, but admires her from afar. He thinks Sayaka is very beautiful and, based onMakoto Naegi Secret File, he enjoyed watching her performances after she became an idol. After meeting with each other in high school, they seem to have become close friends, and are seen talking together inDanganronpa 3 - Despair Arc. Also, in one of their high school pictures, Makoto seems to be looking at Sayaka while their class was out swimming. During the Killing School Life, Sayaka recognized Makoto immediately and befriended him. A mutual attraction formed between the two and she even considered herself to be his ""assistant."" He admired her very much and silently remarked on her beauty every time she smiled. They trusted one another, and she admitted to him that she would go to dangerous lengths so she can protect and defend her idol members. After receiving the alarming video which showed her friends disbanding the idol group and laying on the stage in distress, Sayaka had an emotional breakdown. Makoto was quick to comfort her, promising to get her out of the school no matter what it took. Makoto cared for her enough to let her borrow his room when she was scared of sleeping in her own. The next morning, Makoto goes looking for her, worried about the condition she was in. Upon finding her dead in his bathroom, he was devastated, letting out a loud scream and fainting in shock. After finding out the facts from the class trial, and knowing that Sayaka took advantage of his caring actions and tried to frame him, Makoto feels betrayed; however, he still mourns over her death as she was his close friend. Kyoko comforts Makoto and tells him that it's most likely Sayaka wrote her dying message with Makoto in her thoughts, exposing her killer to apologize for her actions. Makoto points out that she also could have just wanted to get back onher killer. It is not revealed whether that is true or not, but in his conversation with Kyoko after the trial, he quotes Sayaka, calling his intuition a result of him being a psychic and then denying it as a joke after. In the second game, Makoto used the 11037 number as a code to save the remaining students, the number which Sayaka used to save Makoto from being framed as the culprit in the first trial, Makoto later explained to Hajime the reason he set 11037 as the code because a certain person left that number behind to save him from trouble, proving that Makoto believed Kyoko's theory and remembered her dearly as a friend. This is most likely due to the fact that Makoto regained his memories, and remembered his relationship with Sayaka. In the anime version of the first game, Makoto is often seen blushing in Sayaka's company and the relationship chart confirms his crush on her. However, the chart does not mention her liking him back, while it's been implied that she does. InDanganronpa 3 - Future Arc, Sayaka's ""ghost"" appeared to Makoto alongside Kyoko's ""ghost,"" after he was brainwashed and about to commit suicide. According to Sayaka's voice actress, her appearance was supposed to represent ""a guy thinking of his first love right before his death,"" and thus she was not portrayed with a scary voice. InDanganronpa IF,when Makoto starts recovering his memories, he thinks that above all, he must protect Sayaka. When he gets sick, Sayaka drops her canon plan to frame him and spends the whole night nursing him instead. She's also show to feel guilty about considering her betrayal. It's also noted that when Makoto was stabbed protecting Mukuro, Sayaka was the first one to scream. InDanganronpa V3bonus modeUltimate Talent Development Plan, Sayaka cooks a dish for Makoto, which he enjoys. They then talk about the old days and want to spend more time together."
What does Makoto do during the Final Killing Game?,remains with Aoi,Aoi asahina,"Although not sharing any kind of close relationship with Aoi when they first met, Makoto becomes close friends with her during their time together at Hope's Peak. During one of her Free Time events, Aoi requests that Makoto act as her fake boyfriend so she can practice when she gets a real one. Their closeness is also shown when Aoi is shown feeling guilty over having executed Makoto and she seems happy when he forgives her. As members of the Future Foundation, the two have grown considerably closer. Makoto makes sure Aoi doesn't overdo things while Aoi frequently tells him that everything is okay. When Makoto is arrested for betraying the Future Foundation, Aoi helps defend him, and she also helps him escape from Kyosuke when the latter tries to kill him. Makoto gives Aoi hope after she despairs at the fact that they must start a new round of killing. Makoto remains with Aoi throughout most of the Final Killing Game, and she helps him escape from Kyosuke and Juzo numerous times. Makoto constantly relies on Aoi, and is thankful for the help she has given him. Despite this, Makoto worries for her safety, particularly when she attempts to fight Juzo despite being at a disadvantage due to her NG code. Makoto and Aoi have been shown to understand one another when deaths or murders occur, even since the Killing School Life. Makoto's understanding of Aoi's emotional side is ultimately what allowed him to thwart her plans to have them executed in Chapter 4. During the Final Killing Game, when Kyoko supposedly dies, Aoi fears that Makoto would become reckless and hurt himself, despite Makoto assuring her that he wouldn't let their friend's sacrifice go to waste. The two also comfort each other when these events occur. When Kazuo is murdered by Kyosuke, Aoi gives Makoto support and gives him hope just as he did her. After his conversation with Komaru, Makoto realizes that they may have reminded Aoi of her deceased brother, Yuta, who was Aoi's Captive and thus the person closest to her prior to The Tragedy. He appeared to want to comfort his friend, however he was unable to do so as they were interrupted by Miaya revealing her robotic nature. During the Final Killing Game, some of Aoi's expressions indicate that she knows Makoto and Kyoko like each other, and she appears silently very happy for them. After the events of The Tragedy have been resolved, Makoto, Aoi, and their fellow survivors decide to rebuild Hope's Peak Academy together."
What did Byakuya use Makoto to try to find out the mentality of the 99%?,"He offered him a $550,000 salary, as a part of a test to understand and see if his belief of being happy with what he had was true or not",Byakuya togami,"Makoto thought of Byakuya's talent as exceptional, due to his status as the Ultimate Affluent Prodigy. Byakuya often acted coldly towards Makoto, starting at their introductions, similarly to everyone else, which Makoto disliked, albeit not openly. Despite this, Makoto acted friendly to Byakuya, similarly to everyone else, keeping his negative comments to himself. During Byakuya's Free Time events, when Makoto explained his talent to Byakuya, he thought of Makoto as a boring commoner, something which Makoto saw as going too far. Makoto tried to understand Byakuya, and he realized that that they were worlds apart. He tried, unsuccessfully, to teach Byakuya that living a normal life was alright with him. Similarly, Byakuya used Makoto to try to find out the mentality of the 99%. He offered him a $550,000 salary, as a part of a test to understand and see if his belief of being happy with what he had was true or not, and was surprised when he rejected it, but said the thought of Makoto being his secretary made him feel ill. In the end, Byakuya disliked Makoto's philosophy, but was willing to talk to him about his past, but stated they would never be friends. Makoto realized they were worlds apart, but began to understand him. During Chapter 2, Byakuya assisted Makoto with finding evidence for the murder of Chihiro, though it was later revealed that it was used for Byakuya's entertainment and to help figure out who was a threat to Byakuya's plans, to which Byakuya identified Makoto as. In Chapter 5, after Byakuya resolved to defeat themastermind, he became less cold towards Makoto, such as being more willing to give him information and warning him about the dangers of protecting Kyoko during the fifth trial. During the final class trial, Makoto helped rescue Byakuya from Junko's despair. Although Byakuya states he didn't need Makoto's encouragement, he was most likely lying. InDanganronpa 2, Byakuya cooperated with Makoto's plan, agreeing to rescue the Remnants of Despair and Byakuya respected Makoto's decision. InDanganronpa Another Episode, Byakuya says to Komaru, that she reminds him of Makoto when Byakuya first met Makoto, indicating Byakuya respects Makoto more after the events of Danganronpa. InDanganronpa 3, Byakuya tells Makoto that he ""was as tough as a cockroach, and as hard to kill,"" and that he wouldn't want them to be enemies. Aoi suggested that Byakuya was trying to make Makoto feel better, as the latter was thrown into another killing game."
Who does Makoto ask to be their witness in order to have a fair contest showing that he now may trust Makoto more after the events of the first class trial in which his innocence was proved?,Mondo,Mondo owada,"Byakuya provoked Mondo to become enraged, Makoto tried to stop Mondo from doing something rash and ended up being punched by Mondo when trying to intervene. Mondo later apologized for his short-tempered actions showing he holds no disdain towards Makoto. When Sayaka was murdered, Mondo assumed Makoto to be the killer due to the murder happening in his dorm room without considering other evidence, showing he did not fully trust Makoto by this point. Mondo and Kiyotaka have an argument about who has the greater strength and challenge each other to an endurance contest in the sauna. Mondo requests Makoto to be their witness in order to have a fair contest showing that he now may trust Makoto more after the events of the first class trial in which his innocence was proved. During Mondo's Free Time events he requested Makoto come riding with his gang after they escape Hope's Peak Academy. Makoto is unsure if it would be safe and Mondo stated Makoto could ride with him on his motorcycle, showing that he trusts Makoto and sees him as a close friend. Mondo also talks to Makoto exclusively about his indecisiveness over his career path, something that he stated he would share with no one else which presents the development of their friendship. In Chihiro's final free time event, Makoto recommended Mondo as his trainer. Makoto is able to discover Mondo to be the culprit of Chihiro's murder and upon hearing Mondo's reasons for killing Chihiro, Makoto started to feel guilty and was deeply upset when Mondo is sentenced to be executed."
What game did Junko Enoshima participate in?,Mutual Killing Game,Junko enoshima,"As the Ultimate Hope, Makoto was a major enemy of Junko. In turn, she seems to be one of the few people he genuinely dislikes, as he's usually very kind and forgiving. In turn, Junko thinks out of all the students in Class 78th, Makoto seems to be the most annoying and odd person in her class. They developed a great hatred for each other during the Mutual Killing Game. In the end with the help of his friends, he had Junko Enoshima executed. However, even in her case, he felt that she didn't need to die and tried to reason with her when she was about to execute herself. Though dead, Junko has found ways to antagonize Makoto through her AI form. Besides his hatred for Junko, inDanganronpa IF,after he convinced Mukuro to think outside of Junko's world, he said that he would try to convince Junko in the same way as her sister, even after it's revealed that she's the mastermind of the Killing game."
What does Kyosuke think Makoto's words are hollow and meaningless?,"Makoto believes solely in hope, while Kyosuke believes in power",Kyosuke munakata,"Makoto is Kyosuke's most persistent obstacle in his desire to eliminate Ultimate Despair. Because of Kyosuke's position as vice-leader, he was successfully able to charge Makoto with treason against Future Foundation and continues to antagonize him. Rather than just punishing him, Kyosuke is in favor of executing Makoto alongside the Remnants of Despair. Contrary to what his actions might imply, Kyosuke admits to Makoto that he thinks he is impressive, and not just because he was responsible for the defeat of Junko Enoshima. Kyosuke respects Makoto's charisma and determination in the face of impossible odds; both qualities that were repeatedly displayed during the broadcast of the Killing School Life. Makoto implies that they had once been friends. Despite this, Kyosuke is consistently at odds with Makoto because their viewpoints are so different. Makoto believes solely in hope, while Kyosuke believes in power. Because of this, Kyosuke thinks that Makoto's words are hollow and meaningless, as he does not appreciate despair in the same way that he appreciates hope. In his view, Makoto's experience with the Killing Games pales in comparison to the Future Foundation's battle in a world with no laws or restrictions on the depths to which the forces of Despair can sink in order to snuff out hope. Kyosuke also fears how influential Makoto can be, as he doesn't want him convincing people that they can win against despair without fighting. Ultimately, Kyosuke's antagonism of Makoto is a clash of ideals on how best to reverse the damage wrought on the world by Ultimate Despair. Kyosuke also states that he'll eliminate despair at all cost, even if the despair itself was someone he dearly loved. However, Makoto managed to remind him to not forget about his beloved and Kyosuke began to change. He agreed to ally himself with Makoto, although he still seems somewhat wary of him despite Makoto trusting him completely."

D: Great Gozu.,A,Great gozu,"Great Gozu admires Makoto for his optimism in the face of adversity and has thought that way ever since seeing him broadcast in theKilling School Lifefor the first time.

How does Kyoko hide her feelings? A: She hides her feelings. B: She hides her feelings. C: She hides her feelings. D: She hides her feelings.,A,Personality,"Kyoko is a stoic, intelligent, and mysterious girl who tends to hide her feelings. She has a calm demeanor and tends to be completely unfazed by most of the events that occur, even at the sight of a dead body. At the beginning of the game, Kyoko often keeps her distance from the other students while investigating. Prior to the investigation to find the way out with no casualties, Kyoko doesn't seem to cooperate with the other students and does most of the investigating by herself. She plays major roles in solving mysteries of the culprits inClass Trialsand is also one of very few students that see things objectively and doesn't jump to conclusions in the trial, making her a valuable ally to Makoto. Kyoko is very very sensitive regarding the subject about the Hope's Peak Academy's headmaster , going as far as to even lose her cool and react with anger whenAlter Egomentioned the possibility of him being the mastermind. She also doesn't like it when people keep secrets from her, as Makoto finds out. Behind Kyoko's stone-cold personality, she seems to easily get emotionally upset, which is masked by her strong will. Even under calm situations, she sometimes lets her emotions get the best of her as shown when Alter Ego mentions her father, the former headmaster, and when Makoto refuses to tell her aboutSakura Ogami's odd rivalry withMonokuma. Furthermore, there are some moments that cause her to be visibly surprised, and she also blushes at Makoto during some rare situations. She appears to grow fond of him during the game, as she does show him her hands, after explaining that she only shows them to people she considers her family. During her Free Time Events, Kyoko says that her emotions work fine but she deliberately hides them to make herself really hard to read, but also to give others a calm and composed person to lean on. As seen inDanganronpa 3, Kyoko has changed quite a bit, withKazutaka Kodakaconsidering her development one of his favorite parts in the anime.[11]She has become a lot more considerate of her friends and her demeanor is friendlier in their company. She is seen smiling at them and sharing physical contact, like hugging and holding hands , and she trusts her friends very much. When she's with anyone but them, though, she's still very expressionless and reserved. She is also a bit sharp and annoyed inKoichi Kizakura's company. Being his boss, she is very protective of Makoto but also admires him greatly. InDanganronpa Kirigiri, it is revealed that many of Kyoko's emotional issues are caused by the way hergrandfatherraised her according to the strict family traditions. The family tradition is to take no sides in order to remain as neutral as possible, because the truth has no bias, though this tradition started during a time when being a detective was a more sacred occupation. Fuhito also refused to let Kyoko see her dying mother and even appeared to encourage Kyoko to dislike her father, as he believed that detective work comes before anything else, even a death of a family member. Notably, this was the one family tradition Kyoko didn't fully agree with. Fuhito enforced the idea that her entire sense of self is wrapped up in being a detective, giving the young girl some identity issues. He was also strictly overprotective of her, ordering her to not move outside after dark, forbid her from having a cell phone, and always wanted to know what she is doing."
"What was Kyoko's mother's last memory of being ""a white face floating above a hospital bed""?","Kyoko's last memories of her being ""a white face floating above a hospital bed""",Childhood,"Kyoko comes from a family of famous detectives. Her father, Jin Kirigiri, wasn't interested in being a detective, and he was kicked out of the family by his father Fuhito Kirigiri before Kyoko was even born. Some time afterward, Jin married a woman from Uzuchi family and they had Kyoko. It appears that when she was very young, she and her father spent some time with Jin's close friendKoichi Kizakura. After learning about her existence, Fuhito invited Jin back to the family solely because he wanted to make the girl his heir. He began strict training to make Kyoko a true detective, though Jin still very much disliked his father. When Kyoko was only 7 years old, her mother turned ill and was hospitalized when Kyoko and Fuhito were doing detective work abroad. Jin tried to contact them, but Fuhito refused to aid his family and didn't even let Kyoko see her dying mother, because to Fuhito being a detective was more important than anything else. Kyoko's mother then died, with Kyoko's last memories of her being ""a white face floating above a hospital bed"". Absolutely furious with his father, Jin left the family, and Fuhito encouraged Kyoko to hate him by claiming that Jin only used her mother's death as an excuse to leave the family and pursue his own dreams. Kyoko became very close to her grandfather, Fuhito, who raised her and taught her all she currently knows in the detective business, and he protected her from anything he deemed a threat. However, Fuhito was also shown to be extremely strict in his wish to make Kyoko a perfect heir and a detective, even causing the young girl some emotional issues as Fuhito wanted her to be a detective above everything else."
Where does Kyoko find Ryoko Otonashi?,Hope's Peak Academy,Danganronpa zero,"While attending Hope's Peak, Kyoko did investigations for her father and the Hope's Peak AcademySteering Committee. She tried to investigateIzuru KamukuraandThe Tragedy of Hope's Peak Academy. One night, a month after the incident, she plans on meeting one of the Steering Committee's members on the school's eastern quarter's courtyard to ask him questions directly. When she first contacted the man, he coldly refused to meet her, insisting that it wasn’t necessary. But once she'd procured documents concerning shady deals in his past, she found him much more open to the suggestion. The man is late for a few minutes. As he is annoyingly about to ask why Kyoko called him, he is suddenly crushed and hit directly on the head by a falling school desk, killing him. Then, several more desks fall down, hiding the body. Kyoko notices a human figure standing atop the school building. It was Mukuro Ikusaba disguised as Junko, though Kyoko cannot tell. She tries to target Kyoko as well, but she avoids the attack and goes inside the building. She can't find the culprit and soon the body disappears as well. She decides to call her father and then goes to see him to tell him what happened. They talk about Izuru Kamukura and she tells her father to warn the Steering Committee. As Kyoko leaves, Jin tells her to be careful. Kyoko entersYasuke Matsuda's Neuroscience Laboratory, looking for him. However, she only findsRyoko Otonashisleeping on the bed. She understands she is the amnesiac person of the rumors who have received treatment in the lab. Kyoko investigates the room and finds a hidden storage space under the bed. She finds clothes that belonged to a deceased Steering Committee member, and she immediately understands that Yasuke is connected to the murders. She is also suspicious of him considering the murder ofSōshun Murasame. Kyoko's investigation is interrupted when Ryoko wakes up on the bed above her. Ryoko hears the detective under the bed, assuming that she is Yasuke. Kyoko gets up and mentions that the rumors seem to be true. Ryoko doesn't understand what she means and Kyoko clarifies that Ryoko must be the amnesiac who has been having treatments. Kyoko introduces herself and when she mentions Yasuke, Ryoko asks her where he is, but she doesn't know. Kyoko says she is looking for Yasuke as well, as she needs some information. Since Ryoko assumed Kyoko was Yasuke at first, the detective asks if he has a habit of being under the bed. Ryoko answers honestly that Yasuke told her it helps him concentrate when he is frustrated, but Kyoko says this is certainly a lie. She shows Ryoko that the bed is actually hiding a secret room. She tells Ryoko that she believes Yasuke is involved in the murder of the Steering Committee members. Ryoko tells her he would never kill anyone, but Kyoko answers she said he was involved, not that he has murdered. She then mentions the murder of Soshun Muramase, which was disguised as a suicide. Kyoko says that most likely Yasuke murdered Soshun. Hearing this makes Ryoko feel intense anxiety and she doesn't understand anything anymore. Ryoko starts to scream that it has nothing to do with her. Suddenly, one of theYosshiki Madaraibreaks through the door. The fourth brother Yosshiki confronts Ryoko and Kyoko in Yasuke's lab. Ryoko is confused about how many times she's seen Madarai get beaten up, and Yosshiki claims once again that he, ""Isshiki"", is immortal. However, Kyoko calls out that Isshiki Madarai's ""immortality"" is apparently just a ruse, much to Yosshiki's surprise. The Brothers then choose to reveal their secret when the fifth BrotherSasshikiappears. Kyoko speaks of how the Madarai Brothers really look just like one, and the sixth BrotherRosshikisoon appears to outnumber and beat up Ryoko and Kyoko. Ryoko is pushed out of the lab into the hallway and she is pursued by four of the Brothers, with Rosshiki remained behind in a fight with Kyoko. After Mukuro helps Ryoko, she goes to help Kyoko and kills the last brother."
How long did it take Kyoko and the rest of the class to seal the school building?,a year,During the tragedy,"Kyoko lived in the Academy for around one year until The Tragedy occurred. During The Tragedy, Jin planned to seal the school building and let the students live in the Academy forever in order to protect them from the destruction. Kyoko and the rest of the class agreed to his plan, and they sealed the building together and lived peacefully inside it for a year without knowing that the Ultimate Despair members were already in their midst. The true Ultimate Despair took away the Class 78th's school memories so they could participate in the Killing School Life. Unlike the others, Kyoko forgot her talent."
What did Kyoko reveal about herself?,a map of Hope's Peak Academy,Danganronpa: trigger happy havoc,"When Makoto attempted to introduce himself to Kyoko and asked her name, she was very secretive. She didn't reveal her talent, questioning why she should tell him. After Makoto stated she didn't have to reveal anything about herself, she said she won't, thus ending the conversation. Later, whenMondo Owadathreatened Monokuma in the gymnasium, Kyoko was the only one who realized that the robotic, plush teddy bear was about to explode and told him to throw it. The Ultimate Biker Gang Leader promptly agreed to Kyoko's suggestion and threw Monokuma, who self-destructed mere moments after. Kyoko had effectively saved Mondo's life. On her first day of being trapped inside the school with her fellow classmates, and during everyone's initial investigation, Kyoko did not join the others in the dining hall until later than usual, much toKiyotaka Ishimaru's annoyance. However, everyone grew bewildered when she revealed to have found a map of the school. Kyoko stated that they were indeed locked up inside Hope's Peak Academy, but that it was different in terms of its construction and has had many odd renovations done to it. After Monokuma had presented the first motive to everyone, Kyoko asked him why he would do something like this and what his motive was. Monokuma simply replied with ""Despair. That's all"". AfterSayaka Maizonowas murdered and everyone checked the Monokuma File, Kyoko was one of the few students who did not immediately suspect Makoto. Kyoko investigated the scene of the crime, Makoto's room, and made many important discoveries such as his room being completely free of any hair, as well as the bathroom doorknob hanging off its hinges. When Makoto asked Kyoko about Sayaka's dying message, she told him that if he wanted to be completely convinced about the truth of this case, then he needed to solve the mystery himself, implying that she had already solved the mystery before anyone else had. During the class trial, Kyoko is the only student who defends Makoto despite all initial evidence of the crime pointing to him. With her assistance, Makoto was successfully able to prove his own innocence. Once everyone had gotten onto the topic of how the killer entered Makoto's room , Kyoko confirmed that Sayaka had lied about being scared and was actually trying to lure someone into the room with every intent to kill them. Makoto was quick to deny this claim, but with a notepad that Kyoko had discovered, she revealed that Sayaka had left a note asking someone to come to the room. Makoto was incredibly saddened to have found out that Sayaka took advantage of his trust and kindheartedness, but Kyoko reassured him and said that it would be over for all of them if they didn't figure out who the real culprit was. After Kyoko helped everyone deduce Sayaka's dying message, Makoto was able to hone in onLeon Kuwataas the true perpetrator. Despite all of the evidence presented, Leon continued to vehemently deny the claim until Makoto asked to see his toolkit. Kyoko strictly said to Leon that ""I lost it"" is not an excuse to prove his own innocence at this point. Leon was no longer able to refute and as such, was found guilty of killing The Ultimate Pop Sensation. When Makoto attempted to lunge at Monokuma for driving Sayaka and Leon to commit their crimes, Kyoko stopped him and said that if he wanted to make Sayaka's enemies pay for what they've done, then he should hold off for now. Makoto reluctantly complied and Leon was dragged off to hisexecution, Kyoko kept a composed face during it while everyone else watched in shock. After the trial had concluded, Kyoko talked to Makoto and tried to reassure him that even though it is an undeniable fact that Sayaka had betrayed him, it was still possible that her final moments were spent thinking of him due to her leaving her dying message. Makoto replied by saying it's impossible to know for sure and that she may have just been trying to get back at Leon for killing her, but Kyoko believed that deep down, she was uncertain about committing a crime and betraying her friend, calling it ironic. Kyoko went on to state that she believes that Makoto is the kind of person to push past these events and move on, becoming slightly surprised when he stated that he would carry Sayaka and Leon's deaths with him forever. Kyoko looked forward to seeing how he would continue, but then asked how he knew that she wanted to ask him about Sayaka. Makoto jokingly replied with ""I'm psychic"", stunning her a bit, before going on to say that he just had good intuition. After the first trial, Monokuma allowed the groups to explore the second floor after he removed the shutters. Kyoko and the others discovered a letter regarding what happening before the Killing School Life began. She also discovered a broken laptop, which was later repaired by Chihiro. Upon the trial, she was the second person who discovered that Chihiro is actually a male. Knowing this, Kyoko attempted to lure the killer, Mondo, to misspeak. Kyoko's plan succeeded, and finally, the students were able to deduce the killer. On the next day, after exploring the third floor, Aoi confessed that she discovered Chihiro's ghost- who was later revealed as Alter Ego. Kyoko was the person who told the students to keep Alter Ego's presence a secret since Alter Ego was left by his master, Chihiro, in the bath's locker room which has no surveillance cameras in it. She also forbade anyone to use Alter Ego for their personal gain. The next morning after Monokuma revealed his third incentive, to give a 10 billion yen cash to whoever manages to graduate, only Sakura, Aoi, Makoto and Kyoko herself attended the usual breakfast in the cafeteria. Feeling strange due toCelestia LudenbergandYasuhiro Hagakure's absence, they decided to split up to search for the others to avoid something bad that might happen. During their search, Kyoko suddenly disappeared when the groups manage to find all the students, includingKiyotaka IshimaruandHifumi Yamada's corpses. Later, Kyoko revealed that during her search, she found Hiro in 'Justice Robo' suit inside a locker in the pool, a costume that the students believed to be the culprit behind Kiyotaka and Hifumi's murder. Much later after the third trial, Kyoko is the person who was trusted by thekillerto keep the key for the locker that Alter Ego is in. After the trial ended and theculprit was executed, Makoto asked her where she disappeared to during the search of the missing students. And it's revealed that Kyoko found a secret room in the men's bathroom on the second floor which doesn't have any surveillance cameras inside it. Kyoko, along with Makoto and Aoi didn't receive a letter from Sakura to meet with her. Later, she and Makoto found Aoi screaming and reporting that she saw Sakura sitting silently inside the locked rec room on the third floor. With Makoto's help, they were able to break into the rec room. But it was too late, Kyoko confirmed that Sakura has already lost her life. Aoi, who was shocked by the fact that her best friend was murdered, decided to call up the others to come to the rec room, leaving Kyoko and Makoto, who already started their investigation. During the investigation, Kyoko found that the shattered Monokuma bottle behind Sakura's death site was heavier than a Monokuma bottle figure. Kyoko believed that Sakura was struck twice in the head based on her wounds, but strangely she and Makoto only found one Monokuma bottle figure. During the trial, Kyoko and Makoto deduced that Sakura committed suicide to stop the others from fighting. Kyoko then used Sakura's payback and snuck inside the Headmaster's room and stole Monokuma's key that can unlock every room in Hope's Peak Academy. From there, she was the first of the survivors to know aboutMukuro Ikusaba, the secret sixteenth student. Byakuya's suspicion regarding how Kyoko's Ultimate Talent was the only one left unknown had come to fruition to which she states 'she can't' answer because she had no memory at all of what she was. Byakuya didn't believe this was the truth and explained they should limit her options until she's willing to talk, by taking her room key. When he thought he had finally convinced her to talk, she handed him her room key with no hesitation, to Byakuya's shock. Kyoko realized that trying to explain her situation earlier would only lead to the same conclusion. Kyoko later rang Makoto's doorbell during the night and told him to come to the dressing room before rushing off, to which Makoto followed in pursuit. She revealed to him that she has stolen something precious from Monokuma and made sure to state this in a room without surveillance cameras. She explained she used Makoto as a decoy to draw Monokuma to the data center so she could enter the headmaster's room undetected and retrieve the key giving her access to every part of the school that was locked, she also discovered a file revealing Mukuro's existence within the school and concluding her to be the possible mastermind rather than the Headmaster, Jin Kirigiri, who she stated she is sure isn't the mastermind. Her reason for calling on Makoto's help is so he can distract Monokuma yet again so she can find out which door will open with the key she retrieved, he successfully achieved this. Upon meeting in the dining hall the next morning, they find Kyoko missing and Monokuma was unaware of her whereabouts either. Later that day, Makoto started feeling the effects of a fever and had a strange dream in his sleep but woke up to find a masked stranger, who we later find to be Junko trying to murder him however too heavy to move, he was powerless until Kyoko saved him from danger by fighting back and stood over him before he passed out again, he woke up believing it to be a dream. A body at the indoor garden on the 5th floor is discovered, and upon Toko triggering the explosion and making the body unrecognizable, with Kyoko missing during the investigation, it is presumed she may be the one dead. She later shows up just before the Class Trial begins and tells Makoto that she was searching the second-floor dorms where there were no surveillance cameras and that she took a brief look at the body before making her way to the elevator. During the Class Trial, the murder of Mukuro is pinned on Kyoko following evidence of a locker key that was hidden in her room is found, the exact key to a locker which contained blood-stained arrows bunched together used as a weapon to kill Mukuro. But Kyoko made a convincing lie that she couldn't enter her room with her room key because Byakuya had confiscated it. Makoto knew this was a lie because she told him about the key she had found which could open any door in the whole school but he chose not to say anything in order to protect Kyoko and took the blame when they accused him of planting the locker key during the investigation while he and Byakuya searched Kyoko's room. In a twist of fate Makoto ended up being the one to receive anexecutionwhen it was destined for Kyoko, she was choked up, for the first time revealing her frustration and sadness for letting Makoto down. After dealing with the upset, Kyoko stated to Byakuya that it was the mastermind who was on the back foot, not themselves. She later helped Makoto escape the garbage disposal room, providing him food and water and saying she was atoning for her mistakes for not helping him in the trial when she should've protected him. She then explained why she had to survive the Class Trial since she was the only one to lose her memories of her Ultimate Ability and purpose, the mastermind clearly removed them otherwise she'd interfere with their plan. She expresses how much she trusts Makoto but isn't used to seeking help from others, she then explains her Ultimate Talent and purpose which she's finally remembered, that she's the Ultimate Detective and she came to the school to find the headmaster, Jin, her father. She also explained that the mastermind had to use the trial to kill her because they had to follow their own school rules yet unconventionally tried to kill Makoto, but she states she can hear the God of Death and felt a sense of dread, noticed Makoto's attacker and gave pursuit, before hindering the attackers' actions. She then explains the Mastermind is the 'Other Ultimate Despair' and that that is their 'True enemy' at this point in time. Prior to Makoto's miraculous survival and return, Kyoko would begin her retaliation by demanding that Monokuma reopen the trial, to which he gave up and reluctantly agreed. She is then reunited with the other students while explaining on his behalf that the trial was restarted due to some circumstances . Throughout the course of the investigation, Kyoko learned that her father is no longer alive in the academy: his remains were put in a gift box by Monokuma in the secret room of the principal's bedroom. Even though she looked unaffected by this revelation, she was clearly shocked by the fact that her father, in fact, never forgot about her and that she was really dear to him, to the point that the password to access the secret room was Kyoko's name and that in that room there was a photo of a smiling Kyoko as a child with her father. Even though she is still upset with her father, she was shocked to the point where she asked Makoto to leave the room, since she needed to be alone for a while to 'collect' her feelings. As the true perpetrator was revealed as the real Junko Enoshima, Kyoko is shocked by her father's primary reason to cut his ties with her big family and his true motive to build the academy which made her remain silent for the first time. As Kyoko was motivated by Makoto's words that hope is still alive, Kyoko would rethink about the case which seemingly involved her late father's meaning, indicating that even though their hearts disconnected, she added that if she knew her father well, he would never allow her to sacrifice Makoto just to stay in the school. With her support to Makoto andByakuya Togami, the students forced Junko onto her knees, executing herself in a special punishment ; which resulted in her 'death' and the survivors were finally free from the strings of the sadistic game. Considering their torments are finally over, Kyoko wonders if Makoto's faith about hope would maintain pure after the gruesome journey. Before she bid her friends farewell, Kyoko wonders if leaving the school, which she wouldn't miss, would be for better or worst. With that, Kyoko is among the 6 survivors who survived the incident."
Who did Kyoko take Makoto inside the boarding room to attend his trial?,"Kyoko, Aoi, and Yasuhiro",Danganronpa 3: the end of hope's peak high school-future arc,"Kyoko appears inDanganronpa 3- Future Arc, along withMakoto,Aoi, andYasuhiro. Kyoko is the 14th Division's leader and is one of the few people allowed to attend Makoto's trial, thus she gets roped into the ""Final Killing Game."" Kyoko, Aoi, and Yasuhiro were waiting for Makoto's arrival on the Future Foundation's off-shore facility's rooftop. She took Makoto inside the boarding room to attend his trial. However,Kyosuke Munakataimmediately orderedJuzo Sakakurato handcuff Makoto without any discussion first. Kyoko began to patronize Juzo as he wounded Makoto and requested to Kyosuke to suspend his trial as he was not in a suitable state for questioning, which Kyosuke agreed to. Later, Kyoko and Aoi were in the bathroom together. Aoi was upset that they weren't permitted to visit Makoto, and Kyoko simply explained to her that the Future Foundation still suspected them as allies to protect and hide theRemnants of Despair. Kyoko told Aoi to stay away from her Division's problem, but Aoi insisted that she would help her friends in need, making Kyoko smile at her. As she got out of the bathroom, she encounteredRyota Mitaraiin the corridor who was hesitating to enter the boardroom since he was very late. Kyoko and Ryota returned to the boardroom. Soon after, the building was attacked by an unknown enemy. She asked Makoto about the situation and concluded that they had been locked up inside the facility. Kyoko and the others were unaware that a sleeping gas had been thrown inside the boarding room and rendered them to sleep for some time. When she awoke, she and the others found Monokuma bracelets already set up on their wrist. Monokuma, who has been resurrected, appeared on the monitor, announcing that he would make the Future Foundation's leaders kill each other. He began the Final Killing Game withChisa Yukizome's dead body falling from the ceiling. After Monokuma announced the Final Killing Game rules, Kyoko checked her NG Code and was quietly surprised by what was written there. WhenUsamiappeared onMiaya Gekkogahara's computer screen, she explained to Aoi that Miaya was one of the developers of the Neo World Program. Kyoko examined the boardroom’s door and found that the kunai thatSonosuke Izayoithrew to the door earlier was missing after they drugged to sleep. She was the first person who noticedDaisaku Bandaidying from the lethal poison injection from the bangle. To avoid the NG Code violation, Miaya suggested everyone reveal theirs but Kyoko told her that there might be some people that were prohibited to tell their own NG Code. When the situation heated up, Kyoko created a diversion using the fire extinguisher so that Makoto could escape from the room. Following her successful attempt, Kyoko went to hide withKazuo Tenganand Ryota somewhere inside the building. Kyoko awakened after the sleeping drug's effect wore off. She was a bit skeptical and suspicious of Kazuo's calmness despite the situation hanging around the facility. Kyoko pointed out that the fewer the participants, the higher chance to find the attacker as if they had no intention of winning. The rules are totally disadvantaging the attacker. Kyoko intended to investigate alone before Ryota wondered why Kyosuke wanted to kill Makoto. He wanted everyone to believe in each other to fight back Monokuma, but when Kyoko asked her to show him his NG Code he refused to show it. She also didn't want anyone to discover her NG Code, saying that it was difficult to trust each other in that situation. Kyoko speculated that the attacker probably incorporated their NG Codes into the rules in order to make everyone realize that. Kyoko was cut off by Makoto via the intercom. She smiled when Makoto revealed his NG Code to everyone. However, despite knowing Makoto's softness to his Future Foundation allies, Kyoko still worried about him. When Kyosuke went to finish off Makoto, his subordinate Juzo came to attack Kyoko and almost hit her with a chair but she managed to dodge it. Kazuo and Ryota stood up for Kyoko and tried to protect her from Juzo's attack. Juzo knocked Kazuo away by kicking him in the back of the head and went to attack Kyoko with the chair he had previously thrown. Ryota tried to stop him, but Juzo kicked Ryota into Kyoko, and he accidentally injured her ankle when he fell on her. After Kazuo managed to beat Juzo, the three of them tied him to the wall with two loose wires. Soon, she reunited with Aoi and Miaya. The two of them comforted Ryota who blamed himself for hurting Kyoko's legs a while ago. After hearing Kyosuke's announcement from the intercom to execute Makoto, Kyoko confirmed it as bait for their group. She wanted to negotiate with Kyosuke, but Kazuo offered to do the job. Kyoko decided to return to the boardroom to investigate Chisa and Daisaku's bodies and met with Koichi Kizakura who was already waiting for her. Hearing that he felt safe when he stayed around her, Kyoko slapped Koichi's hands and didn't let him intervene with her job. When Ryota asked her about her opinion of the attacker, Kyoko revealed that she hadn't gathered enough information and guessed that Ryota had already thought about his own opinion. Kyoko finished inspecting Chisa's body and learned a lot of things regarding the attacker. She said to Koichi that she would go to inspectGreat Gozu's body to reveal the attacker's method. Kyoko appeared in Makoto's nightmare and apparently died from a stab on her chest with the attacker's signature knife. She came back to alive and scared Makoto until he woke up from his nightmare. Later, Kyoko alongside Ryota and Koichi woke up inside the room where Great Gozu's body located. She inspected his body for a while and decided to search for the third body. In the hallway, she was annoyed with Koichi's ramble about his hatred towards detectives. Eventually, Kyoko learned that Koichi only joking with her and took his advice to express her feelings more. Kyoko and Ryota found Sonosuke's dead body with the attacker's signature knife stabbed in his chest. Kyoko confirmed that he was the third victim but Koichi objected him. It turned out that Seiko Kimura's body also found pushed to the wall with blood coming out from her left abdomen. Kyoko took notes before Ruruka called for them from inside the lounge room. Kyoko and the others moved Sonosuke's body inside the lounge room and did some autopsy on his body. She found a strange white powder on his face and noticed a small amount of blood spotted on his left eye. To support her deduction, she asked Ruruka to stay with her to help her investigation. Kyoko makes a small appearance during the ending scenes after Monaca explains that one of the people who survived 'Big-Sis Junko's Killing Game' will not survive thanks to Makoto's actions. With that being said, Kyosuke is seen walking down a blue-lit hallway, katana in hand and automatically the scene is transported to the library with Kyoko looking up in potential shock at what might be coming her way. Kyoko continued to investigate Sonosuke's body while Ruruka continuously sought to hinder her findings. Kyoko was surprised to find Koichi is more resourceful than he seems by knowing Sonosuke's trap layout within the library. Juzo entered a little later and beat everyone in the library down and then focused entirely on Kyoko, seeking to finish off the job he tried to complete earlier. However, Koichi is able to protect her by leading Juzo away, but Ruruka has a plan of her own and blows up the floor using one of Sonosuke's explosives to make sure nobody else finds out the truth about how she murdered Sonosuke and her true intentions. As Kyoko was falling, Koichi set off his NG code in order to pull her up and used his last amount of strength to push her on to steady ground. Kyoko expressed muted shock as Koichi fell away from her, as she tried to reach out her hand to him, he falls too quickly and she missed her grip. After these events took place, Ruruka took control of Juzo to try and remove Kyoko and Ryota, but her plan fails and Kyoko, snapping out of shock, explained how Sonosuke's murder took place and the secret door's involvement in the matter. With Juzo and Ruruka occupied the secret doorway, Kyoko and Ryota escape the library in a hurry. In the ending scene, Ryota asks why Koichi decided to save her. Kyoko explains that she had her suspicions but no solid evidence. She then removes her jacket and states that she is a detective, implying that she still muted her emotions as she always has done. Kyoko and Ryota come to halt after escaping the library where Juzo and Ruruka were situated. After catching their breath, Ryota inquires as to whether leaving the exit behind was a good idea, Kyoko admits to him that it was indeed a fraud. She did understand that it led outside the facility but not in the way they would've wanted, beginning to reveal that the building they're in is, in fact, an underwater facility. She explains it would be an easy job to remove them from the room after the first sleep timer and make it look as convincing as possible that they hadn't ever been moved, she reveals her suspicions when Sonosuke's knife that damaged the conference room door is no longer there and the door is left undamaged, leading to the conclusion that if they were underwater, the chances of someone intervening would be slimmer and points towards Kyosuke as the culprit of the Final Killing Game as he was involved in the facility's construction from the very beginning. She concludes that the whole game they've been playing has favored only Kyosuke. She requests her and Ryota go look for Makoto and the others, to Ryota's displeasure, Kyoko explains Makoto is more than he seems, that he is stronger than anyone, optimistic and cares about his friends. She admits to being worried about him, with the way he puts everyone else's needs over his own, but that she believes in him because of this. As she gets to the climax of her speech, she is cut off as Aoi and Makoto show up behind her, the latter blushing and Kyoko begins to feel flustered herself, coughing as she tries to gain her composure once again. Kyoko, Makoto, Aoi, and Ryota found themselves later in an unknown room, discussing with each other as they eat and drink. Kyoko begins to inquire if Byakuya is on his way, but Makoto is still worried about the idea that someone may die because of him, explaining that Munakata believes his words have no power. Kyoko removes the glove from her left hand, something of which she has never done in front of anyone before unless it was 'someone close', she places her hand upon Makoto's. She tells him the power of his words has become everyone's hope, including her own. Kyoko further explains that they will all be behind him along the way. Kyoko and the rest of them, are later seen examining Kazuo's message of hope left behind after his death. Before the timer goes off for the fourth time, Makoto, Aoi, and Ryota make sure to barricade the room as Kyoko begins examining her NG code once more. Kyoko tells Makoto to never give up on hope and that whatever happens, she will always be there for him. The sleeping gas kicks in and they all collapse unconscious. Kyoko, the last one to go down, stares at Makoto and smiles before also losing her consciousness. When they begin to awake, Makoto is confident everyone has survived, until he, Aoi, and Ryota notice that Kyoko is motionless. They quickly approached her and checked her bracelet, specifically her NG Code: 'Passing the Fourth Time Limit With Makoto Naegi Alive'. They conclude that Kyoko is dead and break down into tears. Then Munakata speaks through the intercom in the Monitoring Room, inquiring whether Makoto has learned Kyoko's forbidden action and explaining that this proves further that his platitudes are useless. Makoto has a flashback of the time Kyoko saved him during the Killing School Life, she dropped down the trash shoot to save him from the trash disposal room and offered him food and drink. She inquired as to whether Makoto ever gave up, to which he replied his optimism is all he has going for him. Kyoko expressed that it was a wonderful thing he has going for him and then smiled in his direction to which he blushed, smiling in return. The scene was revisited to the point where Kyoko is dead and Makoto, Aoi, and Ryota are gathered around her, tearfully. After Kyosuke explains that Kyoko's NG code proved that Makoto's platitudes are useless, Makoto gathered his composure by remembering Kyoko's words, that she will always be 'by his side'. He wiped the blood of her left eye on his left-hand palm and went to meet with Kyosuke. Makoto explained to Ryota that he has no choice but to meet with Kyosuke and leave Kyoko, because she entrusted her hope to him by letting him live, and he has to fulfill what she believed in. Later Makoto is able to relate to Kyosuke in their battle by expressing to him that if Kyoko had turned to despair and tried to kill him or he had no choice but to kill her in order to stop her, that he would still be glad to have met her nonetheless. While Aoi watches over Kyoko's corpse, she finds her notebook, which contains the truth behind the Final Killing Game. A flashback is shown, revealing the point in time when the Future Foundation observes the end of the Killing School Life. The vault door of Hope's Peak Academy is opened, Kyoko and the remainder of the 78th class survey the despair laying around them, with Kyoko having a muted expression of shock. After Aoi finds Kyoko's notebook, she shares it with Makoto, Kyosuke, and Ryota. In it, Kyoko explains that the victims committed suicide, and the monitors in the building were somehow related, indicating that the victims watched some type of video. Makoto requested Kyosuke tie him up facing the monitor so he can test Kyoko's theory out himself. When Makoto forced himself to watch the brainwashing video, Kyoko appeared first, alongside Sayaka. She proceeded to taunt Makoto with the former, asking why he is still alive and placed the blame for their deaths on him. As their deceased classmates appear behind Kyoko and Sayaka, blood starts to flow out of Kyoko's eye, which was how Makoto and the others found her corpse. Makoto picked up a knife to kill himself as Kyoko instructed. She and Sayaka urged him to continue until Juzo quashes their efforts by knocking the knife out of Makoto's hand, effectively wearing off the brainwashing effect."
Who is the new headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy?,Kyoko,Side: hope - the academy of hope and students of despair,"Makoto began to reminisce about Kyoko, staring at her blood upon his hand. On the boat ride home,Mikan Tsumikiheld up a drug vial labeled Antagonist, whichNagito Komaedarealized Seiko had made during the killing game. Mikan explained that she had found someone who used the drug to save themselves from the NG Code Poisoning of the bracelets of the Final Killing Game, so she was able to revive them from a near-death state. This is shown to be Kyoko, who left the building alive and unharmed, meeting with Makoto who turned around in surprise. Several months after the event of the Final Killing Game, the Future Foundation rebuild Hope's Peak Academy. At the end of the scene, Kyoko entered a classroom where Makoto was located, telling him that everyone was waiting for him, the new headmaster of the Academy. It is implied that she helps run Hope's Peak Academy alongside Makoto as a vice principal."

During chapter 1 before starting the case, Kyoko tried to warn Yui that something was wrong and suggested to leave, but, seeing the three men walking ahead in front of them, she whispered that she couldn't ""leave them to die"" and decided to stay on board. Later when staring the case, Yui was very suspicious of Kyoko due to her being the only one alive after all the detectives have died. However, after discovering the true culprit, Yui apologized to Kyoko for being suspicious of her. After resolving Sirius Astronomical Observatory Murder Case, Yui and Kyoko got to know each other even more and became close friends even getting to know her grandfather. Yui also invites Kyoko for a Christmas party held in her school. Yui gives Kyoko a present, Rose In Vitro, which Kyoko is very pleased with.

As said previously by Yui, Yui doesn't see Kyoko as a replacement for her younger sister, still, she cares deeply for her and seems to be very protective of Kyoko. Yui's love for Kyoko is most notably seen in the third volume. During those events, Kyoko disappeared along with her grandfather. Yui was very worried about her disappearance and never gave up trying to search for clues related to her disappearance. Class 78th:"
What was Kyoko's relationship with Makoto during their school years?,a crush,Makoto naegi,"While their relationship during their school years is a bit unclear, inDanganronpa IFit's stated that Makoto had a crush on Kyoko, and Junko described her as Mukuro's ""rival in love"" due to Mukuro's secret crush on him. However, it was not mentioned how she felt about him. Since Makoto was originally shown interested in Sayaka, this seems to imply that at some point his affections turned towards Kyoko . In a high school picture, Makoto seemed to be looking at Kyoko and Sayaka while their class was out swimming. During the Killing Game, ever since the first murder, Kyoko became closer to Makoto, evident from her later interactions with him, hinting at some sort of mutual attraction. Kyoko also helped Makoto solve each Class Trial whenever he was out of clues. Both were on good terms with each other; Kyoko trusted Makoto but Makoto put his trust in her completely as he hoped that she would trust him as much as he trusted her. Regardless, Kyoko seemed to care more for Makoto as time went on. Evidence was shown when she entered his room and told Makoto to beware of Mukuro. She also saved him from Junko , who was about to kill him when he was asleep. When Makoto allowed himself to be found guilty in Chapter 5 , Kyoko realized that she had been putting her own desires ahead of his safety. When she discovered that Makoto ended up at the garbage disposal room, she risked her life to save him. Kyoko then showed her scarred hands to Makoto, which was a great sign of trust from her, as she stated that she showed her hands only to people she considered as close as family. During the last Class Trial, Makoto was the one who told the remaining students to not give in to despair, helping her overcome her state of shock over the intense pressure of the situation they were in. Kyoko told Makoto that even though she didn't know her dad, he would never tell her to stay in the school if it meant betraying and getting him murdered by Junko, thus showing their bonds and trust to each other. At their ""Graduation,"" Kyoko told Makoto she was actually kind of looking forward to facing whatever was out there if it was with someone like him, hinting that she possibly has romantic feelings for him. After joining the Future Foundation, she became Makoto's leader. Kyoko continued to admire his optimism, and Makoto, in turn, admired her 'cool' personality and considered her the person who had kept him alive. InDanganronpa 3, it became much more evident that the two had feelings for each other, especially notable in Makoto's shyer behavior and tendency to blush more often. During the collaboration game ofDanganronpa 3andGuns Girl Z, when Kyoko was accused of being so stoic that even Makoto couldn't find her cute, he then a bit shyly but firmly pointed out that he does, in fact, find her quite cute, which surprised her and made her blush. During the killing game, when Makoto overheard Kyoko talking about him withRyota Mitarai, Makoto blushed, embarrassed by Kyoko's small speech while Kyoko coughed awkwardly after realizing he heard her. At one point, Kyoko took off her gloves and held his hand to comfort him, and Makoto was also seen mimicking Kyoko's thinking posture at one point. In the Otomedia magazine, Makoto stated that Kyoko reminded him of autumn due to being cool as well as possessing a really warm and gentle side. He then got very nervous and defensive about the subject and tried to change it by stating that coincidentally her birthday was in October. This only made it even more suspicious, and he claimed he remembered her birthday because they were friends, yet he failed to remember his other friends' birthdays.[12]Aoi also appears to be very much aware that the two like each other, grinning widely after Kyoko's speech and later looking at the two while smiling knowingly, seemingly supportive of them. After he tried to protect the Remnants of Despair, Kyoko had to escort Makoto to his trial, and she promised to use her powers as his leader to protect him. At one point during the Final Killing Game, Makoto caught Kyoko talking about him with Ryota, which seemed to embarrass her a bit and made Makoto blush. Later, Kyoko ended up triggering her NG code of passing the fourth time limit with Makoto alive. It is possible Kyoko did not tell him because she believed he might sacrifice himself for her, and it's also possible she didn't know with full confidence that Seiko's Antagonist drug would be able to save her life completely. Instead, Kyoko gave Makoto words of encouragement before they fell asleep, telling him to never give up on hope and that she would always be by his side. After he was brainwashed, Makoto hallucinated the ""ghosts"" of Kyoko and Sayaka, as he believed that she was dead at the moment. Sayaka's ghost has been confirmed to represent his first love, implying that Kyoko was his current love. The two reunited after the Killing Game, and it was implied she helped Makoto run the rebuilt Hope's Peak Academy after the events ofSide: Hope. Friends:"
What does Kyoko ask Chihiro to do to start recording everything they would hear?,use his laptop,Alternate fates,"InDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc IF, Kyoko alone is not deceived by the claims of Junko that Mukuro Ikusaba and Makoto are the masterminds of the Mutual Killing Game after the failed execution and exposure of the former. She deduces that based on her own memory loss, Mukuro's statement that Byakuka had known Touko for nearly two years, and Genocide Jack's recognition of Mukuro, the rest of her classmates had their memories wiped in a manner similar to her own but on a smaller scale. Chihiro accompanies her to the infirmary at her request to investigate a destroyed Monokuma, where they find Naegi being cared for underneath a bed positioned in a blind spot from the door. After asking Chihiro to use his laptop to start recording everything they would hear, she then calls out to a hidden Mukuro and convinces the Ultimate Soldier that she wishes to hear what she has to say about their situation. Mukuro reveals that Kyoko is the Ultimate Detective and shares everything she knows about Junko and her plans, as well as Kyoko's purpose for coming to Hope's Peak Academy and the fate of her father.

How many half-siblings did Byakuya have?,fifteen,Early life,"Byakuya Togami is the heir to the worldwide financial conglomerate that is the Togami family. The Togami family has a ""peculiar inheritance system"", in which the male head of the family does not take a wife, but instead couples with exceptional women from around the world, in order to bear as many children as possible. As such, Byakuya had fifteen half-siblings, all potential heirs to the Togami family and fortune. Byakuya and his siblings were forced to battle against one another to become the next head of the family, and Byakuya was the last one standing, the first time in the history of the Togami family that the youngest male had won. The siblings who lost the battle were exiled from the family, considered ""unfit for the name of Togami"", and given a commoner life. Byakuya akins it to being killed, because being exiled is like death. After winning the battle, Byakuya became the chosen heir apparent to the Togami family. Despite the Togami Corporation's significant reach and power , Togami aimed to take the Corporation to even greater heights. He began managing business operations within the family, and gained access to vast financial assets, investing his portion intoday trading- selling stocks, shares and assets. Through this, he managed to amass a personal wealth of over four billion dollars, despite his young age. Within the family, the closest person to Byakuya was his butler, namedAloysius Pennyworth, who referred to Byakuya as ""Young Master"". Byakuya attendedGreen Hills High School[12]and was later scouted byHope's Peak Academyas part of Class 78th as the Ultimate Affluent Progeny."
Who was the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy?,Jin Kirigiri,Killing school life,"During the Tragedy,Jin Kirigiri, the Headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy, planned to seal the school building and let the students live forever inside the Academy in order to protect them from the destruction. The class agreed to his plan, and they sealed the building together. The students lived peacefully inside the school building for a year without knowing that theUltimate Despairmembers were already in their midst. The students soon became forced into thekilling game. As an incentive to murder in order to escape, the students were each given a DVD featuringa video from Monokumawhich implied that their loved ones were in danger. Byakuya's butler, Aloysius, was captured byUltimate Despairfor this motive. As the Killing Game began, Byakuya was extremely cold and dismissive towards the other students, making his dislike to them known and stating that he would not cooperate with them. He did not trust any of the other students, assuming any of them could be plotting a murder. Like the battle he had faced with to earn his place in the Togami family, he decided to treat the Killing Game as the game is claimed to be, one he intended to win. His dismissive and derogatory attitude towards the others ultimately led to Mondo snapping and attempting to attack Byakuya. Makoto tried to intervene, but became the target for Mondo's attack instead, resulting in Mondo knocking him out in a fit of rage. After the deaths of""Junko"",Sayaka Maizono, andLeon Kuwata, Monokuma opened up a new floor, where Kyoko found an old, dusty letter which stated that Hope's Peak Academy had been forced to shut down. Byakuya suggested that the letter could be fake, but believed that if it was real, then themastermindmay have placed them in a different school, citing that the mastermind was powerful enough to build a trial ground and a place for execution. The next day, instead of attending the regular morning meeting, he spent the morning reading in the library. When the other students came to look for him, he stated that he was trying to come up with something ""original"" for his plot, should he become avillainin the game. Mondo got angry at him again and threatened to kill him.Chihiro Fujisakitried to mediate the argument because they do not like the idea of friends killing each other or fighting - but Byakuya shut Chihiro down by stating that they aren't friends. Mondo threatened to kill him again for picking on those who couldn't fight back but declared that he wouldn't simply cooperate with anyone anymore. Byakuya remained in the Library, refusing to talk to anyone. Later when Toko and Makoto went to see Byakuya, he told them to get out and told Toko to take a bath, commenting on her smell. This caused Toko to misinterpret it as him caring about her and she quickly developed feelings for him. Before Monokuma'ssecond motive, Toko told Byakuya her secret: that she wasGenocide Jack. Whilst at the library, before going back to his room, Byakuya noticed Mondo leaving the girl's changing room and had a look inside, noticing the dead body of Chihiro Fujisaki. He decided to stage the scene to make the killing game more interesting for himself, as well as to reveal Toko's identity as Genocide Jack. Using an extension cord which would lead the other students to deduce he could be a suspect, he crucified Chihiro's body on a weight bench frame and wrote Genocide Jack's calling card ""Blood Lust"" on the wall in Chihiro's blood. The next morning, after the students received the announcement that someone had been murdered, Byakuya led Makoto and the others to the girl's changing room and agreed to co-operate with Makoto in the investigation, not revealing that he knew the true culprit. After investigating and finding a few more clues, Byakuya took Makoto to the library and showed him the Genocide Jack case file, where Makoto learned that Genocide Jack has a case of Dissociative Identity Disorder. Byakuya told him that all Genocide Jack killings had ""Blood Lust"" written beside them and top-secret information from police records stated that all victims were crucified. He then split up from Makoto. During the Class Trial, he quickly exposed Toko as Genocide Jack, shocking the others. He explained that he knew because Toko had disclosed it to him, which made her faint and her Genocide Jack personality to emerge. The other students deduced that Genocide Jack couldn't have killed Chihiro, because Chihiro was a girl , and that the murder weapon was a dumbbell rather than her signature Genoscissors. Suspicion quickly turned to Byakuya due to the extension cord the students had seen him using in the library, however, it was then revealed that Chihiro had actually been killed in the boy's locker room, and was actually male; both facts Byakuya did not know, which determined Byakuya wasn't the killer. He admitted at this point to staging the crime scene; much to his classmates' disgust and anger. When asked about his motives, he called them irrelevant but said they should look for the real killer. Later Mondo was found as the killer and wasexecuted. The group's attitude continued to sour towards him after learning what he had done to Chihiro's body and potentially could have led to them failing the class trial and being executed, despite his claim that he would have revealed the truth if they had come close to doing so. This came due to a head after Sakura was revealed to be a mole within the group; Byakuya showed no respect to Sakura, which angered Aoi so much that she slapped him across the face. After Sakura's death, Aoi fell into a deep state of depression and fury and attempted to manipulate the trial so that she would be the killer and lead to them all being killed. During the Class Trial, Byakuya became convinced that she killed Sakura, but when Makoto and Kyoko show evidence that showed that it wasn't her and was instead part of her plan, Byakuya became enraged that he had been so mislead in his deductions. Kyoko told that Byakuya that the reason he couldn't solve the case was because he was so dismissive of other peoples' feelings and does not understand that not everyone acts according to calculations and cost-benefit diagrams; much to Byakuya's shock. After the further deaths of their classmates, the students were forced into an investigation to identify the missing 16th student and ultimately deduced that the true mastermind of the killing game wasJunko Enoshima. Byakuya and the other remaining survivors were shocked to learn that the 'Junko Enoshima' they met was actually Junko's twin sister,Mukuro Ikusabaand that the world outside their walls was in a state of collapse due toThe Tragedy. Byakuya was shocked when Junko illustrated his family's current situation - or, ""lack of a situation"", given that his family had apparently been ""completely wiped out"" - and was rendered completely speechless for the first time since the start of the Killing Game. Byakuya and the other survivors began to fall to despair, only for Makoto to find his true self as the Ultimate Hope, and guide all of them back onto the path of hope. Makoto's speech to Byakuya helped him move past the initial shock of what Junko had revealed about his family, and he declared that as long as he were alive, the Togami Family would never truly die. He vowed to rebuild his family no matter what opposed him once he entered the outside world. Supporting Makoto, Byakuya and the remaining students voted for Hope - causing Junko to fall into one last episode of despair shortly before she executed herself inThe Ultimate Punishment. With Junko dead, the School Killing Life was finally over, and the survivors found an escape switch that would allow them to leave the academy. Their torments were finally over, Byakuya remained arrogant to his peers, but also finally admitted that, without everyone's help, he wouldn't have survived through this gruesome journey. Byakuya repeated his vow to rebuild his family with his own hands and declared that it would be far greater than before. With that, Byakuya emerged from Hope's Peak Academy as one of the survivors at the end of the game."
How did Byakuya save Yasuhiro from being shot by a helicopter?,Byakuya dispatched his own squad who successfully rescued them and transported them off of the island,The final killing game,"After returning from Jabberwock Island, Makoto was charged with the crime of treason for protecting the Remnants of Despair, and suspected he himself might be member of Ultimate Despair. A trial was set at a secret off-shore Future Foundation facility, where the heads of all the Future Foundation branches met to decide on Makoto's fate. Before the trial could be completed, the branch leaders and Makoto were all knocked out by sleeping gas and forced into a killing game - the ""Final Killing Game"" - a kill or be killed game of deduction. Byakuya, who was not in attendance, learned about the Killing Game after Makoto and Aoi managed to get in contact with him - Byakuya was shocked, because news of the Killing Game had not left the island. A ""peacekeeping squad"" was dispatched byKyosuke Munakatato Jabberwock Island on behalf of the Future Foundation to kill the survivors, because they still believed them to be dangerous and under the influence of Despair, but Byakuya dispatched his own squad who successfully rescued them and transported them off of the island. Byakuya mobilized his troops to go with him to the Future Foundation's headquarters. Byakuya suspected thatMonaca Towawas behind the killing game, and contacted Toko and Komaru, who are still in Towa City, to go after her, and sent some of his own men to go find her. Byakuya arrived at the Future Foundation's headquarters just in time to save Yasuhiro from being shot by a helicopter. After he landed, Byakuya had Hiro and his men planted explosives to blow open the sealed entrance. As Byakuya and his men investigated the lobby, they found the robotMiaya Gekkogahara, who triggered an alarm which caused the building to explode and be destroyed. Along with Hiro, Byakuya and his men managed to rescue Makoto and Aoi, and ordered his men to restrain a group of soldiers that had been brainwashed byRyota Mitarai. Yasuhiro and Byakuya found and rescued Aoi, and tied fresh bandages around her injured leg before heading for a tent outside."
What is Togami's surname?,Byakuya,Creation and development,"Byakuya was intended to be a cool character from the beginning, but because character designerRui Komatsuzakiwas not confident in drawing bishoujo/bishounen characters he ended up being the character that had the most retakes. After reading the game plot, Rui imagined Byakuya as a cold-hearted anti-hero, ""so I added some traits here and there, most relevantly my personal brand of high fashion, but still designing in a way he would be easily recognizable as an affluent heir"". According toKazutaka Kodaka, Togami is designed to be sexy, cold and stylish, but was actually the designatedbutt-monkeyon the creative team. For example, when they started considering a light novel with Togami as the protagonist, the conversation got derailed into jokes like ""It’d be nice to have a story where the Togami Conglomerate goes bankrupt and Togami lives in poverty"", ""Togami is a very proud man, so he would totally dress fancy to pretend he’s not broke"".[13] In Japanese Kanji, his name is written as 十神 白夜. His given name Byakuya means ""white night"", referring to theMidnight Sunexperienced in the Arctic or Antarctic circles. His surname Togami means ""Ten Gods"", refering to theten godsof theFour Pillars of Destiny."
What did Byakuya do after the death of Chihiro Fujisaki? Choose your answer from: A). He posed Chihiro's corpse to frame Toko Fukawa. B). He posed Chihiro's corpse to frame Toko Fukawa. C). He posed Chihiro's corpse to frame Toko Fukawa. D). He posed Chihiro's corpse to frame Toko Fukawa.,B).,Personality,"Byakuya is a cold and self-centered person who is very reserved. He is not interested in co-operating with others due to his own sense of self-superiority, and his opinion that others are, on the whole, lesser than him. This sense of superiority and black-and-white worldview comes as a result of his upbringing; Byakuya had to prove his worth in battle against his siblings in order to earn his role in the family as heir-apparent, whereas all his other siblings who lost the battle were effectively ex-communicated from the family and cut off financially, deemed ""unfit for the name of Togami"". Because Byakuya was raised in such a highly competitive environment of ""haves"" and ""have-nots"", he thinks all people only think about themselves and he dismisses emotional ties as petty and unimportant, in his own words: Due to his lack of emotional ties with the other students, Byakuya was able to emotionally distance himself from the horrors of the Killing School Life, and thus proved to be one of the most competent and insightful investigators in the group due to his high level of intelligence. His compulsive competitiveness caused him to treat the Killing School Life as simply a game, and one he fully intended to win, just as he had won his battle to become the head of the Togami family - much to the disgust of the other students. An extreme example of this occured after the death of Chihiro Fujisaki, where he posed Chihiro's corpse to frameToko Fukawaand ""make things more interesting"", and perceiving the dead body of Chihiro as simply ""an object"". However, Byakuya's emotional detachment and lack of empathy towards the others sometimes made it very difficult for him to understand the reasoning for why people would behave altruistically or based on pure emotion; this came to a head during the case ofSakura Ogami's death, where he could not understand why someone would be willing to give her life to save their friends, or whyAoi Asahinawould be willing to sacrifice herself and the others' lives purely to avenge Sakura's memory. This detachment would thus sometimes make him zero in on red-herring suspects and aggressively pursue them simply because he could not imagine an emotionally-driven motive. Sakura's case acted as a real turning point in Byakuya's approach to the Killing School Life, going from treating the other students as his enemies in the game, to focusing his energy on identifying and destroying the Mastermind: As described by Kazutaka Kodaka, he eventually became not just a serious character but often a butt-monkey, as he can sometimes appear comical due to how serious and dramatic he can be with his words and belief in his own superiority and how it frustrates the other students, and especially with his interactions with Toko or Genocide Jack. He constantly referred to the other students as ""amoebas"" and ""plebeians"". It also appears that he was taught strict manners by his family, as in the the first game he refused to use swear words and once said ""effing"" to avoid repeating Mondo's language, and is generally disgusted by vulgar words and behavior, and anything he considers barbaric. Due to his unusual upbringing, it's been shown that he has a bit poor knowledge on certain things that are considered common knowledge. He is confused by the idea of people making their own food, as his food is always prepared by a chef, and he doesn't know what toy vending machines are. As Byakuya greatly revered his family, often speaking of the vast power of the Togami Family, he initially did not take it well and had an unusually emotional reaction when Junko revealed the cessation of their existence. He would later recover from the shock to announce that they would rebuild the family from the ground up. Despite his generally cold attitude, he also does not look down upon his many half-siblings and instead feels some respect towards them. Despite still maintaining his cold and dismissive demenour towards others, the Killing School Life did appear to alter his worldview and make him more respectful and co-operative with others, though still denies that they are his friends. After initially being drawn towards Despair when Junko told him of the whole Togami family and corporation being destroyed, he seemed particularly effected by Makoto's relentless pursuit of hope and a brighter future for everyone, though he denied it to Makoto's face. He gave a rare genuine smile inDanganronpa: Another Episodewhen he was reminded of Makoto in the final trial asserting that ""hope keeps on going"", and agreed that the two of them would work together towards the common goal of ending the war of Despair vs Hope. From that point onwards, he used his wealth and power largely to support Makoto in their shared goal, particularly in helping to rescue and rehabilitate theRemnants of Despair, as despite their terroristic actions he and the other survivors of the Killing School Life were uniquely able to relate to their experience of being under the influence of Despair. He was also instrumental during theFinal Killing Game, coming to Makoto's rescue and saving his life, as well as bringing his own men to aid in the survivors' defense. These considerate and generous acts at the risk of his reputation - something he holds as an intrinsic core value - would have been out of character for him before the events of the Killing Game, but show how much of an effect the events he has experienced and the people he has met have had on him. His newly developed sense of respect for others did not appear to ever extend towards Toko Fukawa, however. Toko, and her alter ego Genocide Jack, developed an extremely unhealthy obsession and attraction Byakuya not long after meeting him, and she began stalking him and calling him her ""Master"". Her feelings were entirely unreciprocated - in fact, Byakuya was disgusted by her, particularly the fact that she rarely bathed. Byakuya normally distanced himself from others by insulting them, but this trait actually attracted Toko even more, openly inviting him to debase and degrade her and perceiving it as simply a ""lover's quarrel"", which made him unable to shake her off. His attitude towards Toko highlighted his manipulative streak, taking advantage of Toko's obsession in order to make her do menial tasks for him, while having so little respect for her that he outed her identity asGenocide Jackto Makoto and the others almost as soon as she revealed her secret to him in confidence. Unlike with the other survivors, his opinion of her did not soften after the Killing School Life ended, although he did appear increasingly more apathetic towards her rather than combative. Even after Toko helped to rescue Byakuya from being held captive by theWarriors of Hopeduring theDemon Huntinggame, when she tells Komaru that ""Master and I are rock solid. Even if we're far apart, our feelings towards each other will never change"" he counters her delusion by saying ""Yes, that's correct. It's true what you said. Even if we're apart, my feelings of disgust towards you will never change"". However, while later discussing the events with Makoto, he accepts that he owes a debt to Toko and Komaru for saving him."
What did Byakuya do to help save the Remnants of Despair?,try to locate and rescue his classmates' loved ones,Ultimate affluent progeny,"Byakuya's talent offered him a range of different skills. He is incredibly intelligent, as he was the first one to deduce that one of the group members had been betrayed. He also beat out all of his siblings and ran multiple branches of the Togami Empire, as well as acquiring a massive fortune for himself. His talent helped him in his role as a high ranking member of the Future Foundation's 14th branch. Despite serving underKyoko Kirigiri, Byakuya was always ready to take the lead when the situation called for it, and used his considerable wealth and power to assist in the war of Hope vs Despair, noteably in the rescue of the survivingRemnants of Despairfrom theFuture Foundationand in trying to locate and rescue his classmates' loved ones who were either captive or on the run from the Warriors of Hope in Towa City."
What did Jin Kirigiri plan to do during the Tragedy?,seal the school building and let the students live forever inside the Academy,Killing school life,"During the Tragedy,Jin Kirigiri, the Headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy, planned to seal the school building and let the students live forever inside the Academy in order to protect them from the destruction. The class agreed to his plan, and they sealed the building together. The students lived peacefully inside the school building for a year without knowing that theUltimate Despairmembers were already in their midst. The students soon became forced into thekilling game. As an incentive to murder in order to escape, the students were each given a DVD featuringa video from Monokumawhich implied that their loved ones were in danger. Aoi's brother,Yuta, was captured byUltimate Despairfor this motive. Aoi sometimes shared a dorm room withSakura Ogamibecause she was afraid of being alone at night after the Killing Game began, and appeared to spend the majority of her free time with her. Aoi and Sakura were key witnesses during the first trial, as they had seenSayaka Maizono, the victim of the murder case, enter the kitchen while they were hanging out in the cafeteria. They helpedMakoto Naegideduce that Sayaka herself was the one who took the knife from the kitchen, nother killer. After the deaths ofChihiroandMondo, Aoi's mental health began to decline slightly, crying alone sometime in her room and falling into a depression. She decided to go to the Cafeteria in search of donuts to soothe herself, but on the way there she heard strange sounds coming from the changing room near the bathhouse. Cautiously investigating the noise, she approached one of the changing room lockers, where she saw a ghostly green image of what appeared to be the recently deceased Chihiro. In fear, she screamed and fled back to her room. Still shaken, Aoi did not attend the customary morning meeting under the guise of not feeling well. The other students, concerned about her, asked why she had been absent and she explained that she had seen Chihiro's 'spirit' wandering in the changing room. When they went to changing room to investigate Aoi's claim, they discovered that the 'spirit' Aoi had seen was, in fact,Alter Ego, an Artificial Intelligence program that was made by Chihiro. Alter Ego's discovery caused a rift betweenHifumiandKiyotakawhich lasted several days, as both felt ""ownership"" over Alter Ego for various personal reasons. A few days after Alter Ego's discovery, several students were missing from the morning meeting. After searching for some time, Aoi and the others found Hifumi and Kiyotaka's bodies in the art room. With the death of two more of her classmates compounding her depression further, Aoi put Hifumi's head in her lap and began to weep. To her surprise, Hifumi regained consciousness momentarily, just long enough to speak the name ""Yasuhiro"" before succumbing to his head wounds and passing away. Shortly afterCelestia Ludenbergwas executed for the murders of Kiyotaka and Hifumi, Sakura, who had been forced to act asMonokuma's mole, decided that she had had enough of deceiving her friends and made up her mind to stop Monokuma's twisted games and confess to the others. Before Sakura could properly confess, however, Monokuma beat her to the punch by revealing her status as his mole. This revelation caused a major rift within the group dynamic, with most of the students pushing Sakura away except for Aoi, who tried desperately to protect Sakura from further slander. After Aoi was injured byGenocide Jackin a particularly heated confrontation, Sakura vowed to finally end things once and for all. She decided that the most unobtrusive way to go about fulfilling Monokuma's mutual killing instructions was to commit suicide; in doing so, she fulfilled his desire for a murder without harming any of her remaining friends. Against Aoi's advice, Sakura had attempted to make peace withYasuhiro Hagakure,Byakuya Togami, andToko Fukawa- all of whom had turned against her when she was revealed as the mole - before she died. She had invited all of them to the Recreation Room to talk to her, which Toko and Yasuhiro accepted. However, Yasuhiro thought that she was going to kill him, leading him to injure her with a Monokuma bottle. Toko, shocked by the sight of a bloody and injured Sakura, fainted and switched to Genocide Jack, who also panicked and struck her with another Monokuma bottle. Aoi then came in the Rec Room and found a severely injured Sakura. Sakura then asked Aoi to make her a bottle of protein shake from the powder Sakura had left in the Chemistry Lab. When she entered the Chemistry Lab, Aoi immediately spotted the spilled poison on the floor, and ran back to the Rec Room as quickly as she could, realizing that Sakura was attempting to kill herself. Sadly, the door could not be opened because Sakura had jammed it with a door leaning against the door handle. From the outside, Aoi could see Sakura sitting on the chair, lifeless. However, Sakura's sacrifice was severely complicated when Monokuma switched her suicide note for a fake he had written personally. When Aoi received the fake note, she was led to believe that Sakura had taken her life out of despair for the hostile situation in the academy. Infuriated and heartbroken by the ""confession"", and at the end of her emotional tether, Aoi attempted to frame herself as Sakura's murderer in order to get everybody killed as revenge for pushing Sakura over the edge. Her plan was foiled however, as the truth was eventually revealed, and Sakura's dying wish was fulfilled. Disgusted by Monokuma's deception, the remaining students united against him, vowing to find the secrets of the academy and stop the mastermind. She briefly feared that the others would turn on her for nearly getting them all killed, but the students decided to reconcile and unite their strength in order to take down the Mastermind. After some investigation by the students, the true mastermind of the killing game was deduced to beJunko Enoshima. Aoi and the other remaining survivors were shocked to learn that the 'Junko Enoshima' they met was actually Junko's twin sister,Mukuro Ikusaba, and that the world outside their walls was in a state of collapse due toThe Tragedy. In particular, Aoi was crippled by the knowledge that her fellow students were longtime friends before having their memories removed, coupled with the knowledge that they were essentially killing each other over nothing, which sent her to the brink of despair. Aoi was motivated by Makoto's words that hope is still alive, causing her to pause and consider what Sakura would say if she were still alive: ""You only get stronger by taking adversity by the horns! Confront that thorny path with enthusiasm!"" Realizing that Sakura would want her to move on in memory of the fallen, she decided to believe in Makoto. Along with the rest of her friends, Aoi witnessed Makoto - the newly-minted ""Ultimate Hope"" - managing to defeat Junko, leading to her executing herself ina special punishment. With Junko dead, the School Killing Life was finally over, and the survivors found an escape switch that would allow them to leave the academy. Aoi left the school with Sakura still on her mind, wishing her goodbye as she parted through the escape hatch, but resolving that ""If we gotta say goodbye, we may as well do it with a smile on our face!""."
How many students lost their title due to leaving Hope's Peak Academy?,1,Joining the future foundation,"At some point during or after The Tragedy drove the world to near-destruction, the Future Foundation was formed by alumni of Hope's Peak Academy to both defeat Ultimate Despair and undo the damage their actions had brought upon the world. The Future Foundation came to the assistance of the Hope's Peak Academy survivors following their victory over Junko Enoshima, and Aoi and the other survivors decided to join the organization, and the Future Foundation helped them to restore their lost school memories. Aoi became a member of the 13th Branch of the Future Foundation, which was tasked with front-line food and resource distribution. Due to leaving Hope's Peak Academy, students lose their Ultimate title. As a result, Aoi's new title became Former Ultimate Swimming Pro. Meanwhile, Aoi's brother, Yuta, who had been previously been held captive after being kidnapped by theUltimate Despair, escaped captivity, only to become a target of theWarriors of Hope. Yuta tried to escape Towa City by swimming away, but his Monokuma Bracelet exploded, killing him before he could reach the shore. Makoto, who had become increasingly sympathetic to theRemnants of Despairafter seeing the effects of despair firsthand, hatched a plan to capture the Remnants of Despair and rehabilitate them using theNeo World Program, a therapeutic virtual reality program that would hopefully reverse the brainwashing done by Junko Enoshima. Unbeknownst to Makoto, the Neo World Program was infected byAlter Ego Junko, which instigated theKilling School Trip. Ten out of fifteen Remnants of Despair remained comatose in the immediate aftermath, and the other five opted to stay on Jabberwock Island until they could find a way to help them. A ""peacekeeping squad"" was dispatched byKyosuke Munakatato Jabberwock Island on behalf of the Future Foundation to kill the survivors because they still believed them to be dangerous and under the influence of Despair, but Byakuya's own squad saved them and transported them off of the island. It's unknown how much Aoi was involved in the plot to rehabilitate the Remnants of Despair, but, given the other survivors' sympathy towards them and her later defense of Makoto, it can be assumed she was involved or supportive of the process in some capacity."
What did Aoi find inside the stall she found the bodies of 3 dead security guards?,the bodies of three dead security guards,The final killing game,"After returning from Jabberwock Island, Makoto was charged with the crime of treason for protecting the Remnants of Despair and suspected to be a member ofUltimate Despairhimself. Aoi attended the trial as the proxy for the 13th Branch leader, greeting Makoto with her peers Kyoko and Yasuhiro when he arrived at the off-shore Future Foundation facility. Aoi protested toKyosuke Munakataabout Makoto having to be handcuffed, trying to defend him from the physical abuse.Sonosuke Izayoistopped her by throwing akunaiin her direction, withRuruka Andothreatening that next time she tries to defend Makoto, Sonosuke would not miss. Kyoko and Aoi were banned from seeing Makoto while he was under arrest due to the Future Foundation's suspicions that they were his accomplices. During a break in Makoto's trial, Aoi and Kyoko went to the bathroom near the meeting room. While in there, the building began quaking, and Aoi grabbed the bathroom stall handle to try and balance herself. Inside the stall she found the bodies of three dead security guards. Horrified, she rushed to the boardroom to tell the other Future Foundation heads what she had found, but was overcome by sleeping gas. The trial of Makoto had been interrupted by Monokuma and forced the Future Foundation into theFinal Killing Game. Unlike previous killing games, this killing game had a different structure: every two hours, a sleeping drug would be administered though a special bracelet attached to their wrists, putting all but one of the participants to sleep. While the participants were told that at this stage one person would be kept awake and tasked with killing one other participant, infact the person who was closest to one of the red ""Monokuma monitors"" dotted around the facility would be awakened and forced to watch the Suicide Video that brainwashed that person to commit suicide. The bracelets on their wrists also displayed a personalized forbidden action called an NG Code; if the participant commits this forbidden action, or attempts to tamper or remove the bracelet, a lethal dose of poison would be administered. Aoi's NG Code forbid her to ""be hit with a punch or kick"". The Final Killing Game was masterminded by Future Foundation chairmanKazuo Tengan, who intended the killing game to pushRyota Mitaraito broadcast his Hope brainwashing video to the world to try and eradicate Despair for good. Ryota was not originally intended to participate in the game, but his unexpected appearance at Makoto's trial meant that Kazuo had no choice but to continue with Ryota included. Little did he know, Ryota's NG Code ""using your talent"", prevented him from broadcasting the Hope video, because he - the Ultimate Animator - had animated it. Because of this, the killing game led to the deaths of seven members of the Future Foundation, including Kazuo himself, before Ryota could attempt to use the video. Chisa YukizomeandDaisaku Bandaiare very quickly the first two victims of the killing game: Chisa brainwashed to commit suicide, and Daisaku for breaking his NG Code of ""witnessing violence by participants"". After Daisaku's death, Kyoko managed to create a diversion which allowed Aoi,Great Gozu, andMiaya Gekkogaharato help Makoto escape from Juzo and Kyosuke, who suspected Makoto to be the traitor behind the killing game. Because Makoto's NG Code forbade Makoto from running in the hallway, Aoi carried him on her back. As they hit a dead end, Gozu smashed through the wall during a fight with Kyosuke. Aoi threw a broken fire extinguisher at Kyosuke which gave Gozu the opportunity to body slam Kyosuke into the ground, allowing Aoi, Makoto, Miaya, and Gozu to escape from Kyosuke. Gozu barricaded the door behind them, just in time for the bracelets to release the sleeping drug and start the next round of the killing game. When they awoke, Makoto found blood on his hands and Aoi apparently dead with a knife lodged in her chest. However Aoi awoke and was not harmed at all: the knife was a toy, and the blood was tomato sauce. The scene had been staged byMonaca Towa, who was controlling Miaya. Instead, Gozu was dead. They were disturbed that someone had managed to get into the barricaded room. Aoi was saddened by Gozu's death, and covered his body with her jacket out of respect. Aoi, Makoto and Miaya sought out the building's intercom system. After finding it, Aoi heard someone nearby, and ran off to draw them away, followed by Miaya, and hid behind some rubble to listen to Makoto's speech over the intercom. Aoi and Miaya escaped from their hiding place after they heard an explosion. On the way, they met withKazuo Tengan's group and Aoi gladly reunited with Kyoko. Kyosuke's voice comes from the intercom, and he explained that he had captured Makoto and is planning to execute him - Kyoko suspects this is a trap. Proceeding with a new plan, Aoi and Miaya escorted Kazuo to negotiate with Kyosuke. Arriving at the scene, Kazuo tried to distract Kyosuke while Aoi untied the captive Makoto and helped him escape. Miaya noticed that someone has been following them and offered to stop them. Aoi didn't want her to go alone but eventually agreed to stay by Makoto's side, promising her to eat donuts together after everything came to an end. Some time later, Aoi and Makoto encountered Miaya, who had been knocked down by Juzo. Makoto insisted that Aoi should escape, but instead she grabbed a metal pipe to fight Juzo. Aoi mocked the former Ultimate Boxer for using a weapon to fight her instead of his bare fists. Aoi was in the middle of her fight with Juzo whenSeiko Kimuraand the reactivated Miaya interrupted it. Seeing that as a chance to escape, Aoi put Makoto on her back and fled from the scene with Miaya. The group learned that Kazuo was the third victim, killed by Kyosuke. Aoi felt increasingly frustrated that, if not for her NG Code preventing her from fighting, she could try and stop the killing game. When Aoi overheard a conversation between Makoto and Komaru over Miaya's monitor, their relationship reminded Aoi ofher own deceased brother. Escaping through a hole in the wall, they encountered Kyosuke, who is determined to kill them both because he still suspects Aoi and Makoto are both part of Ultimate Despair. Miaya immediately came to their aid, battling Kyosuke and giving them another chance to escape and go to find Kyoko. Aoi and Makoto reunite with Kyoko and Ryota, and the group barricade the door before the next round begins. They awake to find Kyoko dead, Kyoko having been poisoned by her bracelet for breaking her NG Code: ""passing the fourth time limit with Makoto Naegi alive"". Aoi breaks down in tears, with her sadness only worsening when Kyosuke transmits a message over the intercom proclaiming that Kyoko's death proved how useless Makoto's platitudes were. Makoto decided to go and speak to Kyosuke, and asked Ryota to stay with Aoi due to her being so distressed. Makoto tells Ryota that because Kyoko entrusted her hope to him, he has to stop Kyosuke. Aoi stopped crying after this statement, telling Makoto she believed in him. Aoi found Kyoko's notebook hidden under her body, where Kyoko had concluded who has been killing the victims of the killing game: themselves, brainwashed into suicide by a video playing on the monitors. To test Kyoko's theory, Makoto instructed Kyosuke to tie him up facing one of the monitors - he believes he won't be susceptible, due to refusing to give up on hope, and his promise to go rescue Komaru when the killing game was over. Aoi and the other remaining participants are knocked out by the sleeping drug. When they awoke, Makoto confirmed that the monitors broadcast a despair brainwashing video. Aoi shattered the monitor, finding a knife hidden behind it. Aoi and the others learn from Kyosuke that, other than himself, Kazuo was the only other person with authority to install equipment in the building, leading her and the others to the conclusion that Kazuo was most likely the mastermind behind the Final Killing Game. Juzo then proceeded to the power room and turned off all switches, de-activating the bracelet and monitors, and free the surviving participants from the game. Ryota revealed that Junko had been using his anime technique to spread Despair with brainwashing videos, but was interrupted by a message from the deceased Kazuo before he could elaborate. The group learned that Kazuo may have been a Remnant of Despair as he admitted to setting up the Final Killing Game. Ryota collapsed to the floor in anguish over being betrayed, but Aoi tried to be optimistic, saying the wristbands are removed so they are free of the game, so now they can look to the future. Ryota expressed that he couldn't run away, not as he did back when Junko used him for his techniques to create the Despair Video. This time, he had to fight by showing everyone the opposite video of Despair Video, the Hope Video. As he began to walk away, Aoi rushed in front of him, convincing him to reconsider his choices, as Makoto and she felt that a hope video would only force people to believe in hope rather than changing their attitude by themselves. Ryota showed Aoi his Hope Video, brainwashing her to follow his command. He told her to restrain Makoto and she did as commanded; to Makoto's anger, Ryota was able to get away. The Future Foundation's rescue squad, who had also been put into a brainwashed state under Ryota's control, found Aoi and Makoto and attempted to fire at them. Makoto pleaded with Aoi to run, but she was still under Ryota's influence and continued to restraining him. They were rescued by Kyosuke, who knocked the soldiers to the ground. Aoi was finally able to break free of her brainwashed state, and the three hatched a plan to stop Ryota. Kyosuke drew the rescue squad's attention while Aoi and Makoto ran through the halls to find Ryota, but Aoi was shot in the leg, forcing Aoi and Makoto to hide. Makoto helped to bandage Aoi's wounded leg and then reluctantly left her to try and stop Ryota. He is cornered by the Future Foundation's rescue squad, only to be rescued by Yasuhiro and Byakuya."

Aoi can be quite air-headed and forgetful, relying on the memory trick of writing people's names three times on her hand in order to remember them - a trick she also taught to her brother, Yuta. Due to being quite air-headed, she can be easily manipulated by others and jump to conclusions or take them at face value, often being one of the few to fall for killers' tricks and misdirection during Class Trials. Aoi is an extremely athletic person and considers it an absolutely fundamental part of herself, using it as an important coping mechanism in her daily life and feeling like she ""might die"" if she can't exercise. Although Aoi is a star athlete in the running to become an Olympic swimmer, Aoi is insecure that being athletic, which is seen as quite a masculine activity, makes her undesirable to others and might lead to her never finding love. She's also concerned that her extreme sweet tooth, particularly her love of eating donuts, is going to make her fat. Her positive attitude is truly challenged by the events of the Killing Game, and it fundamentally changes her outlook on the world and her relationships. She is extremely loyal to her friends to such a degree that, when they are harmed, it shatters her ability to emotionally cope. She very nearly falls into despair during the events of the Killing School Life, as the emotional snowball of the continuous deaths compounded her sadness exponentially, crying alone in her room in the evenings and frequently comfort eating. This came to a breaking point after the death of Sakura Ogami, where she felt so hopeless to the point she was willing to get herself and the other survivors killed to avenge the death of her closest friend, who had been shunned by the rest of the group. It took the support of her other classmates and learning that Sakura had sacrificed herself to try and save the others for path to recovery to begin. Aoi very quickly gravitated towards Sakura as a fellow athlete, and the two formed a very strong bond, spending the majority of their free time together and becoming very protective towards each other. She also became extremely close to Makoto Naegi, whose ability as the Ultimate Hope was vital in her path to recovery both during the Killing School Life and when she was emotionally tested once more by being thrown into the Final Killing Game. Aoi was very effected by Makoto's strong and unwavering belief in the power of hope and friendship, and in her darkest moments during both the Killing School Life and Final Killing Game, he was able to bring her back from the brink and believe that the future was worth living for to honor the memory of the friends they lost along the way."

What color is Junko's hair?,strawberry-blonde,Appearance,"At the end of theKilling School LifeinDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, Junko appears to be a young high school-aged teenager, but due to her causing her classmates memory loss, she is two years older than they all believed her and themselves to be. She has a tall, dramatic hourglass figure, light blue eyes, and long, thick, bleached strawberry-blonde hair tied in two twin pigtails. Due to her fake talent, she wears heavy make-up along with fake long red nails. Due to being related, Junko and her older twin sisterMukuro Ikusabashare several physical characteristics. However, Junko has a considerably larger chest than Mukuro and weighs two pounds more than her. Junko's eyes are more round and larger and are blue with her contacts or naturally red compared to Mukuro's light purple eyes. Junko also lacks freckles. Junko's usual outfit includes a black cardigan over a white dress shirt, with both left open to the third button to expose the top of her black-and-red bra, a red pleated miniskirt that is cut extremely short, and mid-sized black boots with platform heels and red laces. Her cardigan is accented with white symbols of herFormer High School. She accessories with a long tie that hangs loosely around her neck with a design alternates between pure white and as half black and white with a prohibition sign on it that hangs loosely around her neck, a thin black choker, a red bow above her left breast, and two buttons on her right side. Her most notable accessory is her signature twin bear hair clips that are based onMonokuma's two sides. The right clip is a completely white bear with dot eyes and a neutral expression, while the left is a black bear with a white muzzle, jagged red eyes, and a wicked smile . During her time atHope's Peak Academy she instead wore a set of hair clips of a cute white bunny and a large red and white bow. Due to her constantly-shifting personalities, Junko's appearance shifts slightly with her mood. Junko's ""moods"" included herMonokumapersona, sickening cuteness, severe depression, clinical sophistication, boisterous vulgarity, eerie stoicism, and haughty superiority. Her ""haughty superiority"" personality dons a small gold and red crown with encrusted jewels. Her ""clinical sophistication"" personality wears glasses and styles her hair in a ponytail, carrying a pen and board. Her ""severe depression"" personality sports a few multicolored mushrooms on top of her head with a blueish forehead with no pupils. Additionally, her right hair clip has a sad face. Her ""sickening cuteness"" personality simplifies her entire appearance to appear more cartoonish, including smoother pigtails, large, bright eyes, and a small smile. Her ""boisterous vulgarity"" personality is similar toGenocide Jack, as she has a reddish forehead and she talks with her tongue out, along with having messier pigtails and doing the hand-horn gesture. Her ""eerie stoicism"" personality involves her doing a pose that turns her body away slightly to the left with one arm around her torso and one covering part of her face with a constant serious expression. Lastly, her Monokuma personality involves her having Monokuma in front of her. InDanganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School, she temporarily wore a cheetah-print dress with a pale yellow fur collar and cuffs, a thick black belt with a sliver buckle, a thigh band which is quite similar to her choker, and black shoes with heels. She accessorizes with brown sunglasses with deep pink lenses and the same set of hair clips when Mukuro posed as Junko, a cute white bunny and a large red and white bow. She is also seen with theHope's Peak Academy's uniform. She wore a bleached brown cardigan over a white dress shirt, unbuttoned to expose her half of her bra, a pure white tie tied loosely, a navy blue pleated skirt, and mid-sized black boots with platform heels and red laces, with the same bunny and bow accessories. Her cardigan is accented with buttons of herFormer High School. InDanganronpa Zero, it is stated that she looks much more average without her make-up. It is also shown that her natural hair and eye color is red, considering her she doesn't remember being ""Junko Enoshima"" while assuming her alternative identity:Ryoko Otonashi. In earlier installments of the series, such asDanganronpa ZeroandMonaca Towa's flashbacks inDanganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls, Junko is seen in the third variation of her Hope's Peak Academy outfit. Her cardigan has been removed, and her dress shirt is buttoned up to hide her bra. Her red bow tie is pinned on the left side of her dress shirt, and her right pigtail is held by a black bunny clip with red eyes. She also wears a black miniskirt and a new tie that lacks the circled X and has a different balance of white and black; the collar and knot are white, while the rest is black. Junko's nails are still painted red, but they are much shorter than in her other appearances."
What does Junko Enoshima's real personality look like?,very apathetic and easily bored to an unhealthy and abnormal degree,Personality,"As a young fashionista, Junko Enoshima is described as simply ""not fake"", charismatic and eager to try new things. Duringherfirst appearances, she comes across slightly air-headed and hot-tempered. In the official artbook, she is described as a person who ""drips with dissatisfaction the moment she opens her mouth"" and tends to be in trouble with her classmates. She is also mentioned to be a bit too talkative with an overly carefree attitude. However, Junko's real personality, revealed at the conclusion of the Killing School Life, is notably different: very apathetic and easily bored to an unhealthy and abnormal degree. Because of this, her behavior and mannerisms tended to be extremely erratic and unstable by her own autonomous design; keeping up one ""appearance"" for too long bores her, which causes her to often switch between her aforementioned different personas. She switched between these personas regularly, often imitating other students' expressions, which made for a highly unsettling conversation with the survivors. Her voice will either have a different tone or accent within the switches, such as ""haughty superiority"" giving her a voice similar to a stereotypical British monarch, her ""sickening cuteness"" giving her a higher pitched voice, her ""clinical sophistication"" giving her a more mature or deeper voice, making her speak as if she was, as her appearance suggests, a teacher/professor, her ""severe depression"" giving her a more sad voice, as if she was on the verge of crying, her ""eerie stoicism"" giving her a monotone voice, her ""boisterous vulgarity"" sounding similar to a stereotypical rockstar, and her Monokuma one mimicking his voice. While entering the Hope's Peak Academy as one of Class 78's students, she often talked as if narrating a story, writing down her thoughts in a notebook. Above all, Junko was deeply obsessed with despair, having found despair to be the most enjoyable emotion for her, whether it be inflicting despair unto others, or suffering from despair wholeheartedly. This made her extremely dangerous, as she wished to makethe whole worldfeel absolute despair. However, this also often proved to be her biggest weakness, as she gave her opponents a ""fair"" chance to defeat her in order to make their despair all the greater if they fail, and happily welcomed her own despair if her plans failed. Both Junko herself and the game'screatorshave confirmed that she truly has no reason to do the things she does other than despair itself, which makes her all the more dangerous and unable to be reasoned with. However it is hinted at in the anime that her analytical talent was what caused her to turn to despair, and that Hope's Peak was her first target because they see talent as hope, and use that talent for their own benefit, which drove Junko to take the talent they loved so much and use it for evil, which shows her in a more understandable light. It's also shown that under her amnesiac state, Junko doesn't show a thirst for despair or particularly strong hatred of boredom, implying that her constant case of forgetfulness had spared her from embracing despair again. However, the return of her memories reverted her to her former ways. As the mastermind and leader of Ultimate Despair, Junko was shown to be highly intelligent, cunning, somewhat impulsive, extremely manipulative, and violent and cruel without remorse. She was a highly toxic individual, being both physically and mentally abusive to everyone around her. She manipulated people into falling madly in love with her and used their weaknesses, theirdespair, against them. Things like hope, peace, and happiness disgusted her, but she sometimes gave hope to others, only to turn it into greater despair later. She often manipulated people into doing bad things instead of directly doing them herself and then had a habit of blaming these manipulated people and claiming it wasn't her fault, as a part of proving her point that despair exists in everyone and that hope will naturally lose to that despair. While she is very skilled, Junko can also lie and cheat to further her own goals, even if it's hypocritical and goes against her beliefs. It should be noted that even though she claims despair is the great unknown, in the end, the road of despair went exactly the way she had planned. Despite that she can be cruel and abusive to some, Junko is actually capable of feeling love to those she's close with, however due to how far despair has driven her, she kills them anyways to cause herself to feel large amounts of despair. According to Kodaka and Junko's voice actress, her personality inDespair Arcis a more natural version of her, closer to her true self and more neutral, before she started changing her personalities regularly. This seems to imply that her behavior in the first game is a result of decreasing mental health and deeper sinking into despair, explaining her more jaded and apathetic personality. This also implies that even the Tragedy was beginning to bore her, as the seemingly chaotic event went just like she planned."
What color is Junko's cell phone?,blue,Ultimate fashionista,"Junko's initial talent and the one she is famous for. She is very popular among people and students in Hope's Peak Academy; even theSteering Committeeguaranteed her talent. She often appeared in magazines as the cover model. She uses her Super High School Level Analytical Prowess talent to her advantage in order to simulate and make it look like this is her main talent, as she can predict trends. In the original Japanese, Junko's title is Super High School Level Gyaru . The termgyaru refers to a Japanese street fashion subculture. Gyaru fashion is typically characterized by having heavily bleached or dyed hair , highly decorated nails, and dramatic makeup. Since Junko is still a high school student, she is technically a コギャル ""kogyaru"" . Kogyaru are known for altering their school uniforms and their fondness of platform boots - two visible features of Junko's attire. Decorating one's cell phone extensively is a signature Gyaru habit, which explainsAlter Ego Junko's choice of an over-adorned cell phone as her courtroom avatar for the final trial ofDanganronpa 2. Gyaru, in general, are also fond of bleaching their hair and wearing colored contact lenses - making it highly probable that Junko has neither naturally strawberry blond hair nor naturally blue eyes. Bearing this fact in mind, it is very much possible that Junko's natural hair and eye colors are those of her temporary identity,Ryoko Otonashi."

This talent gives her an excellent ability to make very detailed plans in a short amount of time. She is also excellent at reading and thus manipulating others. She can often predict what a person is going to do before they do it - an ability she can use to defeat opponents much stronger than her. It is also this ability that threw her into boredom since she was able to accurately guess how events would play out; this fueled her love of despair as an ""unknown""."
How does Junko use her talent as the Super High School Level Analytical Prowess?,manipulate or exploit people around her to do her bidding,Ultimate despair,"Junko has the ability to cause nearly anyone to fall into despair, and she revels in the despair felt by herself and others. Using her talent as the Super High School Level Analytical Prowess, she could detect everyone's weaknesses and use this information to manipulate or even exploit people around her to do her bidding. This was demonstrated by how she could prevent theWarriors of Hopefrom committing suicide and persuaded them to join her in spreading despair by killing adults. It's also been shown that she has severely abused her sister and made her very dependent of her. However, it should be noted that she usually takes the more personal approach only with people she is genuinely interested in. She tends to literally brainwash masses, using videos created withRyota Mitarai's animation brainwashing technique and her own talent of despair. The only person she could never get to was Makoto, who could be considered the true Ultimate Hope in the same way Junko is considered the true Ultimate Despair. In the case of Izuru, the original Ultimate Hope, he was never truly loyal to her and his despair was caused solely by his own boredom."
What did Junko do to get Yasuke out of his house?,she ran up to him with a large smile and whispered in his ear that she was the culprit who destroyed the sculpture,Prior tothe tragedy,"Much of Junko's early life is unknown. As children, Junko and her twin sister Mukuro lived in abject conditions and were even homeless at one point. As she puts it, she regretted the moment of her own birth, feeling that her birth into the world was a mistake. Due to her analytical skills allowing her to predict the outcome of events, she became bored with the world. Because of that, she took an interest in despair, which she believes is unpredictable and exciting, at a very young age. As a child, she was close withYasuke Matsuda, as they didn't have any other friends. One particular moment between the two when they were elementary school students was when Junko spent a month building a sand sculpture modeled after the Sagrada Familia church at the public park, and she even used very advanced techniques for her age. The sculpture got closer to completion and many people from around the neighborhood came over just to watch her work. One day, the sandcastle was found destroyed just before it was completed. Junko cried continuously for almost an entire day and Yasuke went around angrily looking for the perpetrator. Not being able to find out anything useful discouraged Yasuke. While he was sitting on a bench in front of the remains of the sand sculpture, Junko ran up to him with a large smile and whispered in his ear that she was the culprit who destroyed the sculpture all along, asking him to keep it a secret. When asked for a reason, she replied that she did so by accident. Truthfully, she had done this to get Yasuke out of his house, upset that his mother's condition had led him to become more withdrawn than usual. In the years following the death of Yasuke's mother, Junko became the person that Yasuke felt he could always lean on. She promised to always be there for him, which helped develop his stronger feelings towards her. She said she'll never forget Yasuke even if she forgets everything else, and they'll always be together. For the first time in his life, Yasuke cried in front of another person, after making her promise she won't make fun of him, won't tell anyone and won't try to console him. Junko had romantic feelings for Yasuke, referring to them as ""lovers"", though Yasuke denied this. Junko had a strong desire to ""paint the world in despair"" and planned to startThe Tragedy, the worst, most despair-inducing incident in the history of mankind. She called herself and her sister the Despair Sisters AKA the Ultimate Despair. As a teen, Junko began a modeling career and quickly became an idol amongst the Japanese population with her extravagant tastes. One reason for her popularity was the fact that, ironically, she didn't seem fake. Also, she used her Analytical Prowess talent to predict the latest trends. Her career created a lot of unwanted attention as well; she claimed that the only men who were interested in her were ""creeps who did not actually care about her."" Junko used to attend Gunma Prefectural Shibutani High School. She was scouted into Hope's Peak Academy as the Ultimate Fashionista along with her twin sister Mukuro, the Ultimate Soldier, into Class 78th. Unlike other students, her admission is a special case by the recommendation ofthe Steering Committee; her talent is guaranteed by the Committee, with explicit dis-involvement ofJin KirigiriandKoichi Kizakura. The responsibility of her as a student was placed upon the headmaster after her admission, with the Committee removing their responsibility on her development."
Why did Junko ask Mukuro if she has more freckles than when they last saw each other?,trying to repeatedly stab her with it,Danganronpa 3: the end of hope's peak high school-despair arc,"Junko first appeared walking out of a taxi at the airport, leaving a wallet rigged to explode in the car as a ""tip"" for the driver. She then walked into the airport and waited for her sister Mukuro, while narrating her plan to the viewer and her sister. The two are later seen in a limo. Junko asked Mukuro if she has more freckles than when they last saw each other while picking up an ice pick, trying to repeatedly stab her with it, which Mukuro managed to easily block. Mukuro, in her head, mentioned how her sister was trying to taste the despair of killing her own sister; thinking about how her Mukuro would surely fall into despair if she succeeds. Junko then took out a grenade and, after jumping to the other side of the limo, threw it at Mukuro. Mukuro, however, simply picked up the grenade with her champagne glass and threw it outside the limo, detonating underneath another car and blowing it up. Following that, Junko went back to Mukuro and told her that she stinks, blaming it on her body odor, as she insisted that she had been bathing. Mukuro then asked Junko why she contacted her. Junko explained that the two of them had been scouted by Hope's Peak Academy and that they would be attending school there. The two are later seen at the school ceremony, right behind Makoto, who was about to walk into the school as Junko narrated the story. Mukuro asked Junko if narrating was her current obsession. Junko replied that it was, but that she already got bored of it, as she drew a picture of Monokuma. Sometime after the entrance ceremony, Junko kidnapped one of the Hope's Peak Academy trustees and tortured him by scooping his eye out with a spoon covered with curry. She explained to her victim that torturing someone with something familiar and seemingly harmless was more effective than conventional methods of inflicting pain. With her sister assisting her, Junko managed to reach the room where Izuru Kamukura was being held. As Mukuro killed the guards, Junko, while eating takoyaki, told her to clean the mess she had made as they finally arrived in front of the room. When Mukuro noted that the door had a retinal scanner, Junko stated that she had ""borrowed"" what they needed and picked the trustee's eyeball from her takoyaki, granting the sisters access to the room. Junko excitedly showered Izuru with flattery before starting to manipulate him by threatening to kill him with a knife. However, Izuru easily blocked Junko's attack and pinned her to the floor while he effortlessly slammed Mukuro into the wall. Junko then shared with Izuru her interest in despair, which Izuru said was illogical, to which Junko responded that logic was irrelevant to her. Izuru then deduced that she had super analytical abilities and asked Junko why she would place herself in a situation where she would obviously lose. Junko revealed that the reason why she loved despair so much was because of that super analytical ability—she had gotten bored with the world and she believed that only despair could save her from that boredom. She also recognized Izuru's own analytical abilities and persuaded him to join her side. As Junko began to visibly enjoy her situation, the alarms activated and Izuru was prompted to knock her out. Junko regained her consciousness inside the school's hospital, where Mukuro told her that she managed to make excuses for her injuries, claiming that she tripped and fell down a flight of stairs. Mukuro then told her that after Izuru knocked her out, he informed her that he would be ""waiting"" for the two of them. Junko excitedly jumped out of the bed and resolved to meet with him despite her injuries. As the sisters were leaving the hospital, they passed byRyota Mitarai. Junko showed an immediate interest in him, claiming that their meeting was yet another fateful encounter. Outside of the Hope's Peak hospital, Junko asked Ryota about his talent and he replied that he was the Ultimate Animator. Junko eagerly asked to see his anime and Ryota invited the two sisters to his dorm to show them. After watching Ryota's anime, Junko and Mukuro were so moved that they had been reduced to sobbing messes. Junko was intrigued as Ryota explained the techniques he used, equating it to brainwashing. He justified the moral discrepancies by saying it could be used in a beneficial way, as Junko began to see it as something she could use to her advantage. Junko set Ryota up in the office of the missing Steering Committee member while Mukuro brought Mikan, whom she had abducted, to Ryota's dorm. Junko decided to make Mikan watch the anime. She then left Mikan for Ryota to find while she and Mukuro went to get Izuru. Junko wanted to show Izuru the Student Council Killing Game she had planned and so invited him to watch the despair-inducing event. The Despair Sisters assembled the Student Council, intending for them to kill each other. The council refused even after Junko unveiled tapes that have their parents' scandals on them. Before the Killing Game started, Junko gave Mukuro a piece of sheet music and ordered her to sing while the frightening event occurred. As the chaos unfolded, Junko made her way into the control room with Mukuro. As she observed the massacre taking place on the security cameras, Junko talked about how she believed that despair could make life more interesting. In the end, onlyAsukasei Hinoappeared to have survived the massacre before being killed in a confrontation with Izuru. Before his death, Izuru seemed shocked as the dying council member set off a shot that managed to graze his cheek. In truth,Sōshun Murasamehad also survived the killing game, albeit with a severe head injury. Junko sent a mass e-mail to all of the Reserve Course students, exposing the Student Council massacre and Izuru's existence. She used security footage to frame Izuru as the sole murderer and revealed that the Reserve Course had been implemented to acquire the money for human experimentation. This caused the Reserve Course to riot, ultimately leading to theParade of the Reserve Course. In a secret room she gained access to by killing a trustee, Junko was solving a jigsaw puzzle and looking at Class 77-B's wonderful photos filled with so much hope while the brainwashed Mikan told her that the class repChiaki Nanamiand the homeroom teacherChisa Yukizomehad worked so hard for her class. This information developed Junko's interest in making Class 77-B turned from the class full of hope into Ultimate Despair. Junko advised Ryota to return to his class. When he replied by questioning why Junko was wasting her time solving a jigsaw puzzle, Junko simply flipped the already-solved puzzle and answered that when the order she spent a long time building was ultimately swallowed by chaos, it would cause great despair. Junko later appeared in Ryota's dorm by kicking Mikan, who was trying to seduce Ryota into despair. When Ryota asked Junko if she was the one who drove Mikan into despair, she answered by pulling out her project presentation, during which she explained how planned to use Ryota's brainwashing anime technique by combining it with the tape recording of The Tragedy of Hope's Peak Academy, resulting in a brainwashing video dubbed theDespair Videoto knock the world into despair. Junko blackmailed Ryota by choosing his classmates as the participants of the next Mutual Killing Game if he wouldn't cooperate with her. Due to Mikan's disappearance, her classmates went out to search for her. As they searched,Nagito Komaeda, with Chiaki, discovered Junko's secret hideout, claiming he found it due to his luck. Junko was impressed with Nagito after he stopped Mukuro from intervening with him and asked how he could track so much information regarding her movement. As Nagito rambled about hope, Junko showed her disgust by calling that his love for hope insane to a despairful degree. When Nagito pointed a gun at Junko, she didn't move, as she already predicted that Izuru would come to save her by jamming Nagito's gun and shooting him with it. She praised Izuru for this, once again to no reaction. Junko interrupted the conversation between Izuru and Chiaki, who had been desperately asking about his previous identity asHajime Hinata. She introduced herself as the mastermind of the entire Tragedy of Hope's Peak Academy to Chiaki. As she already been interested in Chiaki before their first encounter, Junko had planned to make her watch the Despair Video. However, Chisa arrived and created a diversion by throwing a fire extinguisher, allowing Chiaki and the collapsed Nagito to escape from Junko's grasp. After the two students left, Junko told Chisa that she had let Chiaki and Nagito escape because she had come up with a better plan. After she introduced herself and Izuru to Chisa, she explained that the students of Class 77-B would be filled with despair that day via brainwashing using the Despair Video. To show the results of the brainwashing, Junko called in an already-brainwashed Reserve Course student and ordered him to commit suicide. As he slowly killed himself by cutting his own neck, Junko excitedly told Chisa that she too would fall into despair, just like him. Junko and Mukuro bound Chisa to a chair and forced her to watch the brainwashing video. When Chisa displayed resistance to its effects, Junko, having matters to attend to elsewhere, ordered Mukuro lobotomize her. Junko gathered with a crowd of Reserve Course students on a bridge as they accompanied her in bidding her farewell to Ryota, who had escaped from her hideout. She thanked him for making his part in completing the Despair Video, as because of his ""hard work"", she was going to brainwash Ryota's classmates and plunge the world into despair. Junko pretended to soothe the panicked Ryota by assuring him that the creation of Despair Video was not his fault at all and told him to run, knowing that running away from the problem would be Ryota's despair. WhenJuzo Sakakuraconfronted Junko, the onslaught of Reserve Course students overwhelmed him, causing him to lay at Junko's feet in disbelief. She expressed disappointment that she was unable to defeat him by exploiting his supposed weakness instead. She then revealed this weakness, showing a picture to Juzo on her phone of him gazing lovingly at a picture ofKyosuke Munakata. She threatened to show it to Kyosuke and expose Juzo's feelings for him. Juzo begged her not to, and Junko agreed under the condition that he attests to her innocence and erode suspicion from the higher-ups of her connection to the recent chain of events. When he agreed to this half-heartedly, she aggressively pressed her stiletto onto his head and demanded he begs her, effectively having Juzo under her complete control. He agreed to fulfill his end of the agreement and she released her hold. She then left the school grounds, the Reserve Course students trailing behind her, shielding herself from the rain with an umbrella. She stated that Juzo was only the 'appetizer' in her plan and that she had no further use for him. When Chiaki was forced down a lift by Chisa, she found herself in an underground corridor, with Junko addressing her from a monitor. She explained that she brainwashed Chisa by making her watch the despair video, which was possible through Ryota's animation techniques. Junko continued by saying that she had been watching Chiaki and knew she was the final piece in her plan to make her entire class fall into despair. Junko announced to Class 77-B through several monitors that Chiaki's ""punishment"" was now officially going to begin after trapping them in a room that would come to resemble those used in theClass Trials. A door opened and Chiaki was forced into a harrowing gauntlet full of dangerous traps. Junko monitored her progress, treating Chiaki's punishment as a virtual game, and commentated on her movements. Despite taking multiple injuries, she refused to give up, prompting Junko to reward her with a ten-second head start before the next wave of torture. Junko began counting down as Chiaki desperately tried to limp to safety, only to be speared in her right knee when Junko reached the six-second mark—a cruel fake-out that Junko mockingly attributed to ""a despairingly bad memory"". Chiaki defiantly told Junko that she wouldn't let her win over her and her friends as she finally made it to a door marked ""GOAL""—on the other side, she saw what appeared to be Chisa and her classmates. Chiaki eagerly moved toward them, only to be impaled by a spear as the illusion broke. Falling backward, she was caught in a bed of spears that shot out of the ground, impaling her entire body before she dropped lifelessly. The death of Chiaki forced the Class 77-B into despair and Junko's plan was now complete. Mukuro, Junko, and Izuru stood atop a tall building near the school, with a clear view of Class 77-B's room. Junko watched the class through her binoculars before proclaiming that they would infect the world with despair. Mukuro asked her what she meant by ""infect"", but was promptly silenced as Junko scolded her for not knowing her plan. Junko immediately slapped her, causing Mukuro to fall to the ground. Prodding Mukuro with her stiletto heel, Junko explained that an 'ominous' and 'fun' atmosphere had caused a hopeful world to fall into despair. Once the Reserve Students had finished their march on Hope's Peak, leaving it in ruin, Junko thanked them over her mobile phone, prompting them to adhere to her wishes by committing suicide. Mukuro inquired as to why she didn't keep them around to help but was rebuffed by Junko, who explained that although they thought like her, they were nowhere near the same level of ability and so were useless to her. Mukuro agreed while staring at her in admiration, her loyalty undimmed even when Junko pointed out that Mukuro may not be safe from her either should she let her guard down. Later, Junko and Mukuro were with Class 78th helping them to convert the academy into a bunker to protect the surviving students from the chaos outside. As the students worked, Junko threw a wrench at Makoto Naegi, only for it to fly over his head as he conveniently tripped. Junko explained to Mukuro that Makoto was the only person who she could not predict; nonetheless, she shot down her sister's suggestion that they kill him, believing that it would be more despair-inducing if someone like Makoto was able to beat her in the end."
Who was Junko's ally in preparation for the Mutual Killing of 78th Class?,Yasuke,Danganronpa zero,"Afterthe Tragedy of Hope's Peak Academy, Junko spread rumors about it, claiming that Izuru Kamukura was the culprit. Yasuke was asked by the school to interrogate her, but in reality, he was Junko's ally. In preparation for the Mutual Killing of 78th Class, Junko tested procedures for memory-erasing with the reluctant assistance of Yasuke. Having succeeded in erasing her own memories with Yasuke's memory-erasing technology, she assumed the fake identity ofRyoko Otonashiand hid from suspicion. As she no longer remembered who she was, she only had false information in a notebook and the continual deception by both Yasuke and Mukuro to go off on. Around the same time, the school board members were killed one by one by Mukuro. Eventually, she managed to recover all of her lost memories and she killed Yasuke in a fit of despair. Afterwards, Junko returned to her school life and continued preparations for the 78th Class' Mutual Killing along with Mukuro."
"What did Monaca Towa, Nagisa Shingetsu, Kotoko Utsugi, Masaru Daimon, and Jataro Kemuri call themselves?",Warriors of Hope,The warriors of hope,"Around the time when The Tragedy was beginning, five abused kids from Hope's Peak Elementary School called Monaca Towa,Nagisa Shingetsu,Kotoko Utsugi,Masaru Daimon, andJataro Kemuriwere about to commit suicide. However, Junko stopped them and took them under her wing, convincing them that the adults who abused them were wrong. Junko manipulated and brainwashed the children, giving them their first true hope and acting loving towards them. She made them think that they're her property. However, in truth, she was only interested in Monaca, who as a member of the Towa Group mass-produced extremely dangerous Monokuma robots for Junko. Furthermore, Junko decided to use the children to cause more despair and taught them that all the adults are Demons who need to be killed. The children started to call themselves the Warriors of Hope. The kids seemingly were loving towards Junko as well, but as later revealed inDanganronpa: Another Episode, Monaca was the only one who was ultimately loving towards her, often referring to her as ""Big Sis Junko""."
What did Junko's classmates do for a year without knowing that the Ultimate Despair members were already in their midst? Available choices: (A). They sealed Hope's Peak Academy; (B). They sealed Hope's Peak Academy; (C). They sealed Hope's Peak Academy; (D). They sealed Hope's Peak Academy;,(A).,During the tragedy,"At Junko's behest, all the Reserve Students committed mass suicide, furthering the message of despair. The riots spread outside the school, both online and off, and slowly became more violent and destructive as more and more people succumbed to despair. Wars started and soon the whole world fell into despair. The whole incident was known as The Tragedy. The Ultimate Despair members worshiped Junko and spread all over the world to cause terrible things for the sake of despair. They even killed their friends and families. The Warriors of Hope started to kill adults, even their parents, in order to create a paradise for children. Junko's classmates, the Class 78th, sealed Hope's Peak Academy and lived peacefully inside it for a year without knowing that the Ultimate Despair members were already in their midst. Junko incapacitated them somehow, executed the headmaster Jin Kirigiri, and erased her classmates' memories."
How many students did Junko kill?,sixteen,Danganronpa: trigger happy havoc,"Junko starts the Mutual Killing Game of Class 78th and speaks to her classmates through a smaller version of Monokuma, hiding her true identity. She worked behind the scenes and controlled Monokuma in order to cause anxiety and paranoia among the students to make them kill each other. She also began to broadcast everything as a TV program for the public to enjoy and fall into despair. Mukuro posed among the students as Junko herself and the original plan was to have her trapped in the dungeon in order to ""set an example"" for the students not to directly rebel against Monokuma. However, on a whim, Junko decided to kill her sister for real and she was brutally impaled by Monokuma with numerous spears, dubbed ""Spears of Gungnir"". The reason Junko killed Mukuro was to bring her and her sister despair since beyond all appearances she truly did love Mukuro. Despite this, the survivors of the Killing School Life took it as plain murder. All of the students then believed that Junko had died, not knowing that the Junko they knew was an impostor because at the time the students were not privy to the fact that there were actually sixteen students. After the class trial, Kyoko told Makoto that she had found a hidden room containing secret documents about Hope's Peak Academy, accessed through the supply closet of the second-floor men's restroom. After Makoto entered this room, a masked Junko knocked him out from behind. When he woke up, all of the files were gone. During the course of events, Junko was able to ensure the deaths of several of the students, before realizing thatKyoko Kirigirihad somehow managed to break into the headmaster's office and steal the master key and part of Mukuro's profiled information. She then decided to break her own rules and stage a murder by using Mukuro's body. Junko almost succeeded in her attempt to kill Makoto and frame Kyoko, but was ultimately fruitless when Kyoko saved Makoto just as she was about to stab him, and then by Makoto not calling out Kyoko's lie during theClass Trialwhen Kyoko announced that she would not have been able to access her own room. With Kyoko's lie not called out, a frustrated Junko had no choice but to call guilt on Makoto, who remained under unconvincing suspicion throughout the trial, however, Junko's plans to execute Makoto were thwarted byAlter Egowho had stopped theexecutionin time for Makoto to evade death. She taunted the students, still, despite the setback, and proclaimed that even if Makoto survived the execution he would eventually rot inside the school garbage dump, making his punishment worse than usual, despite her preferences on executions. Junko had not counted on Kyoko jumping into the rubbish chute to save him and was properly thwarted when both Kyoko and Makoto showed up at the gymnasium to issue an ultimatum. She was forced to accept that a retrial is necessary, but then Junko — still in Monokuma form — decided to gradually reveal the whole truth to the students, confident that even if she was exposed, they would not be able to handle the shock of the outside world they longed to go back to having already “ended” due to The Tragedy. During the final Class Trial, Makoto and Kyoko deduce that Junko was the one pulling the strings the entire time and she was revealed to be the mastermind behind everything at the Academy. She then confirmed the suspicion - one that emerged from the intense Class Trial debates - that she erased everyone's memories of the last two years so she could implement her plan to make the world suffer in despair. Junko then put a trial together to have the students vote for the abstract ideas of “hope” versus “despair”, where all but Makoto would live their lives out within the confines of the Academy and if a single student voted for ""despair"" Makoto alone would suffer a huge punishment, meaning he would have been subjected toThe Ultimate Punishment. However, Makoto reassured the surviving students of a future ahead despite the difficulties and thus was able to convince all the students to vote for “Hope”, condemning Junko to a final defeat in the climax of aBullet Time Battleof “Hope” versus “Despair”. Though seemingly livid over the results shortly after the vote was settled, Junko instead became perversely delighted as she tasted her own despair for once. She delightfully accepted her execution and death, but not before giving the remaining students the means to escape the Academy. It was also noted she was feeling the tiniest bit down because she had wanted to spread the despair she was feeling to the entire world."
What did Junko do when she tried to kill Mukuro?,tried to murder her sister with an ice pick and a grenade while in a limo,Mukuro ikusaba,"Mukuro is Junko's older twin sister. While Mukuro cared deeply for her younger sister, Junko appeared to have no love for her sister, seeing her as a tool to do her bidding, while at the same time behaved towards Mukuro in a derogatory manner. Whenever Mukuro talked fondly of Junko, she yelled at her and told her she's being gross. She frequently called her a dumb muscle who is only good for killing and mocked Mukuro whenever she showed interest in anything else . Furthermore, she frequently insulted Mukuro's looks and intelligence, considering herself superior in every way. Junko seemingly displayed no concern for Mukuro and was willing to kill her to set an example to the remaining students, and because she was 'a poor actor'. It's revealed that before attending Hope's Peak Academy, Junko had already tried to kill Mukuro. One example of this is when Junko tried to murder her sister with an ice pick and a grenade while in a limo. Mukuro, however, did not allow her to do this, blocked Junko's attacks, and threw the grenade out the window. InDanganronpa V3: Killing Harmony's non-canon bonus modeUltimate Talent Development Plan, Junko throws knives at Mukuro when they meet, indicating that this is some sort of twisted habit between the two that they do whenever they see each other after a while. Junko is also seen being physically abusive towards Mukuro on several occasions, often hitting and kicking her, though Mukuro sometimes seems to enjoy this. InDanganronpa ZeroandDanganronpa 3, it's indicated that Mukuro may have incestuous feelings towards her sister, but Junko does not appear to be aware of this or just doesn't care. However, paradoxically, it was also indicated that Junko did truly love her sister and that all of her horrible treatment of her was to make her feel despair, which Junko considered to be a loving act. The betrayal and murder of her was meant to send them both into despair . However, Junko never knew or tried to understand, that Mukuro's definition of despair had always differed from hers."
How did Yasuke feel when he met Junko?,depressed and introverted,Yasuke matsuda,"Yasuke and Junko were childhood friends who met on amicable terms when Yasuke's unnamed mother was struck with a disease, implied to be Alzheimer's, causing her to lose recognition of her son, resulting in Yasuke being neglected and abused as a child, which later made him majorly depressed and introverted before he met Junko in elementary school. One particular moment between the two when they were children was when Junko spent many days building a very detailed sandcastle. One day, the sandcastle was found destroyed. Yasuke went around angrily looking for the perpetrator until Junko approached him and stated that she had destroyed the sandcastle on her own accord and not to tell anyone. In the years following the death of Yasuke's mother, Junko became the person that Yasuke felt he could always lean on, since he didn't have any other close friends. She promised to always be there for him, which made him develop stronger feelings towards her. She said she'll never forget Yasuke even if she forgets everything else, and that they'll always be together. For the first time in his life, Yasuke cried in front of another person, after making her promise she won't make fun of him, won't tell anyone, and won't try to console him. He became dependent on her and was ready to do anything for her because she told him she'll be what's important to him for now and prevented him from being all alone when he needed it the most. Junko also had a tendency to call them ""lovers"" and had romantic feelings for Yasuke, but he denied this with annoyance and called her a ""stalker"", treating her very similarly to Ryoko later in life. Yasuke has described Junko as ""not family, a lover, or even a friend ... but someone just as important to him as any of those"". Both of them later enrolled in Hope's Peak Academy and after the school's tragedy, Yasuke reluctantly assisted Junko in her plans, creating her alternative identity Ryoko Otonashi. He wanted to prevent her from ever remembering, in order to protect her from herself and to protect other people. However, Junko had already planned ahead and had murders occur in the school. Despite not enjoying despair and killing, Yasuke was willing to do unethical things for the sake of protecting Junko, even if it caused him to feel horrible guilt. Finally, Yasuke understands and admits to himself that Junko has only been using him. He is frustrated by her love for despair and angered after assuming that she never cared about him. He states that he both loves and hates her. He eventually decides to kill her while she is still Ryoko, however, he ends up getting killed instead. Junko stabbed him in the side and kicked his body until he was bloody and unrecognizable. He died believing that Junko did not care about him at all, but in truth, this was not the case. Junko did not view him as a servant and truly loved him, saying “you were the most important person to me of all” after he died, but killing him resulted in her feeling despair, which she so desperately craved. Class 78th:"
What does Junko do after he foils Makoto's attempt to execute Kyoko?,executes herself,Makoto naegi,"From the moment she first saw Makoto, she knew he would cause problems for her, due to him and his luck being unpredictable and for the same motive, Junko leaves Makoto alive because he's the only one who can defy her. Out of all of the students in Class 78th, she finds him the most annoying and odd person in her class. During the Killing School Life, Makoto foils Junko's attempt to execute Kyoko then Junko attempted to convince the other survivors to execute Makoto but instead they vote to execute her. Makoto states that she doesn't need to die, but Junko executes herself even after his request."
How did Junko treat Mikan?,"physically and verbally abused Mikan, kicking her and calling her disgusting",Mikan tsumiki,"Mikan was the first person in Class 77-B Junko brainwashed. Junko didn't actually care for her, wishing only to throw her into despair ; however, the effects of her brainwashing caused Mikan to worship her, doing anything Junko asked. Much like her sister, Junko physically and verbally abused Mikan, kicking her and calling her disgusting. She also seems to treat her like a servant, as Mikan is seen massaging her legs. Mikan refers to Junko as the only person who truly loved and paid attention to her, but Junko never viewed Mikan as anything more than a tool and never felt any love towards her."
What was Junko's relationship with the homeroom teacher of Class 77-B? Available choices: (A). None of the above choices. (B). She tried to protect her students from her. (C). She subdued and brainwashed her with the help of Mukuro. (D). She subdued and brainwashed her with the help of Mukuro.,(C).,Chisa yukizome,"Junko had a somewhat complicated relationship with the homeroom teacher of Class 77-B. When Chisa learned that Junko was responsible for the recent events at Hope's Peak, she tried to protect her students from her, ultimately failing when Junko subdued and brainwashed her with the help of Mukuro. Even after being brainwashed, Chisa didn't harbor the same feelings that most of the Ultimate Despair held for Junko. She didn't love or admire her, and instead of bringing despair to the world, she brought it only to Kyosuke and the Future Foundation. Junko's feelings towards Chisa are unknown, but she seems to view Chisa as more than a tool to do her bidding; Junko is seen personally talking to Chisa in the afterlife, laughing at how much Chisa had accomplished as an Ultimate Despair. However, Chisa actually seems quite annoyed with Junko, frowning while she continues to talk about despair."
"What did Juzo do after confronting Junko on Kyosuke's behalf? A: She blackmailed him, threatening to show Kyosuke photos of Juzo showing love for him in private. B: She blackmailed him, threatening to show Kyosuke photos of Juzo showing love for him in private. C: She blackmailed him, threatening to show Kyosuke photos of Juzo showing love for him in private. D: She blackmailed him, threatening to show Kyosuke photos of Juzo showing love for him in private.",A,Juzo sakakura,"Juzo holds a deep grudge against Junko for both causing him to betray Kyosuke and starting the Tragedy. When Juzo confronted Junko on Kyosuke's behalf, Junko managed to overpower him in a physical fight . She continued by blackmailing him, threatening to show Kyosuke photos of Juzo showing love for him in private. Junko found the whole situation hilarious, and called Juzo weak, saying she had no more time to waste on someone like him. Junko seems to have close relationships with some of the Ultimate Despair members, though she likely fabricated those relationships to increase their loyalty to her and bring them deeper into despair. In general, they're described to be madly in love with her and shared her love for despair as a result of Junko's brainwashing. A few examples of this are Mikan Tsumiki and Nagito Komaeda, although Izuru seems to be the exception. Besides that, Junko doesn't care about any of them - except to Mukuro and Izuru - considering them pawns to achieve her goals."
What does Junko do when she triggers the first Hope's Peak killing game?,She brings Izuru along with her,Izuru kamukura,"At first Junko seemed to have an underlying obsession/love towards Izuru, possibly because he is the Ultimate Hope and attempted to kill him because of his title. After realizing both her and Mukuro couldn't defeat him, she instead tried to convert Izuru into a member of the Ultimate Despair. She brings Izuru along with her when she triggers the first Hope's Peak killing game and she frames Izuru to show him what despair was and eventually convinced him that a world of hope was boring. Izuru once protected Junko from Nagito after he attempts to kill her with a gun, showing that he was on Junko's side. In theDanganronpa 3relationship chart, Junko states that Izuru is a fateful encounter. She believed that she and him were destined for each other and a perfect match for spreading despair together, occasionally acting like an overly enthusiastic fan and flirting with him in a joking manner, though he is completely unresponsive and uninterested to this. Unusually, she also seemed to treat Izuru as an ally instead of her servant, and she was irritated when Izuru walked away without saying a proper goodbye. She appears to have some genuine attraction towards him, as she is seen blushing and looking at him in an adoring manner after he shot Nagito and thus saved her life. In the end, neither of the two truly cared about each other and were only using each other—Izuru was just affiliated with her to see how unpredictable despair is, while Junko saw him as a tool in her hand, stating that she'll always find a use for him. In Chapter 0 ofDanganronpa 2, Izuru acknowledges that Junko used him in the past and seems to desire for revenge, as he wants to use her as she used him. He is shown to possess unusual hatred towards her, now considering her an enemy, possibly due to subconscious anger towards her actions.Danganronpa 3reveals that Izuru was actually manipulating events after The Tragedy to strengthen both sides of the conflict, setting up a scenario where Junko's despair could clash with the Future Foundation's hope in order to determine which truly was stronger."
Who did Monaca see as her savior and idol after she stopped the Warriors of Hope before they committed suicide together?,Junko,Monaca towa,"Monaca sees Junko as her savior and idol after she stopped the Warriors of Hope before they committed suicide together. Junko planned to use the Warriors of Hope as one of her pawns to spread despair to the world. Junko appears to be the only person Monaca genuinely cared about. She was the only Warrior of Hope who knew that Junko was just using them, but she didn't care, as she was so grateful for Junko for ""shining light into her boring world"". Monaca also has many pictures of Junko in her secret room. One main photo depicts her with a younger-looking Junko holding onto her wheelchair. Despite their closeness, even Junko didn't seem to know that she was only faking her disability. Not wanting Junko's legacy to end, Monaca's main goal was to create a second-generation Junko Enoshima. She planned to become her successor herself based on the Servant's advice but ended up giving up on this goal after she realized that she didn't want to become like him, completely obsessed with hope and despair."

What does Maka wear when she joins Spartoi?,black tights and the classic white Spartoi shoes,Appearance,"Maka is a flat-chested, teenage young woman with light taupe hair which she keeps in pigtails, although there are certain times she may stylize them into buns or wear them straight down. Maka's primary outfit is a typical schoolgirl outfit consisting of a white blouse with a yellow sweater vest, a green striped tie, a red plaid skirt, and black boots with white buckles. When using Soul, she usually wears white gloves. Maka also wears a trench coat with a cloak-like end . In her initial appearance in the first chapter, her trench coat was so long that, when buttoned up, it seemed that she was not wearing a skirt.[16][40] When Maka joins Spartoi, her outfit changes, though it still shows similarities to her previous attire. Maka's Spartoi uniform is very similar to that of a Japanese schoolgirl's sailor uniform with the colouring of the classic Spartoi uniform: a white blouse attached with a blue sailor-style collar with a red necktie that has a pink coiled tip and a short, blue, pleated skirt. Alongside this uniform, Maka wears black tights and the classic white Spartoi shoes, but stops wearing tights a few chapters later. Like her previous outfit, Maka wears a long trench coat, though it is white instead of black and has the Spartoi logo on the left shoulder as well as the fact that the cloak end splits in two. Her pigtails are fashioned using skull hairbands similar toShinigami'smask. She also still wears white gloves. Maka's soul, when viewed by Stein, has an orange-like colour and has her signature pigtails.[41]Some comments from Ragnarok and Maka herself suggest that Maka's soul is quite small, especially when compared to those of others, such as Black☆Star's . When resonating with Soul, these ""ponytails"" turn into wings, revealing her soul to be aGrigori Soul, and her Soul Wavelength takes on the form of feathers. In the last chapter inthe Book of Eibon, Maka is transformed into a boy, having switched genders like the other members of Spartoi. Out of all the characters, apart fromPot of FireandPot of Thunder, she changes the least in appearance. She has shorter hair and wears a suit, complete with the usual gloves."
What is the name of Maka's partner?,Soul,Special abilities,"Maka attacking Crona with a demon scythe. Scythe Handling Skills: A weapons expert in the usage of a scythe, Maka acts as a extraordinary scythe-meister whose skill allowed her to be recognized as one of the topone-starmeisters ofDeath Weapon Meister Academy[51]and later be promoted to atwo-starstatus.[52]While her initial scythe-handling skill came in most from her own and Soul's partnership rather than simply her own skill, it seems Maka no longer needs to rely on Soul to do much of the spinning and work. During her fight with Crona, she used her father's demon scythe form against the latter, showing great skill as she spin and twirl the scythe even from her legs.[53]Her skill with a scythe also makes her capable of using Tsubaki'sChain Scythe weapon form.[54] Anti-Demon Wavelength: Maka possess a special wavelength that acts as a bane against dark forces such as magic,demons, and even likelyimmortals.[55]This wavelength also allows her to utilize enhanced forms of theWitch-Hunt[56], allows her immunity to certain magics likeArachne's magic, direct influence from theblack blood, and madness to an extent.[57]She can voluntarily transfer this wavelength to her partner,[58]to others on her own with physical contact,[59]or throughSoul's piano.[60] Grigori: Maka possess a rare soul type in which allows for flight. To enable this ability, she requires the usage of aDeath's Weaponto utilizeadvanced magical-like powers.[61]By being on the same page with partner duringsoul resonance, she can manifest wings onto her weapon form.[62] Wavelength Control: As a Meister, Maka has some skill in controlling her wavelength and can perform specialized techniques.[10] High Physical Abilities: A trained meister, has an excellent level of athletic ability in which surpasses Soul.[63]She was also able to run 100 meters in 8.92 seconds.[64]Her athletic ability was renowned enough to be compared toPatty Thompsonwhen she showed amazing physical ability herself.[65]Maka is a also surprisingly durable individual able to withstand Crona'sScreech Alpha,[66]punishment fromFreeeven after the later even slammed her with hisIce Shackle Bulletspell and overpowered her with his own martial arts and physical abilities as was still able to fight.[67]She was also able to takeArachne's hits within her disembodied from[68] Maka strikes Crona barehanded. Hand-to-Hand Combat: Maka possess proficient ability in unarmed hand-to-hand combat, often punishing her weapon's antics with jump kicks to him when angered[69]and mix in both kicks and punches during her battles with her chosen weapon on hand.[70]Her skill and usage in with her unarmed skills alone seemingly overwhelms Crona If not for the latter's ownblack blood.[71] Danger Sense: Maka has the ability to ominously sense danger in which may be far too much for her to handle. She displayed this ability only once prior to her meeting Crona for the first time, in which eventually led to her first defeat and was nearly killed.[72] Cooking: Maka possess some proficiency in cooking enough to make at least a decent breakfast for both her and Soul.[73]"
What chapter of the Book of Eibon did Maka admit that she's not as strong as either BlackStar or Death the Kid?,Sloth Chapter,Weaknesses,"Although a immensely skilled Scythe-Meister of her own, Maka herself suffers from a variety of weaknesses. While proficient in her hand-to-hand combat, her skill in such area is not onBlack☆Star's level and even incurred an embarrassing moment from the assassin much to her dismay at the time.[74]In addition, it seems that evenPatty Thompsonsurpasses her ability according toOx FordandHarvar D. Éclair.[65]In the Envy chapter, it's even revealed that the chapter's projections of her insecurities point out Maka feels she's even weaker then Patty despite the latter being a Demon Weapon and harbors some level of jealousy towards it.[75] Maka's improper skill in Scythe-Handling was poor to the point she couldn't twirl a broom on her own. Without the assistance of Soul, her capabilities diminish greatly and she's even aware of such a fact and have exaggeratedly stated that without Soul she can't do anything and both of them use each other to get stronger.[76]While in the Sloth Chapter of theBook of Eibon, even she admitted that she's not as strong as either Black☆Star or Death the Kid and as shown in the Sloth chapter, she's aware of this to the point she was affected by the chapter itself and felt she was only a burden to her weapon partner.[77]Needless to say, another addition insecurity was her Scythe-Handling skill, in which were unrefined and couldn't even twirl a mop and was another insecurity and felt that If she didn't practice that Soul would leave her for another Meister partner.[78] This weakness no longer applies, however, as she seem to have put in practice and showncase the ability to twirl a Scythe weapon while using her father's weapon form againstCrona.[79] Maka is overwhelmed by an opponent who has a lot of ""direct power"", unlike those like Arachne. Maka herself also has her own limits and has met her match a variety of times. In her first duel with Crona, she not only lost but witnessed her weapon partner badly injured.[80]She also found thatFranken Steinwas far out of her league and even saw his soul and became afraid of him to the point she nearly broke down in fear.[81]During the previous year in theDeath Festivaltournament, it's revealed that she has lost toBlack☆Starthe year before[82]She also was no match for bothMosquitoin his100 Years Agoand required Soul's Piano to and a Chain Resonance [83]norGiriko, in which not only nearly had her killed[84]but even revealed that she has a variety of issues facing an opponent who's abilities allows them to have a lot of ""direct power"".[85]She was also outclassed by Free in his werewolf form, with her citing his physical abilities were incredible even.[86]Even at her max, she was not only no match for the Kishin and was pinned by the god,[87]but even claimed herself that without the aid of Death the Kid and Black☆Star, she wouldn't even land a single blow on the Kishin by herself.[88] Maka also has been criticized by many of her opponents to lack raw power herself, with bothCronaandRagnarokconsider both her and even her weapon partner to be ""weak"", with Ragnarok going far enough to say she's a ""small fry"" and looks less tasteless compared to the likes of Black☆Star.[89]Even the assassin himself, when he was angry at Maka, cockily stated that he wouldn't ever ""suck that bad"" like Maka after flipping her over.[90]Asura himself also held a very low opinion of her, calling her ""human scum"" and felt the need to make her ""learn her manners"".[91]"

Along with everyone else, Maka declines and prepares herself, changing from her dress to her usual uniform, donning her trench coat."
Where does Soul meet with Soul?,the Black Room,A fight to the death at the anniversary celebration arc,"Whilst on the way to stop Medusa, Maka senses a Wavelength that deeply disturbs her: that of her father. Spirit joins the group after he had also escaped from Free's Spatial Magic, much to Maka's annoyance. They soon encounter Medusa. Black☆Star and Death the Kid, with their partners, run past Medusa. Maka also does so, by taking a risky path right through the blind spot of Medusa'sattacks. She manages to pass through, and Stein stays behind with Spirit to battle Medusa. Maka and Soul soon catch up with Black☆Star and Tsubaki, who are about to battle Crona. Although Stein had told Black☆Star and Tsubaki to fight Crona, Maka disobeys orders and tells Black☆Star to go on as she will fight Crona to avenge Soul. She expresses more confidence in the battle, and manages to aggravate Crona, and tells Ragnarok after he insults her that she is pleased that he is now treating her as an enemy rather than a meal. However, Crona still proves to be more powerful than her, countering her Witch Hunt withScreech Alpha. After seeing Crona gain the upper hand in their fight, Maka overhears Soul and Little Ogre and meets with Soul inthe Black Room. Soul, shocked, thinks she is only a mere illusion that Little Ogre had created, but a Maka Chop from her shows him that she is real, and that they can converse to each other because their souls are in Resonance. The two dance together in the Black Room, and Maka tells him that she had heard Little Ogre after the Black Blood had temporarily infected her during the fight against Free, and urges him to accept his bargain for power when it appears to be their only chance of victory during their second battle against Crona. She tells him that she might gain more understanding of Crona's Soul Wavelength if she falls into the same sort ofmadnessas it. Soul appears reluctant, but he finally agrees, promising Maka that he will bring her back no matter how deep she sinks into madness. During this battle, the Black Blood causes Maka to fall into a crazed state of delirium, while Soul Eater holds on to both of their sanities, drowning in the darkness he refers to as madness. Because of the Black Blood hardening within her body, she is able to gain an immunity against slash and crush attacks and also acquires superior strength, quickly overpowering Crona. While in this state, Maka is not only quite crazy but also quite silly, as her movements, behavior, and her fighting style change drastically, and she resembles a state of inebriation. Her drastic behavior is clearly indicated by her swaying, constant giggling, and attempt to devour Crona's head. The true Maka is embarrassed by her actions, but Soul reassures her that her current state is no different as to how she usually acts. Soul tells her to quickly find Crona's soul. After passing by her own soul and her partner's soul, she sees Crona's soul. Whilst her physical self is crazily attacking them, her mental self manages to see into Crona's soul. Later in their fight, she begins to understand Crona's soul and realizes that Crona has always lacked any sort of close relationship with anyone, not even with their mother, Medusa. As Soul manages to pull her out of the madness, Maka puts Soul aside, much to his surprise, walks calmly through Crona'sBloody Needleattacks and embraces Crona, subduing them and stopping their rampage. Their fight ends with Maka asking to become Crona's friend. Crona starts to cry and decides to help Maka. Ragnarok, however, is displeased, and attacks Maka, which Soul and Crona try to prevent. Maka and Soul leave them behind to deal with the furious Ragnarok and help Black☆Star and the others stop the release of the Kishin. On the way, Soul is concerned for Maka's wounds she had received, but Maka realizes that the Black Blood had healed them. However, she sees that her Black Blood is no longer in her body, and wonders why. However, she has no time to think as she senses Asura being released. She rushes to stop Asura. Despite her effort Asura is still released, but Maka still tries to stop him, grabbing one of his skin scarves and using Soul to try and slow him down. However, when Asura emerges above Death City, some falling debris hits her and she is left falling towards Death City. Luckily, Soul cushions the blow, probably saving her life. Maka still briefly tries to go after Asura, but loses consciousness. After Asura escapes, Soul carries her through the ruined Death City. Maka is cooped up in her and Soul's apartment, worrying over Crona. Soul, in order to give her some fresh air, drags a reluctant Maka outside . She ends up persuaded to play basketball with Soul, Black☆Star, Tsubaki, Patti and Death the Kid, with the excuse that they are missing one player . To make the game more interesting, Soul brings up the idea of a bet for each of the teams' respective captain to follow if they lose. If Kid's team loses, they will put the paintings on Kid's walls in his mansion off by 1 in; if Maka's team loses, she has to go shopping with her father. Ultimately, Kid's team wins, since Maka, having never played basketball, easily loses as she does not know the rules. Maka reluctantly asks her father to go shopping with her, and Spirit ends up vomiting out of happiness and suprise, much to her shock."
What is the name of the man who promises to tell them about the incident involving the Oldest Golem?,Sou,Trial enrollment arc,"Maka visits Crona on the day of their first day at the DWMA after asking Sid for permission, as the zombie fails to coax Crona out of their room. Maka enters Crona's room to get them out. After a shaky start as Maka gives Crona a Maka Chop by accident after aiming for Ragnarok, who had flipped her skirt, she and Marie coax them out and show them around the Academy. They are met by Soul, who asks Crona how they feel about the DWMA. However, Crona, depressed, seems fully convinced that they will never fit in. To cheer them up, Maka proposes that Crona write a poem to express themselves, which is met immediately with scorn by Soul . However,Crona's poemends up being so depressing that Maka, Marie, Soul, and even Black☆Star end up getting depressed with them and sitting in a corner. Later on, Maka, Soul and Crona are sent on a mission toLoew Villagein the Czech Republic after an incident involving theOldest Golem. There, the gang ask around about the event with no results. Their arrival seems to attract hostility from the villagers. They soon meet a man named Sou who promises to tell them about the incident. While following Sou, Soul expresses his suspicions about him, and indeed, the group are soon attacked by the Oldest Golem. Maka quickly notices the Golem has a Soul Wavelength, despite the fact that Golems do not have souls. At this point, the man named Sou reveals himself to beGirikoand transforms into his Weapon form and partners with the Oldest Golem. The Golem goes after Maka and Soul and quickly overwhelms them. Maka then convinces Ragnarok and Crona into helping her. With that, the two team up and battle the enemy. Maka manages to get through the Golem's guard, cut the Golem and, immediately after dealing the strike, a large amount of spider webs shoot out of the opening and paralyze her. This forces Crona to defend her when the Golem strikes. Soul watches over the paralyzed Maka. Maka then watches numerous spiders congregate and form into the WitchArachne. Arachne reveals that she had been surveying the world for hundreds of years through the eyes of many spiders. She proves this by referring to Soul and Maka by name and identifying Crona as Medusa's child. The battle soon seems hopeless, as Crona is overwhelmed by Giriko, who is ordered by Arachne to kill them. Before Crona can be beheaded,Justin Lawmakes it in time to prevent it. Maka, along with Soul, watches the battle between Justin and Giriko. She expresses her awe at both of the Weapons' power. When Giriko escapes with Arachne, Justin fights against the Oldest Golem and beheads it with hisLaw Abiding Silver Gun. After defeating it, he orders everyone to pray for it. As Maka closes her eyes, she hears Soul curse to himself about being too weak to fight for Maka like Justin and Giriko, and gives him a concerned look. After Justin defeats the golem, he carries the paralyzed Maka off inside the coffin attached to his dune buggy. Maka is annoyed as everyone pretends to ignore her, and sympathizes with Sid as she finds herself covered in flowers in a coffin."
What does Soul play when Maka asks Soul to play the piano?,karaoke,Reunion express arc,"Maka recovers from her condition and is seen in Stein's class as he is about to start a lesson. The group discuss on how Black☆Star had been picking a lot of fights recently with the other students. However, Stein, much to everyone’s shock, throws a scalpel in their direction and tells them to focus on the lesson. Black☆Star arrives late and is told to stand outside for the time being. The lesson is about Duel Art and he plans to teach the class by using Black☆Star, Maka and Soul, and Ox andHarvarto work together to fight against himself. As Black☆Star is told to re-enter the classroom, Maka wonders why he is so out of breath; turns out that he had been training whilst outside. During the battle, Black☆Star is subject to many accidental assaults via both Ox and Maka, with Ox accounting for the lion's share of the assaults. Maka ends up being electrocuted by Ox'sLightning Kingalong with Black☆Star and then watches the angered Black☆Star challenge and defeat Ox for his actions. She comments that this adds to the number of battles won by Black☆Star in a row, and Black☆Star tells her not to include Ox in his total. Overall, the lesson is a failure. Maka is seen at a party with all her other friends thrown in celebration for her recovery. She comforts Crona with everyone else, who is still getting used to having people around him. When Maka asks Soul to play the piano, he refuses and goes to the bathroom. When Liz asks what kind of songs he plays, Maka replies that Soul plays really dark and strange songs. When the party ends, the group splits up. The group again try to make Soul play the piano for them. Their efforts still remain fruitless. Soul tells everyone that his songs are not worth listening too. Maka objects, telling him that she had liked the song Soul had played for her once. Soul, frustrated for some reason, tells her that she only likes his music because of her low Musical IQ. Maka defends her love of, 'The Pon Poko Dance,' which is immediately made fun of by the others. She attempts to bring Crona into the conversation, but they quickly retreat and excuse themselves. Maka wonders about their strange behavior. WitnessingHirobeing bullied around by the other students, she sympathetically comments that Hiro would have been more popular if he went to a normal school, since he is too shabby here at the DWMA."
Who visits Maka?,BlackStar,"""brew"" - the tempest arc","Black☆Star joins Maka and Kid and their partners outside to practice their Chain Resonance. Stein warns them that if they do not succeed, then they will be removed from his class. With this said, Maka warns Black☆Star in particular to do this properly, but he insists that he always does. Despite this, the three students fail multiple times, which angers Maka. She believes that Black☆Star is the blight of the failures. She starts arguing with him, but Kid steps in between them, and Stein decides to give them a break to cool down. Maka confronts Stein with the purpose of removing Black☆Star from the team. She fails at this and returns to the group. Black☆Star then accuses her of tattling to Stein and being selfish. This infuriates Maka, bringing her to try to punch him, but fails. Kid tries to diffuse the situation, but Soul steps in and tells him to leave the two to sort it out on their own. Maka tries to punch him again, and this time, Black☆Star allows her to hit him. Black☆Star then warns Maka that, if this goes on any further, it sould be a duel, and he would be sure to crush her. With that said Maka curses at the top of her lungs and runs off in tears. On her own, Maka secretly talks of her envy of Black☆Star and how he can become so strong without being concerned about anything around him. She is soon visited by Tsubaki. She asks him what she thinks of Black☆Star. Maka replies simply by saying that he ticks her off. Tsubaki pauses, before saying that Black☆Star actually does study before tests, which surprises Maka as he always gets zeroes. She asks Tsubaki why he never gets good grades, and Tsubaki admits that she does not know. Maka laments, saying that she will never understand Black☆Star if even Tsubaki cannot understand him. Tsubaki says that friends do not need to understand each other all the time. Realizing her mistake and on how to achieve a true Chain Resonance, Maka eagerly decides to return to the others, and Tsubaki wonders if it was necessary for her to come in the first place. However, Maka, on the way, panics, wondering on how to apologize. Tsubaki ends up dragging her, saying that she does not need to think about it since she will probably end up fighting with Black☆Star again. She is then met by Soul. She asks him if he had come to laugh at her, and Soul pauses before replying that the laughter should wait until after they had succeeded the Chain Resonance. Returning to the group, she apologizes to Black☆Star, who forgives her. The group resume their training and succeed, with Maka not trying to understand them, but putting her life in their hands and trusting them. Stein then makes Maka the leader of the group. Later that night as they are heading home, Maka lets Black☆Star hit her to make up for how she hit him earlier. To everyone's surprise, he ends up hitting her hard and, though apparently bruised after being sent flying, Maka smiles and says, 'Ouch.' aka, Kid, Black☆Star, Ox,Kirikou, andKimand theirrespectiveWeaponsare the group of kids chosen for fighting to obtain Brew, a powerful Demon Tool, beforeArachnophobia. The Demon Tool is located in a large magnetic field in the middle of theisland, which is harmful to the human body if one is there for too long. The students' job is to prevent Arachnophobia forces from entering the field whilstMarieand Stein go inside. If they do not return after twenty minutes, they are to retreat. Maka questions on this, saying that she does not want to leave Marie and Stein behind. Ox replies that if they go in the field, the enemies will follow and the battle will get out-of-hand, leading to people being lost because of staying in the field for too long. He questions Maka, saying if she deserves to be top of the class, a comment which hits Maka hard. When Stein and Marie, the duo responsible for retrieving Brew in the vortex of Lost Island, take too long to reappear, the group begins to worry. Ox, Kirikou, and Kim decide to stay behind and take care of the forces opposing them. With that, Maka, Black☆Star, and Kid enter the vortex. The first thing they notice is Death and that the vortex is a sort of frozen time anomaly repeatedly showing the events that led to the explosion on the island. Kid explains that what they see is Shinigami from the Grim Times, before he built the DWMA. The group then hurries to a temple. When they reach, they notice a large mass of Witches — one of them beingArachne. They hear Arachne speak about blowing up the island and everything relating to Brew. The group proceeds and soon meetMarieandStein. Because Marie and Stein are overstaying in the vortex, they are in danger of becoming a part of the time anomaly. Maka and the others tell them to retreat and decide that they will take on the mission of retrieving Brew. They eventually bump intoMosquito, carryingBrew. He then reverts to hisform from 100 years agoand prepares to battle them. Before the battle can start, though, a hologram ofEibonappears. Black☆Star decides not to waste time and attacks Mosquito, ignoring the presence of Eibon. Maka follows suit and, eventually, Kid brings himself to ignore Eibon and attacks Mosquito too. None of their attacks, however, are penetrating the tough hide of Mosquito. Mosquito then uses his immense strength to overpower the kids. Luckily, Soul comes up with the idea of Chain Resonance and augmenting it with his music. The group laugh as they hear he is going to play the piano in his soul. When Soul asks why they are laughing, Maka replies that they had finally got Soul to play the piano for them. Soul plays the piano, giving everyone a rush of power, enabling them to maneuver flawlessly around each other and link their attacks with ease. They are easily able to overcome Mosquito with both their speed and strength. Ultimately, their combined strength allows them to damage Mosquito and Kid manages to connect aDeath Cannon, and Black☆Star attacks with hisUncanny Sword, which destroys both of Mosquito's arms. Before they can finish him off, Soul stops playing, advising them to leave as their time limit for staying in the vortex is almost up. Maka protests, but has no choice but to agree. Since Mosquito can revert to an even younger form of himself, he can remain in the vortex for longer, and the group have no choice but to retreat without Brew.In the anime only, Maka continues on to activate theMajinHunt and bisects Mosquito horizontally, but he escapes by detaching his head from his body. Soul then tells everyone that it's time to leave. On their way out, they meet up with Kirikou and Ox, who help escort them out of the vortex. They leave and watch how the Witch's research facility is destroyed by an explosion, though that, too, is a hologram from years past. When they exit the vortex they are greeted by a distraught Marie, who makes a move to strike them, but instead hugs them all for making it out safe, but soon threatens that they will all have a talking with her back at the DWMA. Maka calls Shinigami and reports in on the failed mission. After doing so, she sits next to Soul on the boat that is bearing them back to the DWMA."
What is the name of the person who is talking to someone in an alleyway?,Crona,Internal investigation arc,"Maka is with Soul saying bye to Crona as they head home. While walking, Maka remembers that she had left her notebook in the classroom and turns back to retrieve it. On her way, she notices Crona talking to someone in an alleyway and the name 'Medusa' comes up. Distraught, Maka then leaves, but bumps into a child. She apologizes and continues on her way. Back at home, Maka ponders about what to do. Late at night, Maka is still contemplating on what to do regarding Crona. Soul sees that she is troubled and asks her if she wants to talk to him about it. Maka tells him that she will tell him tomorrow, knowing that Soul will definitely help her. She decides to talk to Crona the next day before class. The next day, when Maka goes to check on Crona, she finds that Crona is not in their room. She then says Medusa's name in quiet anger. She then runs off to find them."
Who does Soul compare Maka to?,"Blair,Risaand Arisa",Witch's research arc,"Back at the DWMA, Maka sees the large amount of requests that female Meisters have sent to Soul for him to be their partner in his locker. She expresses her amazement at the sheer amount, and states that although Soul usually got love letters like these, they had increased dramatically in recent times. Soul grumpily replies that it's only because he has become a Death Scythe. Maka pauses, before thumping her partner's back and suggesting they go home. As they leave, amysterious girlwatches the two, and she deems Maka incompatible for Soul. Later, Maka complains that since she was the one who made Soul a Death Scythe, she should be getting some request letters too. Soul states that Maka's lack of sex appeal is the problem, and compares her to Blair,RisaandArisawho are passing by, promoting their cabaret club to other students. Maka briefly makes a snide comment about men, until she is startled along with Soul because Blair is hanging around two Witches."
Who is the mysterious girl still spying on them?,Maka,Salvage arc,"Maka and Soul worry about the two Witches being free, when Marie comes and takes Blair and the two Witches to the Death Room. Soul expresses concern on the situation, but Maka assures him that things must be under control if Marie is there. The two later hide and watch Marie and the two Witches go in, and watch the doors of the Death Room. They soon see Marie storm out in a temper, and then sees Black☆Star and Tsubaki approaching the closed doors. Black☆Star breaks the door down, even though there is a sign saying that no one must enter. Soul proposes they should just go in too, but Maka replies that sneaking around is much cooler, comparing herself to a heroine in a mystery novel. Soul soon gets bored and calls it all a waste of time. Maka spots the mysterious girl still spying on them, and wonders what she's up to, having noticed her already with her Soul Perception.
It is here revealed that Maka was actually the one who secretly took out the Level 4 book from the Library, which was the Book of Eibon manuscript that Death the Kid thought was originally stolen by Medusa. She apologizes to Shinigami for this, and tells him not to blame Spirit . She begs Shinigami to let her go on the mission to help save Kid. Shinigami, with some persuasion, complies. Maka, determined to rescue her friend, tells the rest of Spartoi that, 'This is for Kid!' Maka, along with Soul, Kirikou, Pot of Fire and Pot of Thunder, Black☆Star, Tsubaki, Liz, Patti and Blair, are sent into the Book of Eibon to save Kid. There, the group meetThe Table of Contentswhich informs them that they need to traverse through the seven chapters of the book in order to save Kid. The group soon enter the first Chapter, Lust, and Maka has her gender changed, based on everything she sees desirable in the opposite sex. Surprisingly, she resembles Soul a little which further implies that she has some feelings for him, and with her new male temperament, she immediately gets a nosebleed upon seeing the Succubus, much to Soul's annoyance. After passing through the Lust Chapter and into the second Chapter, Gluttony, Maka realizes that although they had left the Lust Chapter, she still appears male, although her personality has returned to normal. The Table of Contents explains that they will only gradually return to their original gender depending on the intensity of their sexual desire. The more intense it is, the slower one changes back. Maka snidely passes off the comment that Soul would probably change the slowest. She almost succumbs to the large amount of food on display in the Chapter, and barely manages to control herself. Maka ends up getting separated from the rest in the third Chapter, Envy. She finds herself caught up in an illusion based upon her envy. She ends up in a fake the DWMA, and is approached by the mysterious girl she had seen spying on her and Soul. The girl tells her that she is not worthy of being Soul's partner, and how little she understands Soul. Maka protests this, saying that she reads lots of music books in order to understand Soul more. However, when commanded to spin a nearby broom like she does with a scythe, Maka surprisingly fails to do so, which results in the girl mocking her, saying that she is only a bookworm that always needs to have Soul helping her. Maka remembers how Soul had always needed to help and lead her, and the girl reveals that she is envious of people who understand music like Soul, in contrast to Maka who, in a flashback, shows that she does not reciprocate Soul's appreciation for music. Convinced by the girl of her worthlessness, Maka breaks down in tears. Soul arrives at this point and asks her if something is wrong. Maka pretends that everything is fine. Soul tells her not to become separated this time and he takes her hand, moving on to the next Chapter. The two are next seen in the sixth Chapter of the Book of Eibon, Sloth. Soul drags Maka along, but soon, Maka gets teary, still upset by her previous experience, and stops Soul, saying that she needs to tell him something. She apologizes to Soul for dragging him back, before sitting down, and to Soul's shock, asks him to leave her behind and says that she cannot fight alongside him anymore. Maka destroys Giriko's first body When Soul asks her why she is suddenly saying this, Maka apologizes again and says that none of it is his fault and that she is to blame. She tells him to split up with her. Soul is unnerved by Maka's statement and tells Maka not to spout a lot of nonsense just because of an illusion in a book. Maka replies that Soul must have seen something in the chapter of Envy as well, and Soul, put off a little, denies that he saw anything. However, before their conversation can continue, Giriko attacks both of them. After kicking Soul aside, Giriko pins Maka down on the bed grabbing her wrists, saying that instead of waiting ten years, he is going to 'make her scream' right now. To his surprise, Maka replies, 'Do what you want,' which enrages Giriko, since she does not fear him, and he proceeds to kill her. Before he injures Maka, he is intercepted by Soul, and he transforms into his Weapon form as Maka prepares to fight. However, still emotionally distressed from the Envy chapter, she is unable to concentrate, and ends up leaving herself open for Giriko's attacks. When Giriko, tired of Maka's lack of determination, tells her that he will finish her off quickly, Soul suddenly transforms back into human form and Maka looks on shocked as Soul tells her that he will fight Giriko on his own. Predictably, Giriko proves to be stronger than Soul, and ends up wounding the Death Scythe several times. Maka looks on, dumbfounded as Soul, after a powerful blow by Giriko, falls to the floor at her feet. However, Soul still gets up, voicing his frustration on his inability to do anything for Maka. However, he states that this is not the sort of courage that Maka had shown to him. Determined to show his own courage this time, he stands up again to fight. Soul's words bring Maka back to her senses. With a resolute expression on her face, she mentally berates herself, calling herself an idiot for not believing in Soul just because she had seen an illusion in a book. She then proceeds to apologize to Soul, who forgives her and begins to attack Giriko again with new resolve, but is still distraught over the Envy Chapter and is starting to lose when Soul comes up with a plan to intercept Giriko's Soul Wavelength by using his piano and Arachne's ability to spread Wavelengths via webs. Maka then uses her Soul Perception on Giriko and Soul plays his piano and uses it to stop Giriko. Maka then proceeds to cut him in half and he then explodes. Believing Giriko is defeated she begins to walk away now feeling less distraught over the Envy Chapter. Then a now female Giriko comes up from behind and cuts Maka's back. He then explains that he had had another body for himself for backup in case something like this happened, and being in the Chapter of Sloth, Maka had not realized this as she had been too sloppy with her Soul Perception. He says that he is disappointed that he is a 'big-titted female' and says that people do not explode when they die. Maka then says that Arachne had exploded when she died. Giriko responds by praising Arachne, saying that she had been, 'something else,' and wonders if Maka would explode when she dies. Maka and Grikio continue to fight, but Maka starts to lose as she proceeds to acquire more injuries and Soul's piano is destroyed by Giriko's Wavelength. She begins to lose hope, convinced that she will die. However, before Giriko can kill Maka, his soul, not being able to take eight hundred years of rage, begins to rupture. Maka sees this using Soul Perception and then proceeds to slightly mock Giriko, telling him to sit down and rest, as there are many chairs and beds in the Sloth Chapter. Giriko, enraged, tries to kill her, but his soul explodes before he can do so, leaving Giriko's body as an empty shell. Maka laughs at his demise and is later seen carried by Soul on his back after the battle. Soon,the Black Massfrees everyone from the Book of Eibon, and they all tumble out the book onto the scene of battle. Maka is shocked and distraught as she sees Marie, Stein, Sid and Nygus at Noah's mercy. Although Sid and the others tell them to run, Black☆Star and Death the Kid decide to fight Noah and his monsters. Death the Kid asks Maka and Soul to help the two, and Maka is surprised as they activate the Insanity Wavelength in them. Soul asks if Maka can pull it off in her injured state with Maka replying that she has to. Holding Soul in Weapon form, she forms a Chain Resonance and supports Black☆Star and Death the Kids' sanities with her courage, whilst giving the two advice during the battle. Maka is in awe at Black☆Star's and Kid's new powers acquired through madness. Later when Noah is finally defeated, Gopher takes the book of Eibon and flees. Maka attempts to stop him, but collapses, due to her injuries and is caught by Soul."
What does Soul turn into a keyboard?,a pigtail,Mad blood arc,"Maka grows concerned for Soul as his scar that he had acquired from Crona begins to hurt. However, she gets a call from the DWMA, telling them that Crona had appeared in Moscow. She, Soul, Stein, Kim and Jacqueline arrive in Moscow. Whilst Kim and the others stay and tend to the soldiers affected by the Black Blood, Soul and Maka enter the area where Crona foughtFeodorandTsar Pushka. They find the two encased in two spheres of Black Blood. Maka laments over Crona's actions, and holding back tears and mentally calling Crona an idiot, tries to cut into the spheres with Majin Hunt. However, the moment Soul touches the spheres; he becomes insane due to the Black Blood and returns to Stein and the others, pulling her by the pigtail. Everyone looks on, shocked as Soul yells that his scar hurts, and his scar re-opens, causing a Witch Hunt-like blade to emerge out of it. Maka senses the insanity coming out from the scar in Soul's chest. Enraged, she demands Soul to tell her what he is playing at. Soul merely replies that he is only releasing the pain that he had been holding back for so long. Gleefully, Soul attacks Stein, who uses Jacqueline as a Weapon partner. However, Soul's blade is sharp enough to wound both Stein and Jacqueline, even in Weapon form. Stein decides to attack Soul before he can attack himself, but Soulretaliatesby using sound waves by turning his blade into a keyboard. The sound waves attempt to drag Stein into insanity, but Kim manages to negate the insanity with her Regeneration Magic. Maka, knowing that Soul will be ripped apart if Stein were to fall into the Madness, passes on her Anti-Demon Wavelength into Stein as well. Maka Chop! Stein marvels at how Soul is able to create such powerful sound waves by himself, and states that Maka's Soul Perception ability must have grown stronger as well through using Soul Resonance with Soul. Maka grins and states that although Stein only seems to have noticed now, she and Soul had always become stronger together. She adds, 'Right, Soul?' but Soul ignores her and keeps on attacking. Stein asks Maka what is going on with Soul, and Maka states that Soul has not completely given into the madness and is fighting within himself. She states that he will come back. Just as she says, Soul manages to quell the insanity within himself and returns to normal. Maka, however, annoyed that he is still acting cool even though he is not under the influence of the Black Blood anymore, gives him a Maka Chop with her hand. As Soul protests, Maka begins punching and kicking him, saying that it is payback for pulling her hair. Stein, relieved, raises the threat level of the Black Blood spheres and tells the Russian Branch to take cover. Another soldier then suddenly appears, and tells them that Crona had struck once again in Ukraine, much to Maka's shock."
What is the name of the village's hunter?,Heming,Hunt arc,"Maka and Soul along with Black☆Star and Tsubaki travel to Shisceda Village to helpHeming, the village's hunter take down a sky whale in order to help the village prosper for another year. Maka uses her resonance with Soul to grow wings and join Black☆Star in the sky where they search for the whale. As they begin the hunt, Maka feels that something is wrong with the sky. They hear a loud noise and the sky whale appears before them and they pursue it. Black☆Star suggests forcing it to go down, but Maka reminds him they cannot directly interfere in the hunt. When the sky whale spouts Maka and Black☆Star can sense there is madness in his spout, and Maka realizes that there is a higher concentration of madness at high altitudes and wonders why it is like this. As they continue to chase the sky whale Soul realizes that the sky whale is sensitive to sound and suggests using the noise in the sky to their advantage to corner the whale. Maka and Soul proceed to attack the sky whale with supersonic waves of sound, causing it to gradually descend to lower altitudes. Heming spots the whale and shoots it down, ending the assignment with success. As they head back to the DWMA, Maka reflects on the uneasy feeling she had back in the sky, saying it was similar to the Kishin. As they arrive back at the DWMA, they are met by Marie who tells them that Crona has been added to Shinigami's list and that Spartoi has been ordered to execute them.
Maka was upset about Shinigami's order of the execution of Crona. However, she understands what must be done. Kid said to her that it is not about executing Crona, rather than maintaining ""order"". While Maka was trying to find Crona, she came across Asura's wavelength. She and Soul went straight to Shinigami to report, but he already had found out his whereabouts. With that task at hand, Kid was in charge of investigating the matter , but had to quit Spartoi to do so because of his status as a shinigami. Maka asked him to take care since his mission was more dangerous than hers."

Soul told her that it's hard to pinpoint just one person out of the hundreds of souls in the area or even the world for that matter. She probably found the Kishin due to an reaction from the Black Blood. She knew that. Soul told her to call off for today and try again next time. She swears that she will find Crona. Later that day, she met up with her father after being summoned by a public announcer, to her chagrin and embarassment. He claimed that he was sorry and that he wanted to meet her no matter what. She asked if he was going to The Moon as well, which he was. It was an important mission for him plus it's his first foreign trip in a long time. He said that Liz and Patti are making an will, and that he was sorry about putting her in a tough situation with Crona's research and all. She said it was fine since they stopped for today. Spirit gives Maka her mother's wedding ring, rather than the will that she was expecting. Maka's mother sent it back to him after the divorce. It is revealed that he was young and broke, so he went to buy a cheap ring off the street from an old lady. According to the old lady, there is an charm written on the back side of it that could apparently purify madness and misfortune. It was brought to Maka for all the hard work she is doing for them and because she was born to them. Spirit claims that her mother is strong enough to not fall prey to madness and that she probably knew that the world is surrounded with madness right now. She probably wants Maka to have it. Maka thanks him and puts it on. He then mentions that, when her mother was pregnant with her, he wanted a boy. Upon her confusion, he says that he thought that a girl like her father would have inexhaustible source of worries. Initially, this statement annoyed Maka. However, her father went on to say that he was glad that it was her. He hugged her and said that she had grown strong. Spirit went on to say while he was a bad father; Crona was a poor child that was raised by Medusa. He and Stein should have stopped the witch back when they first met at the Santa-Marianovera's church. At this point Maka then remembers something that she had missed in her search for Crona. She hurries away, leaving Spirit relatively confused. Spirit then states that Maka reminds him of her mother's straight-forwardness. Maka and the other arrived in Italy. She continued to search Crona and eventually pinpointed their location. However, she want to make sure of a few things before proceed the mission. In her perspective, she is not sure she can fight Crona. When she went into Santa-Marianovera's church, Crona asked who she is. At first Maka thought Crona lost their memories again; however Crona said that they are just trying to straighten their memories and that she caught them in the moment. Maka said she came here to stop Crona from pursuing Asura and to persude them to come back to their friends. However, Crona refused because they just killed their mother, Medusa, and is afraid that they will do the same to her and the others. When Crona escaped to go to the Moon, she made a vow to bring Crona back, even if she has to break the ""order"" to do so. Then after Kilik's group leave, Maka, Soul, Black☆Star and Tsubaki decide helping Crona is more important than following the order of Spartoi. They abandon their duties as members of Spartoi and change back to their old clothes to show they were no longer a part of it, and head off to the moon.

While Kid and Black☆Star hold Asura back, Maka uses the Black Blood's power to enter Asura and talk to Crona, who had been consumed by Asura. She convinces Crona that they are doing the wrong thing, and Crona feels amazed that someone would go through such lengths and risks to help them after all they had done wrong. Crona, admiring Maka's selflessness and feeling they did finally have someone who cared about them, decides to use their power to seal up the Kishin on the moon. This in turn, however, puts Crona stuck inside the Moon's Black Blood alongside the Kishin.

Who is the second son of Death himself?,Death the Kid,List of appearances|gallery,"—Death the Kid to Noah,Salvage Death the Kid, commonly referred to as simplyKid, is the second[12]son ofDeathhimself and themeisterofLiz ThompsonandPatty Thompson.[3]Created from apiece of Death himself,[4]Death the Kid is known to be one of the top 3EAT studentsin theDWMA.[13] After his father's death at the connection of theLines of SanzuandAsura's defeat onthe Moon, he inherits his late father's position as leader and headmaster of Death Weapon Meister Academy as well as his name,Lord Death.[1]"
What does Death the Kid want to do in his own unique way? Available choices: [1]. He wants to become the next full-fledged Shinigami and inheriting his father's responsibilities. [2]. He wants to make his own weapons to his specifications. [3]. He wants to make his own weapons to his specifications. [4]. He wants to make his own weapons to his specifications. [5]. He wants to make his own weapons to his specifications.,[2].,Personality,"Described as possessing an ""uptight personality"" byFranken Stein,[14]Death the Kid is known to be a normally calm and mature individual compared to those likeBlack☆StarandSoul Eater.[15]Throughout the series, he's shown to be prideful of his status as aShinigami, wanting to become the next full-fledged Shinigami and inheriting his father's responsibilities[3]However, he also wants to do so in his own unique way, even telling his own father he wants to makes his own weapons to his specifications despite Death informing him that as a Shinigami, he doesn't really need to collect souls.[3]According toBlack☆Star's testament of his view on Death the Kid, despite being a Shinigami he is also capable of being humane and not displaying the typical arrogance of someone who has the status of a god.[16]This is true, so much so that he even see's himself partly as a human and expressed this fact toAsura.[17] Kid also has a great sense of morality and order, having expressed to theFlying Dutchmanthat despite being a god, he doesn't deny evil and that there's no one person without some evil within them. However, he believes that everything is about balance instead and strives to keep the balance between ""good"" and ""evil"" in equilibrium.[18]When expressing this, he also informed the Flying Dutchman that cares little for other's view on the subject and strives for a ""absolutely"" perfect world, granting no one freedom to kill.[18]Kid's view on balance is partly due to his father's teachings to him on order as a child.[19]Despite favoring order, he also aware of not following it blindly. He's quick to question his own father's actions when he hadthe DWMAstorm into Baghdad when searching forAsuraand explained that it's wrong to impose their will on others, though was understanding and sympathetic of his father when he realized that due to the threat of Asura, his father doesn't have the luxury of ""playing it safe"" and may be reckless in his decisions.[20]When the majority ofSpartoiwas ordered to executeCrona, Kid was the only one who supported the action, citing that Crona's actions were unforgivable and even alluded that the reason why they were ordered to do so by his father was for them to decide how to face Crona but said that both them and ""order"" must move forward to take care of the threat Crona possessed.[21] Kid is also extremely humble, shown when he pleaded to theWitch Order, theWitch Judge, and theWitch Queento assist the DWMA in stoppingThe Clownsand pushed for both Humans, Witches, the DWMA, and the Witch Order to have better relations.[22]He also put good faith and trust into the Witch Order, despite the protests ofAzusa Yumi.[23]He also explained to Azusa that merely holding ideals means nothing and one must realize that people must make an effort to make things better and that If being an adult means ""stapling out ideals"" because of experience, he doesn't mind being called ""Kid"".[23]Because of his views, Azusa comments that he is also pushy, much like his father.[23] Like his father, he also has a fierce and much darker side in his personality. While normally calm and collective, Kid is still susceptible to being angered, such as whenMosquitoinsulted his father[24]and whenNoah's Groupannounced their plan to assassinateMaka Albarn, he showed a considerable amount of anger.[25]When he later facedNoah on his plans of ""replacing the gods"", Kid even gave him a death threat, in which was guaranteed when he used theParent's Seven Raysattack on theSorcerer, killing him.[26] Despite his great capabilities, Kid also possesses some flaws, most notable him being a perfectionist to the point of having OCD/OD-esque qualities. Described as being ""too much of a perfectionist"",[27]he initially was very obsessed and concerned with orderliness and paying excessively close attention to detail so much so he complained about Liz and Patty's breast size being irregular, chose them as weapons due to their twin appearance in their weapon forms, and even refused to attack theWrath of the Pharaohdue to symmetry. As well as this, he dislikes the fact that hisLines of Sanzuwere incomplete and upon Liz pointing it out, he called himself an ugly pig and worthless piece of garbage until he was quickly cheered up by his fellow weapon partners.[3]He is even physically repulsed by asymmetrical arrangements to the point he almost vomited at the sight.[28]Due to his wanting to be precise in detail, it even took him over a month to help Liz pluck her eyebrows;[29]in addition, he fails an entire test due to being unable to correctly write his name symmetrically and accidentally ripping the paper while erasing, before being reduced to tears, causing him to cough up blood and faint.[29]He also letCronaandRagnarokget away to admire the sky and it's symmetry.[30]Despite being enrolled in counseling, it remained as a fatal and dangerous flaw.[15]Even the mere sight of something asymmetrical causes him to become more aggressive, not only killing theWrath of the Pharaohin a fit of rage, but also destroying thePyramid Anubisdue to his recklessness.[3]In actuality, this part of his personality is a manifestation of theMadness of Orderdue to being a part ofDeathhimself, a fact he himself is unaware of.[31] Despite this flaw, he is noticeable not unaffected by his father's appearance despite it being asymmetrical possibly due to his immense respect for him. This is a bit more evident when Kid was shown to even willingly sport the same robes of what his father wears on missions.[18][32]As time passes throughout the series , he becomes less affected of his perfectionist nature and matures enough to accept it, though will still occasionally bicker over small details.[33]This remains true even when he became a true Shinigami.[1]One of the earliest examples of this improvement is displayed when he claims not to care about the DWMA's broken spike as Black☆Star begins to descend into madness during their second duel.[34] Kid has his own, odd quirks. His favorite number is eight due to its symmetry[15]and, according to Liz, was willing to try and place himself in exactly eight seconds during a 100 meter dash test and end up not meeting the time.[35]He can also be somewhat overconfident in his ability, feeling the need to not studySoul Studiesjust because he was aShinigami.[18]Due to his perfectionist personality, he is the type of person to recall and correct people on the small of detail, pointing out even when infected by the Madness of Power toBlack☆Starhe never punched him and instead used his heel during their fight when Black☆Star erroneously stated he punched him into submission, something the assassin noted to be unique to Kid.[16]"

Madness Wavelength: As a grim reaper, Kid possesses a wavelength comprable to his father with unique characteristics within his wavelength that he inherited from his father.

The released wavelength itself generated a technique of immense power, capable of slaying a dragon.[69]When usingmadness, Kid's power reaches its peak, initially driving him insane and granting a brutal fighting style. After regaining sanity, he can still access this power in smaller increments, but prolonged use risks further madness. He adopts a darker attire in both states, with stitched lines on his mouth in the insane mindset.

What was the name of Death the Kid's next heir?,Asura,History,"Death the Kid was born from a fragment of Death's own soul to have a death god who was able to move freely. In an effort to ensure he doesn't turn out much likeAsura, he was purposely born with a childish nature so he may learn fear much like humans would and was given incompleteLines Of Sanzu.[citation needed] Kid and Death have a lesson on the nature of shinigamis. He was trained at a young age by his father to be his next heir. Kid himself worked hard to be the next generation death gods, unaware of the his father's fate once he becomes complete.[93]One lesson among others that he would learn was that while death gods are generally perceived to be beings that either uphold absolute order or govern the cross between the life and death of others; they are about maintaining balance.[94] As he got older, he grew a reputation for being a very talented and able fighter. Many students felt as if no one could compete with him. Eventually, he expanded his interest in being a meister for his own specification. He eventually heard of the Thompson Sisters and was said to bring them into custody."
Who is Shinigami's first partner?,Death Scythe Spirit,Remedial lessons arc,"Shinigami and Death the Kid are both seen watching the battle betweenBlack☆Star,Makaand their weapons againstSid. They soon discuss who it was that killed Sid and turned him into a zombie. With the culprit now revealed to beDr. Stein, Shinigami then explains that he not only was the current Death ScytheSpirit's first partner, but that he was the strongest student to ever graduate from the DWMA.[97][98] Kid is later seen watching the battle between Stein and the the DWMA students. He is shocked at the revelation and personally believes that they will all die at the hands of Stein. As the battle proceeds, Kid is astonished by Stein's masterful use of wavelength without the use of a weapon. Kid is soon unable to watch the onslaught brought on by Stein and wishes to aid them, but is stopped by his father, who states that this is for the DWMA students. Kid then decides that, henceforth, he, Liz, and Patti will be the DWMA students.On his way out of his father's room, Kid is seen stumbling as he believes he forgot to fold the edge of his toilet paper into a triangle. Patti and Liz try to help him but all their attempts are in vain.[99][100] There is constant talk regarding Kid enrolling at the DWMA. Black☆Star, being the person that he is, is angered that there is someone who is talked about more than he is. He then proceeds to go outside and wait for Kid to appear. Kid, however, is three hours late, as he spent the entire time making certain that everything was perfectly symmetrical before his departure. When Kid finally does arrive, he immediately begins to admire the supreme symmetry of the school building; however, he is quickly devastated when Black☆Star ruins the symmetry by standing on and breaking one of the spikes protruding out the main skull structure. This greatly angers Kid and he prepares to do battle with Black☆Star andSoul. During battle, Kid uses his twin pistols with great dexterity and handles both Soul and Black☆Star with extreme ease. The fight soon attracts the attention of the students inside the school; leading to Maka,Tsubakiand Stein having to go outside to observe it. During the battle, Black☆Star and Soul decide to attempt to actually work together as aWeaponandMeisterpairing.Despite their attempt, it fails horribly with Soul landing on Black☆Star's head in scythe form and Black☆Star being unable to lift Soul due to the horrible connection they have between their souls. Angered by their failed attempts, Soul and Black☆Star choose to break up as partners but to stay as friends. While they are hugging, Kid shoots them both in the head. As the two get back up, they decide to renew their attacks on Kid, but separately this time. Black☆Star manages to grab Kid’s leg and pulls him onto the ground, and Soul seizes the opportunity to slash at Kid. Kid narrowly avoids this and breaks free from Black☆Star's grasp, all the while pulling Black☆Star into an embarrassing blow to his head. Kid responds to this barrage by performing a soul resonance with Liz and Patti. He then gets intoExecution Modeand performsDeath Cannon. This creates a large explosion that knocks both boys out.Kid, surprisingly, loses consciousness too for seemingly unknown reasons. It is then revealed by Maka that, when Soul attempted to slash at Kid, he had cut some of Kid’s bangs, with Kid not noticing the broken symmetry until after the explosion. Soul and Black☆Star both agree that this was their""win from behind"", even though Kid technically won the fight. Shinigami later appears to pick up and attend to Kid, who is still unconscious from the broken symmetry.[101][102]"
How many points did Kid get for failing the test?,0,Experiment arc,"Stein issues a very important written exam for the class, with rumors being spread that whoever passes with the greatest score will make or become a Death Scythe. This being Kid's first test in the school, Patti tells Kid to do his best. Kid, however, replies that because he is a Shinigami, he already knows all he needs to about the subject of souls. At his house, instead of studying, and while checking up on Patti and Liz, Kid notices that Liz is plucking her eyebrows. He asks if he should be the one who plucks them, so her right and left eyebrows match perfectly. Liz rejects his offer, because it took Kid a month last time. Kid then begs Liz, until she accepts. Before Kid even works on them, he begins to draw a design. The day of the test arrives and several moments after the test begins, Kid is seen stuck writing his full name believing it is not beautifully written. Even after the hour had almost passed, he is still trying to write his name. This time, the ""K"" in ""Death the Kid"" is spaced wrong and has to rub out the letter lots of times, after numerous failed attempts. It is at this point that he starts to cry, stating that he is garbage and that the letter ""K"" has abandoned him. However; as he is viciously rubbing his mistake out, he mistakenly rips the test paper; horrified by this, he coughs out blood then propels off his chair, onto the floor and passes out . In the end, Kid failed the test with zero points for not completing it, although as a Shinigami, he most likely would have gotten a perfect score if did complete it."
Who is slowed down by Eruk while Kid is on his way to the Kishin's chamber?,Asura,A fight to the death at the anniversary celebration arc,"Kid is seen with a depressed look on his face when Maka and the others enter the room. When Maka asks what was wrong, Kid changes his expression and soon notices that Black☆Star completely neglected his outfit. Kid then welcomes everyone to the commemoration. After Shinigami's short speech, Kid begins his own speech, but is constantly interrupted by Black☆Star's obnoxiousness. It gets to the point where Kid kicks Black☆Star in the face and thus the two begin fighting, with Kid ending up in his depressed state for his ruined speech. Soon the party is ruined byMedusa, who escapes, and withFreetrapping everyone ina cube that separates them from the rest of the world. It was due toSidperforming hisCompulsive Burialthat Kid and his partners, along with Maka and Soul, Black☆Star and Tsubaki, and Stein through the ground and away from the imprisonment.

On their way to stop the revival of Asura, they are interrupted by a visit fromSpiritand, after some speaking, he joins the group. Eventually, Medusa appears, with the intent of being a hindrance. Stein tells the children to go on ahead, while he faces Medusa. After some trouble, Kid, along with Black☆Star and Maka, manage to pass byMedusa's attacks. While Kid is on his way to the Kishin's chamber, he is slowed down byEruka'sbombsalong with his obsessions having an effect on him. After being galvanized by Patti, Kid forces himself past the explosives. Once again, when he reaches closer to the Kishin's chamber, he begins to sense the insanity of the Kishin. Liz asks Kid about the Kishin. Kid then explains that the Kishin was defeated by Shinigami, who then proceeded to rip off Asura's skin and seal his soul within in, though he forgets to mention about Asura's blood. The conversation, however, is interrupted by a blast from Free. The two then begin to battle, though midway into it, Kid is distraught by the asymmetrical ruins surrounding him. Thankfully, Black☆Star makes an amicable appearance and brings Kid back to reality; the two then work together to defeat Free. While Black☆Star is attacking Free, he begins to take notice of Black☆Star's futile attacks. This eventually ends up with Kid concluding that the Free they see is amere illusion. After lecturing Black☆Star for not realizing this after being so close to Free, the two leave. Eventually, Kid makes it inside the Kishin's room. His first sight is theBlack BloodEruka is carrying.

He eventually returns to reality by recognizing that the hallucination is caused by the Kishin's insanity, He then goes to attack Eruka once again, but is again blocked by Free. Black☆Star then appears. Kid tells him to stop the Black Blood from being injected while he keeps Free in one place. Black☆Star's efforts proved to be fruitless, though, as the Black Blood was injected. Kid explains to Black☆Star that, while proceeding to slice the needle, his concentration was so high that he used the sixth sense of sensing wavelengths. This facilitated the illusion. Kid is now forced to witness the awaking of the first Kishin. He begins to shoot the sack of skin, though his efforts were futile. Kid also witnesses Black☆Star's fruitless attempts at defeating the Kishin. With the simple swipe of a hand, Black☆Star is blown away. Kid then tries his luck again, but he, too, is defeated by a simple tap on the head and knocked unconscious. Patti and Liz are seen carrying Kid after the Kishin escapes from Death City. The children are seen preparing to play basketball. Due to a shortage of one player, they force Maka into joining the game.

If Kid's team loses, they will put the paintings on Kid's walls in his mansion off by an inch; if Maka's team loses, she has to go shopping with her father. Ultimately, Kid's team wins, and Maka has to go shopping with her father, to Kid's obvious relief. ===Reunion Express arcKid is seen in class with the other students.

Kid and the others are at a large party. Kid notices Crona and comforts them about the hectic company. He tells Crona that they could open up and get used to everyone at their own pace. Later on, he retrieves Patti and Liz for a mission, commissioned by Shinigami himself. The mission is about an express train thought to have infinite energy, as it has not stopped for over 100 years. Kid then says that ademon toolis located within it. They then head to theSahara Desertand to the train station. They notice a passenger waiting, but pass it off as someone sightseeing. After a while, Kid becomes disappointed that the train doesn't appear and will most likely be late.

The battle soon reaches the room housing the demon tool as Kid eventually finishes him off. As Kid is about to open the box containing the tool, the injured Fisher King explains that the demon tool was created byEibon, and then states that both Eibon and Shinigami are the same. He tells Kid to open the box containing the demon tool. Kid is astonished as he opens the box that within the vase is both Shinigami's and Eibon's signature on it. When Kid inquires what all this means, Fisher King is struck and killed by aknifethrown by Sid before he receives any response. The African branch tells Kid that they can rest at the camp. Kid, however, is left perturbed. Kid is in the the DWMA library researching all he can on Eibon. When he fails, he asks the receptionist for a level 4 book relating to Eibon.

Stein explains how important it is and that he'll drop any team who fails to perform it. When they finally begin, the team began experiencing trouble. Soon, Maka begins to blame Black☆Star. Ultimately, Kid had to end the argument before it erupts. However, he is unable to stop them once they argue again, as Soul stops Kid, telling him to let them settle things themselves. When Maka cools off, the teams begin again, and are successful. Later on, Maka confronts Black☆Star and tells him to punch her as penitence for her outburst. Black☆Star happily agrees and does so, much to Kid's surprise.

However, none of their attacks are penetrating Mosquito's tough hide. Mosquito then uses his immense strength to overpower the children. Luckily, Soul comes up with the idea of team resonance and augmenting it with his music. Soul plays the piano, giving the children a rush of power, enabling them to maneuver flawlessly around each other without saying a word. They are easily able to overcome Mosquito with both their synchronized speed and strength. Kid manages to connect a Death Cannon, which destroys both of Mosquito's arms. However, before they can finish him off, Soul stops playing, advising them to leave as their time limit for staying on the island is almost up. They leave and watch how the Pyramid is destroyed by an explosion, though that, too, was a hologram from years past.

Mosquito turns into his form of 100 years past and the three begin battle. Kid and Free easily overwhelm Mosquito, who then reverts to hisform of 200 years past.

What is the name of the book Kid is face to face with?,Book of Eibon,Salvage arc,"When Gopher realizes Kid's weakness, he begins to take advantage of it by ripping off one of Kid's sleeves and finally drawing on only half of Kid's face. Kid is clearly distraught by this. Gopher continues his torturing of Kid, taking special care as to do so on only one side. Before he could continue, Noah appears, reprimands Gopher before sending him off to retrieve some tea and sucking Kid back into the Book of Eibon. Inside the book, Kid quickly wipes off the drawings on his face and rips off the untouched sleeve to regain his symmetry. It's not long before Kid discovers alarge mass of darkness. He is astonished that Noah had hid that in his book and grows anxious for someone to save him. Kid is face to face withGreat Old One of Power. Kid recognizes the wavelength and likens it to Asura. The being speaks to Kid, calling him a fragment of Shinigami, and reveals that he is a member of theThe Eight Warlordsas are Shinigami and Asura. He reveals that three of the warriors were eaten by Asura and those that now remain, himself, Asura, Shinigami, Eibon, and one other of whom Kid knows, which is rumored to be Excalibur. In light of the revelation, Kid inquires about the whereabouts of Asura in as much as he is a warrior. The mass is not pleased by Kid's hasty questioning and responds by asserting the fact that he is not Kid's ally, nor anything else. As he utters these words, he says that the existence of the 8 Warriors drive men to madness whilst drenching Kid with a black, liquid-like substance. Quickly, Kid is consumed by darkness. He musters a smile and remarks on this new feeling. He seen floating in darkness, commenting on the darkness and likens it to nothingness, and in as much as there is no left nor right, is a unity that exceeds symmetry insofar that it is the zenith of order. The nothingness, shared amongst all living things is death. In light of this, he concludes that he must eliminate everything to create the ""order"". He then speaks to the Mass telling him his goal to create the ultimate symmetry, the ultimate unity: nothingness. The black mass then tells him to try out his new-found power of madness, and Kid agrees. It is here he is confronted by his friends and appears ready to do battle with Black☆Star. Kid invites him and the two confront each other with Black☆Star saying that he will bring Kid back even if he's got to drag him back. Finally, he and Black☆Star face off in an underwater-like landscape. The two fight, and Kid admits to him that he is ""big"" and must be destroyed in order for Kid to make ""nothingness."" Just as Kid prepares a counter, the Black Mass gets in the way of Kid, to his disapproval. The Mass then turns to Black☆Star and asks him, ""What is the 'power' you seek?"" Black☆Star seems to have gained a new power from the black mass, and finally Kid and Black☆Star begin to fight. Several physical attacks are thrown, and then Kid activates one of the Lines of Sanzu. Then he blasts Black☆Star in the stomach and continues beating him. After Black☆Star gives him a few words, he punches Kid and sends him flying upwards. The both continue to kick and throw punches at each other and Black☆Star tries snapping Kid out of his insanity, saying that trying to make nothingness is the same as saying that balance is too hard for Kid to deal with, so he's trying to take the easy way out. He also argues that he does not have to be insane in order to be powerful. Elsewhere, Liz, Patti, Tsubaki, and the others await Black☆Star's return. During this time Liz remembers how she and Patti first met Kid, and how he saved them by thugs and how he had them be his new partners. She and Patti had been planning on using Kid's Shinigami status to gain the money and power they craved. However, the more time they spent with Kid, the more they grew to care for him, a fact Liz realizes after watching Patti laugh herself to tears. She thinks of how she and her sister hadn't cared about anyone but themselves before then, and if 'they had been killed by this shinigami'. It begins to rain money down on the group, and Liz thinks to herself that she doesn't care about money; all she wants is for Kid and Black☆Star to return safely. Patti and Tsubaki ask if she's ok, and she begins to cry, saying that she hadn't thanked him yet. Patti and Tsubaki simply smile and pull her into a hug. Back to the huge battle, where Black☆Star is talking to Kid once more, saying that while he may be using the power of insanity to become more powerful, losing himself to the insanity is nothing but a joke. ""I figured it out,"" he says. ""What I want to do once I get ultimate power in my hands."" The scene quickly ends after the Black Mass appears, saying that he will no longer listen to their definitions of power. Kid begins to think of the answer to power. He begins to go through what death gods are supposed to do, and realizes that Black☆Star is right, and thanks him. Black☆Star waves it off, saying that it was expected of him, since they were friends, and says that friendship is the only part of life not controlled by symmetry. Black☆Star then tells the black mass that, while his answer was ""power"" and ""strength"", but he was going to use his ultimate power to help Kid create the ultimate world. The Black Mass quickly said that what they were talking about was political terror. Since Black☆Star had lived through the seven deadly sins, he asks what it would be called if you add one more to the sins. That is the answer to their question, it says. Kid replies that those with power are those who create order, those with power are those who make the standards for justice. ""The 'justice' that is too old is evil. And with time it drives people mad... Shinigami and us gave birth to Asura."" The Black Mass replied. Black☆Star makes fun of the Black Mass. He instead says that they weren't alone, that there were Tsubaki, Liz, Patti, and many others especially Maka and Soul. Kid says that Maka and Soul can do things that they cannot do. The Black Mass reveals that he can help them all escape the book. The scene changes to outside Noah's base, where Stein, Marie, Sid,Tezca Tlipoca, and Nygus are about to enter the building. As Tezca opens the door, however, one of Noah's worm creatures attack and eats his left arm and half of his torso. Another attacks Stein, and Sid gives up his arm to save Marie from a third worm. Noah attacks them again, talking about how they weren't worth adding to his collection.Justinappears and attacks Marie, talking to his god. After knocking Marie and Nygus unconscious, he looks up to the sky and cries out, ""Hey God!"" Noah quickly traps Stein and summons a new creature he callsThe Manticore, which looks like a cross between a scorpion, a dog, and a human. When he summons it, however, it helps those trapped in the book escape. The children are, at first, oblivious to their surroundings, but are quickly horrified by the states of their teachers, who tell them to run. Kid demands to know who attacked them and he, along with Black☆Star, attacks the Manticore. The scene ends with Kid stating, ""In the world that I imagined you do not exist. I'll enforce your death penalty,"" with a murderous glare aimed at Noah. Using the power of Madness to gain an edge over Noah and his powers, Kid, Black☆Star, Kilik, along with Maka and Soul, battled Noah together. Soon overpowered by Noah'smost powerful beast,Kid realizes that his powers alone would not be enough to defeat Noah. Noah soon goes off about ruling everything when Kid proclaims that his way of ruling everything isn't beautiful but that the balance of things is beautiful. Thanking Liz and Patti for helping him and hoping to continue helping him in the future, Kid unleashes the power of the Sanzu Lines and utilizes the power of the Coffin Construction and the power of theParent's Seven Raysto defeat Noah's most powerful beast he kept in his book. Kid finally destroys Noah, though Gopher manages to escape with the Book of Eibon."

As Kid is about to connect his third line, a triple halo appears above Death. This halo closely resembles the lines on Kid's head. Once Kid connects all of his lines, Death falls to the ground only with a pile of his robe seen. After Kid awakens, his soul wavelength swells up to an enormous size that is about the size of Death's.
In his true Shinigami form, he is seen in a black cape, with eye pupils and a collar resembling Death's mask. Kid's Lines of Sanzu remain visible above his head. Afterwards, Kid feels an unnatural potential within him that he didn't feel before, and realizes it's a form of Madness that is the opposite of Asura's ""Madness of Terror"" called the ""Madness of Order"". While the Madness of Terror in Asura has is the power to make people lose their sense of humanity, the Madness of Order blocks senses altogether, and Kid smiles, realizing that his father didn't use that ability because he believed in humans, just as Kid himself did so with the Witches. He goes to finish the fight, with newfound faith, and newfound purpose. He aids Black Star in restraining Asura, which allows Maka to enter Asura's madness and save Crona from it. Crona then ultimately seals himself and Asura away in the black blood in the moon, defeating Asura. The new Lord Death dons hiscloak.

After being told by Spirit to take up the mantle of Death, Kid holds a ceremony a few weeks after the news of Death's passing announcing his desire to make the world a better place for humans.

Medusa replaced all of Crona's blood with the Black Blood and the mixture containing what was left of Ragnarok.[65] With Crona, Medusa raised her child to be a killer. One of the lessons they were taught was killing. Faced with a child who was conscious of other life and therefore couldn't ""deal"" with it, she would lock her own child in a dark room for days on end with Ragnarok under the presumption of them being ""punished"" for not following her instruction. She constantly pressured Crona into killing theLittle Bunny, and resorted to the same punishment when Crona remarked they couldn't ""deal with it"". Finally after a few days, Crona's sanity broke and they did as she instructed, killing the Little Bunny. Medusa then remarked that they would have bunny for dinner that night.[66]However, despite Medusa's intentions of making Crona an independent individual, they became the opposite; they became completely dependent on her own orders.

She then listens and watches from afar as Crona kills all the individuals within the church.[72] Later, as she watches Crona's battle withMaka Albarn, she questions theMeisteron their apparent slowness and when Crona asks how to deal with girls, Medusa tells them they should simply kill them.[73]When Crona prepares to finish Maka andSouloff, she urges them to do so.[74]Medusa is then surprised to find theDWMA's strongest MeisterandDeath Scythearriving.

She then escapes with Crona on hand.[76] She later reappears in her nurse guise, requesting Maka assist her in getting a love-struck Spirit off of her leg, causing the latter to be Maka Chopped.

Although she advises that even with Soul Protect, young Meisters can recognize a Witch by appearance, Eruka retorts her ""concern"" with the fact both of them employTransformation Magicand can use that to escape, a capability Medusa herself notably doesn't possess and plan to use theSoul Protectlimitations to their advantage and should she drop it, she'd be outed as a Witch. Cancelling their own Soul Protect, they prepare to kill Medusa. However, having anticipated their eventual altercation, she has one of herLight Serpentsshe implanted inside them earlier kill Mizune while explaining to Eruka they'reMagic Lifeformsand are automatic. Preparing to kill Eruka, she is interrupted by Stein and Maka's speedy reaction, with Eruka escaping. Faking the fact she ""sensed"" two Witches along with Stein and Maka, she supports the claim from Maka insinuating the ""Witch"" who ""hurt"" Soul was present, although Stein quickly rebuffs that notion much to her dismay, but expresses gratitude the school nurse wasn't hurt.[83] Tracking down Eruka with one of her Snakes sending a signal of her location to Medusa, she tasks the Witch with the releasing of the ""Man with the Demon Eye"", the man who plucked out Queen Maba's eye out despite the consequences with Medusa threatening her life all the while her feet grovels Eruka in her frog form. With Eruka relunctantly accepting and transforming back as she labels her intentions carefully, Medusa comically orders her to turn back into a frog, remarking her grovelling in her human form doesn't feel as good as her frog form.[84]"
Who does Medusa ask to eliminate a Meister and Weaponduo?,Demon Eye Man,Experiment arc,"Freeoffers to helpMedusa Congratulating Eruka, Medusa informs her that she will remove aSnakefor every task she's done, much to the frog's displeasure. Introducing herself to the Demon Eye Man, she seemingly agrees to call him ""Free"" instead — though she wonders if he could consider himself free with her intentions. She then asks him to eliminate aMeisterandWeaponduo, with the Werewolf accepting her request.[85]She later watches as Soul is unable to resonate with Maka through the use of her Snakes within Eruka andCrystal Ball, proclaiming ""Let the experiment begin!"".[86] Medusa watches as the battle between Maka, Soul, and Free commences. Medusa is curious as to how Soul's Black Blood will respond,[87]watching as both Maka and Soul are able to achieveSoul Resonancedespite their initial inability during their battle with Free. Medusa notes the Black Blood beginning to take effect as well as its capabilty for causing the Weapon affected to eat away at the Meister's very mind.[88]Impressed at the results and despite Free's eventual defeat on part of his rustiness, she proclaims that continuing her research will allow the Kishin to evolve.[89]"
What does Medusa give her to speed up the effects of the Black Blood?,a pill,Black dragon arc,"Medusa is confronted by Franken Stein. Giving her medical opinion of Maka's blood, Medusa claims that her blood was black because of it drying, although she saw Maka cough up Black Blood. Medusa gives her a pill which secretly speeds up the effects of the Black Blood. She then asks about Soul's wellbeing and speaks of the dreams involving anOgre, an occurrence unknown to Maka. When questioned, she claimed he insisted on talking about it. Maka then leaves angrily, with Medusa being amused by her irritation. She then looks for the files on Maka, only to be surprised by their absence. Stein intervenes, questioning Medusa's ""worry"" about Soul and Maka. The witch states that a lot had happened to them recently, while cursing at him internally. When Stein questions Medusa on Maka's prescription, she claims it is a personal herbal medicine that improves circulation and pulse, which it is in a way. This is while contemplating killing him and wondering how much he knows. Medusa says that she is crazy about herbs and couldn't just do nothing for Maka and Soul. When he insinuates she's a witch, she has a moment of killing intent but instead claims calling her such could be seen as harassment based on her appearance.[90] Medusa and Stein dance as she reveals her true nature and intention. Later, Medusa then instructs Eruka on gathering the case containing the Black Blood with her Snakes.[91]Rendezvousing with her group members later, she tells Eruka to open the case with the Black Blood as well as asking about the status of Free's Demon Eye, who comments he can control anIndependent Cube. Medusa is ecstatic, proclaiming she's been waiting for the day in particular to launch her move.[92] Informed by Eruka of their arrival later during the DWMA's Anniversary Eve via her Snakes, she instructs them to await at a location and wait for her signal, though is interrupted by a seemingly drunken Stein wanting to dance, much to her embarrassment.[93] Medusa tries to tempt Stein to fall onto her side. Stein later questions Medusa, revealing he had sent Sid to her laboratory in Libya, deducing her to be a Witch. Though Medusa buffs accusations with claims he's drunk, he reveals he wasn't to begin with and further deduces she is interested in the Kishin under the DWMA. Angered, she expresses intent to kill him if Death wasn't in the same room. She confirms his conclusions, claiming the Kishin's power is evolution itself and the DWMA hinders it and ""maintains the status quo"", with her intentions to undo the DWMA's effort. She then tries swaying Stein to come to her side, nearly kissing him. However, Sid interrupts and Medusa makes uses of the diversion, assisting Free with creating a Independent Cube with theMagic Calculationspell along with Eruka. Expressing the group having little idle time, Crona appears with the Mizune Family, trusting them to destroy Death City as her group then moves to resurrect the Kishin underground.[94]"
What does Rachel's mother use to smash Arachne's spider?,pornographic magazines,Reunion express arc,"Medusa, still possessing a snake takes possession of a dog. Later, a mother and a daughter walk by the alleys discussing their dislike for snakes and spiders. The daughter,Rachel Boyd, notices the dog poking around. Rachel dashes for the dog, her mother trying to catch up to tell her not to touch dirty dogs. As Rachel reaches her hand to the dog, she spies the emerging from the animal's mouth, which enters the girl's mouth. Rachel's mother arrives, too busy admonishing her daughter to notice the snake entering Rachel. Although drooling a bit, Rachel happily agrees to her mother's order to go home. At home, her mother takes notice of her strange behavior, but brushes it off nervously. The next morning, while waiting for her meal, one of Arachne'sspidersappears in the kitchen. Unable to find a newspaper with which to smash the arachnid, Rachel's mother uses one of her husband's pornographic magazines. But Rachel is undeterred: not looking behind her, she smashes the spider, barehanded, the innards of the creature splashed across her hand. At this moment, Medusa's voice emerges: she realizes her sister,Arachne, has discovered her. Rachel pulls her hoodie to cover her head, saying she is departing to go play. Before her mother can stop her, Rachel has already disappeared from the front lawn. Medusa controlling Rachel's body. Medusa then presents herself to Arachne atBaba Yaga Castle. Medusa criticizes Arachne for spying on her with a spider; Arachne criticizes Medusa for acting so fearless entering her castle and not willing to delegate this introduction to one of her underlings. Medusa says, as with her attack on theDWMA, she likes handling a task herself so to be authentic. Arachne tells Medusa such first-hand work puts her at risk of dying, her current childish form the proof of that fact. Medusa replies she uses this childish form to her advantage: who would suspect a child? Arachne also wants to know how, as she learned, Medusa could survive having her body cut yet “scatter your soul” to survive. Medusa explains she couldn’t allow [her] soul to be eaten bySteinandDeath Scythe.” It was by forcing Stein to deliver a finishing blow that she split her soul into “tiny pieces.” The release of the Kishin increased Medusa’s magic so she could have her soul regathered inside the body of a snake she had set loose earlier. Arachne accuses Medusa of having betrayed her in their fight 800 years ago againstLord Death, and she refuses to simply let Medusa leave so easily. Medusa attempts to play off the encounter as a sisterly reunion, one they really must do more often—until her exit is blocked byMosquito,Giriko, andMifune. The Arachnophobia agent looks nervous. But when Medusa refuses to fight back and continues her exit, Arachne allows her to proceed. Arachne anticipates Medusa will make a mistake soon and will be caught in her “web,” while Medusa plans to “slip through the cracks in [Arachne’s] network.” The nervous Arachnophobia agent offers to escort Medusa out of the castle, but as they walk, they discuss mentally through thesnakewithin that agent’s body: she isEruka, brought back into Medusa’s employ. Eruka explains “the others,”Freeand theMizunesisters, are already uncover as well as Arachnophobia agents. Eruka asks what is Medusa’s next plan, and the snake witch says she has to retrieve “something” she left behind inDeath City. Medusa finds Crona in Death City. In Death City, Medusa findsCronain an alley having just left a party hosted byDeath the Kid. Seated atop a dumpster, Medusa feigns surprise that her child recognizes her despite her childish body, but Crona wants to know why Medusa has returned to Death City. Medusa claims her desire is to reunite with Crona, worried for her child. But rather than bring Crona back with her, Medusa orders Crona to stay at the DWMA, to continue to serve as her spy within the academy. Crona stammers, confused that Medusa assumes Crona's time at the DWMA was to spy for her. Medusa claims Crona is being modest, refusing to think Crona would be at the DWMA for any reason other than to be spy on behalf of Medusa. Medusa informs Crona that a secret vault is inside the DWMA , assigning Crona to locate it. When Crona refuses in fear of betraying friends at the academy, Medusa asks, ""You'll do it for your mom, right?"" Even as memories of Maka flash by, Crona assumes a look akin to a previous mad appearance, agreeing to fulfill the requests of Medusa. As Medusa leaves, Ragnarok chuckles at the more interesting development, as a nervous and shocked Crona continues to smile madly. On the outskirts of Death City that night, Medusa turns back, chuckling upon discovering that a madness swirls through that city. She looks forward to what this madness will cause to transpire within Death City. When Crona returns to their room,Eruka, disguised in her frog form, arrives at the window. Through one of the snakes implanted in Eruka, Medusa speaks to Crona, communicating how happy she is with Crona’s performance and that she has a new mission for her child. Learning that Stein is now partnered with Marie, Medusa has an idea to “exploit [Marie's] kindness.” Medusa orders Eruka to hand Crona a pen, which contains within it “a bug” to plant into Stein’s lab. The bug itself, revealed to be a tinysnakecontaining within itself a listening device, which not only can listen to Marie’s conversations with others, but also can negate herhealing wavelengthand in fact augment the madness within Stein. Afterwards, Crona heads back to their room, takes a pillow from the bed and crawls into the corner of the room. Feeling the presence of madness around them, the pressure from Medusa, and the guilt for infecting Marie, Crona, despite wearing a crazed smile, cries."
What is the name of the Mizune Sisters?,Eruka,"""brew"" - the tempest arc","Medusa successfully acquires BREW. In her lair,Medusaawaits the arrival ofErukaand theMizuneSisters and their delivery of the real Brew. Eruka explains that, as the magnetic field blocked Arachne from spying on Lost Island through her spiders, the Mizune were able to enter the field, retrieve Brew, and leave behind a replica for which the DWMA and Arachnophobia to battle. Medusa also credits their success to her snake within Marie's body, which at the precise moment Stein would need to resonate with Marie to battle Mosquito for Brew, unleashes such powerful madness within Stein to incapacitate him. Eruka is shocked at how much preplanning Medusa had, and that victory emerged thanks to one tiny snake. Clutching Brew, Medusa promises to use the tool to unleash a tempest that will result in the goals she has planned for the DWMA, Arachnophobia, andthe Kishin."
What is the name of the Mizune Family in mice form and Crona?,Steininto,Internal investigation arc,"Upon receiving a daytime progress report that the location of thedemon toolsremains unknown,MedusainstructsCronato continue the search. Medusa also explains that she is returning withErukatoDeath City, as she senses amadnessswirling through the area, “the kind only others with madness can feel.” After Maka learns that Medusa has survived and that Crona is the spy, she runs away, but in the process, knocks into a little girl, that little girl being Medusa in possession of Rachel Boyd's body. Later on, that same day at night, Medusa witnessesJoe Buttataki's murder at the hands of anunknown assailant. Standing atop a roof, while her snakes circle around her, she smiles insanely. At some point afterwards,Eruka, in frog form, brags to Medusa, how well they have drivenSteininto madness. With them are two of theMizune Familyin mice form andCrona. Eruka then asks why Medusa is so quiet and appearing so sad. Medusa explains that she was thinking about the now deceased Joe Buttataki: before his death, was aware of her and the other witches' presence, despiteSoul Protect, which suggests meisters are evolving in their skill atSoul Perception. Eruka is less concerned, as Joe is dead, but Medusa warns that another living meister could develop this enhanced Soul Perception, which may require killing that person. Crona looks away, nervous. Medusa also realizes that, even with she, Eruka, and two of the Mizune sisters, that number does not match the number of other witches she could sense in Death City."
"What does Soul advise Medusa to do after acclimating herself to ""a pitch-black solitary confinement cell"" for the rest of her life, suitable for such a ""gutter hag""?",never tell the truth,Operation capture baba yaga castle arc,"Arriving in front of Medusa's cell, Maka realizes that she actually can sense the witch's soul. Within the cell, Medusa, feigning helplessness, asks for the people outside to bring her some water. Maka responds by kicking the door and demanding to know Crona's location. Feigning curiosity, Medusa asks who is speaking and pretends she herself does not know where Crona is. Frustrated that Medusa claims not to even remember who she is, Maka demands answers. Soul advises Maka that Medusa will never tell the truth and that it is pointless to anger herself. Soul then turns to the ""bitch"" of a witch to tell her that she should acclimate herself to ""a pitch-black solitary confinement cell"" for the rest of her life, suitable for such a ""gutter hag."" Putting an arm around Maka's shoulder, Soul guides her away, as Maka calls back to the ""bitch"" to expect to hear from the students again. When the students are away from her cell, Medusa chuckles: she knew fully well that it was Soul and Maka outside of her cell, and she knows DWMA will have no choice but to agree to her terms for her help. Later,Spiritarrives in front of Medusa's cell. After listening to a prison guard's warnings about opening her door, Spirit enters with a lantern and Medusa's dinner. As Medusa feigns petulance at how bright the lantern is in the dark cell, she has Spirit spoonfeed her. Spirit is amused, finding this practice similar to how he used to feed his baby daughter. Spirit then reminds Medusa that she herself has a child, Crona, and out of that concern as a parent had best release her grasp uponRachel Boyd's body. Medusa claims she holds onto Rachel's body while she recharges her magic, at which point she will give up the child's body. Spirit chastises Medusa for effectively holding a child hostage, but Medusa says that it is not Rachel that protects her from DWMA: it is the information she is willing to trade for her guaranteed safety. Although Spirit admits thatSid Barrettwas able to findBrewjust where Medusa promised, he thinks Medusa is still lying. Medusa requests that Spirit at least remove her restraints so she can loosen up, as he must recognize she cannot escape an academy full of meisters and weapons. As Spirit removes the bonds, he reminds her that she could have used her magic to remove them at any time—but Medusa takes pleasure from coercing Spirit to do so. As Medusa stretches in Rachel's body, Spirit's parental reflex kicks in: he cannot resist helping her pat the dust off her clothes. Death Shinigami Chops Medusa. Medusa announces her new demand: whereas the information about the witches within Death City and Brew's location were free gifts to DWMA, she wants to speak withLord Deathin person. While Lord Death does not trust Medusa, he determines her information about Arachnophobia will be useful. Medusa looks around nervously upon her entrance, claiming this is her first time encountering Death ""face-to-face."" She mocks Spirit for demonstrating any concern about her nervousness. As Medusa stands before Death, his body seems to rumble. Death announces Medusa's crimes for putting the world into chaos—then unleashes aShinigami Chop. Medusa—and Spirit—are stunned. As Spirit criticizes the reaper, Medusa remembers her hatred for ""this stupid school culture"" like the reaper's behavior. Death then picks up Medusa by the back of her hoodie and holds her five-year-old body in the air, demanding explanation about her deal. As Medusa realizes Death is toying with her, she struggles to cover her exposed underwear. She is then annoyed at Spirit's reverie about how adorable Medusa—and his own daughter—looked in baby pumpkins pants. But remembering she must adapt her performance around Death and Spirit's silly behavior, she asks to be set down and seat herself to begin their discussion—only to find Death and Spirit debating whether it is acceptable for adults to wear children's underwear without it seeming kinky. Annoyed at ""these assholes,"" Medusa shouts at the fools. Death apologizes for such discussions in front of a child—then picks Medusa up again by her hoodie, again exposing her underwear, and again making Spirit giddy over children's underwear. Fed up, Medusa threatens to kill Spirit with her vector arrows and attempts to depart. After Spirit and Death debate the merits of running gags, they promise to take the discussion more seriously if Medusa will stay in the room. Medusa proposes her terms: she will reveal the location of Arachnophobia's headquarters at Baba Yaga Castle, including how to capture the castle, if and only if she is given full command of this DWMA operation. Spirit is outraged, but Medusa knows he has no other option. Over tea with Death and Medusa,Spiritadvises providing Medusa not full command but only a remote post, away from DWMA key agents. Medusa refuses: she must be on ""the battlefield."" But Medusa then clarifies that this operation is not about a ""massive battle"" but a low-risk covert mission consisting of a few DWMA agents along with her associatesMizune,Free, andEruka. As Arachnophobia will expect DWMA to attack directly in the open, Medusa instead will lead a small force so to minimize the number of potential deaths for DWMA agents. A few agents is all that is necessary to take down an entire organization: Medusa cannot resist mentioning that the Academy fell to just four people . Death is hesitant, pointing out that his concern is not about minimizing his causalities but trusting those agents to Medusa's command. Medusa also wants to decide which DWMA agents to include, with only students as they are less likely to ""overthink"" her orders . This team will include someone with excellentsoul perception, someone who can make clear decisions and calm the team , and someone with brute strength . As she was a physician at the Academy, she will make the protection of their students her top priority. As Spirit criticizes including students on such a dangerous mission, especially with Medusa in charge, the witch counters that, with her magic, she is the only one present at the Death Weapon Meister Academy who can get Death's soldiers through Arachne's Sensor Net, a spiderweb around Baba Yaga Castle that, if tripped, alerts Arachne immediately to anyone's arrival. Because this Sensor Net is reconfigured every few days, Medusa's intelligence will soon be outdated unless they begin the operation soon. Medusa pointing out Arachne's Sensory Threads to Kilik. The operation soon commences with Medusa's team heading to South America, the location ofBaba Yaga Castle. The boat carrying the team reaches the shore, as all must proceed on foot, Medusa clearing a path withVector Arrowsto cut brush away. Despite Maka's hostility to Medusa, the witch says she requires herSoul Perceptionto locate Arachne. Kilik is less friendly than Maka, admitting his desire to kick the witch's ass. Medusa demands Kilik stop—not because of his shouts but because he is about to knock into Arachne's Sensor Threads, alerting Arachnophobia to their location. Medusa says she is committed to protecting this team, or else Arachne will win. Medusa then orders the students to walk forward in single file, as her magic detects the path to take away from any more Sensor Threads. The students walk by the river, with darker lines like spiderweb crossing the liquid's surface and nearby mushrooms and plants. Concerned this water is a trap, Kid orders Patty not to ""do anything stupid."" Meanwhile, Maka notices Fire and Thunder crying. Kilik explains that, asEarth Shamans, the siblings can hear Nature itself crying. Medusa agrees, sensing that Arachnophobia'sdemon tooldevelopment has polluted the river withmagic. While Medusa compares the cries of Nature to the cries of children to their parents, Soul is not impressed: ""You get off playing all high-and-mighty"" after turning the world into madness, all because she has no bit of compassion. Medusa remains silent. Medusa's team faces the Squid, a result of Arachne's magic pollution. A splash comes up from the water. Soul asks Maka to sense the presence, and she announces it is asoul, not that of a human, but of something big. The creature reveals itself,a large monsterrising from the water, its eyes mad, its tentacles lapping out of the water. Medusa realizes the magic pollution has mutated the local animals into monsters. Soul and other weapons transform, and Medusa orders her students to spread out. As the meisters take to the trees, the monster releases its tentacles, reaching to pin the students against those branches. With her chant, Medusa summons Vector Arrows, cutting through the tentacles and saving Maka and others. Ox gets to the ground, unleashingLightning King Quakeand sending the creature away. But Maka senses the creature still lurks under the water, waiting to strike again. Tentacles rise out of the water, almost slicing at Ox's face. An arrow appears below Ox's feet, as Medusa usesVector Plateto carry a surprised Ox away from danger. From the branches above, Kid fires upon the monster, but Maka sees no effect by those wavelength bullets or Ox's lightning. Medusa explains the monster's skin is strengthened by magic, requiring the students to peel away the skin. Medusa first will stab at the monster with an arrow, then she will use her magic to break down the skin's coating at that wound. After enchanting Kilik's weapons withVector Boostto double the power of his punches, he will punch at the wound to disable the monster. She orders the other students to back up her and Kilik. Medusa releases Vector Arrows at the monster's forehead, then performs the magic spells Analyze and Decompose to open the hole in the monster's skin. Following Medusa's order, Kilik leaps at the monster, drawing upon Vector Boost to strengthen hisTriple Fattack. The monster is downed, and Medusa brings Kilik back to the team with a Vector Plate. Both Kilik and Maka are shocked at the extent of Medusa's magic, but the witch orders the team to keep walking. The team arrives at a mineshaft dug earlier but now used by Medusa to gain entrance to Baba Yaga Castle. They are met by an Arachnophobia agent, revealed to be one of theMizuneSisters, who will guide them inside. Medusa orders the students to follow.MedusausesVector Arrowsto light the way through the mineshaft. BecauseArachnophobia's security increases after sunset, she advises camping out for the night within the mineshaft. She warns DWMA students to be careful. Kilikinterrupts, holding out to Kid the soul of the squid monster that they eliminated. Upon collecting the soul, bothSouland Medusa notice that a light emanates from Kid's back pocket. When Soul comments on this fact, Kid is surprised anyone could sense that light. Kid claims he must have left the flashlight he was holding in his back pocket and switched it on. Medusa realizes the truth: Kid is keeping Brew in his pocket, which activated upon the use of shinigami powers. Medusa considers when Kid intends to use that demon tool, whether as a threat to her. Medusa is interrupted byMizunewith news to boost students' morale:Kim DiehlandJacqueline O'Lantern Dupreare located here at Baba Yaga Castle. Kilik refuses to believe Kim, even as awitch, would join with Arachnophobia. Medusa responds that Arachne is very good at persuading victims by manipulating their weaknesses, drawing in such persons until, like a spider, she catches her prey in her web. Soul calls Arachnophobia a religious cult, but Medusa says it is that very reason why Arachne's organization has enlarged, because all members worship Arachne like a maternal figure. Once DWMA can kill Arachne and her top leaders, then the entire organization will fall apart on its own. As Medusa directs the students to march forward, she concludes with a reminder that their mission now includes the opportunity to see and free Kim and Jacqueline. This news leavesOx Fordquiet. Once the students reach a portion of the mineshaft, its girders twisted to hold up the tunnel, Medusa orders the students to set up camp for the night to sleep. While her teammates unpack, Maka approaches and confronts Medusa, demanding to knowCrona's location and why Medusa is willing to work with DWMA to take down Arachnophobia. Medusa responds by reminding Maka that, just like Maka's own father, she too is a parent concerned for her child: even if Crona is considered a terror, that child is her own, and she could not bear to be separated from Crona while that child resided away from her at the Academy. Stunned that Medusa would have any parental concern, Maka responds that Crona was much happier at the Academy and better off without such a malignant force like Medusa. She then reveals the truth to Maka that Crona was captured by Arachne and she intends to use them as a human sacrifice. Medusa sacrificed Brew and herself, a witch, to DWMA if it would save Crona. She concludes the discussion with an order for Maka to sleep before they continue their long trek through the mines into Baba Yaga Castle. DWMA students, disguised as Arachnophobia agents, are joyful to be reunited with Medusa. Because she can sense more Sensor Threads ahead, Medusa orders the students to be more careful as they follow her. Liz Thompson becomes exhausted, while Kid can sense ""an unbelievable number of souls"" ahead, which, as Medusa confirms, means they are already inside Baba Yaga Castle. Soul asks how they are to proceed, interrupted by someone waiting for them:Eruka, with a number of Arachnophobia outfits to disguise Medusa and DWMA students. After getting into disguise, Medusa separates from the group to get everything ready. When she's done, she finds the group and criticizes them, claiming she had been looking everywhere for them. Relieved, the entire group hugs her.
Having guided the DWMA students to an isolated hallway, Medusa unmasks so she may direct the students to separate missions. EightDemon Tool Locks, located in eight towers away from Baba Yaga Castle, generate magical gates preventing entrance into the Spider Queen Room, in the exact center of the castle and where Arachne sits upon her throne. While none of the DWMA students are magic users, and while there are eight Locks, Medusa argues that the students need only to destroy two of the eight locks, while Medusa and her team includingErukawill destroy the other six locks. Medusa approachesKilik RungandOx Ford, performingVector Conductto give them knowledge where to locate one of the eight towers: they now can see magic arrow-shaped markers she had planted around the Castle earlier and these arrows are visible only to her and those students, not to anyone else in Arachnophobia. Medusa assigns Kilik and Ox to one tower, and Kid andthe Thompsonsto a second. Medusa explains that, as soon as the eight locks are destroyed, she depends on Maka's soul perception to guide her through one more trap that lies between them and Arachne's room. Later on,Medusaannounces toMakaandSoulthatErukaand her other members are progressing, which requires that they hurry as well. Soul expresses concern to Maka that they are following this witch's orders. Maka is not sure whether Medusa is telling the truth about Arachne's kidnapping of Crona to use as a human sacrifice, but she cannot risk this chance to save her friend. Soul is not convinced, prompting Maka to ask whether he has a better suggestion other than to ""bitch and whine."" Medusa can no longer ignore this discussion, confronting the two to trust her for this attack to work. Maka tells Medusa to ignore Soul and continue with their mission. As they continued to walk Medusa had sensed BREW being activated. Medusa, Maka and Soul hit by Arachne's Mind Attack. Medusa, later on, announces toMakaandSoulthat the magical barrier has dissipated. As such, Maka assumes herSoul Perceptionshould be able to locateCrona'sSoul Wavelength, to find where they are being held as Arachne's prisoner, but as she performs Soul Perception, Maka and Medusa both sense a magical attack coming towards them. Spiderweb threads, looking like strings, shoot at the trio. Under the influence of this magic, all three begin to hallucinate that they have been transformed into marionettes.
After getting free of the hallucination, Maka asks Medusa what kind of magic just attacked them to produce such a powerful hallucination. Medusa explains that Arachne was attempting to coerce them to her side, attempting to take advantage of their weaknesses. Medusa then explains that, whereas direct attacks are effective against herself, they will not be against Arachne's magic. Instead, Arachne will attack from within, haunting their minds and souls. Therefore, Maka'sSoul PerceptionandAnti-Demon Wavelengthwill be necessary to win this battle. The doors of the Spider Queen Room open. Upon entering the room, now covered in spider webs, Medusa uses herVector Arrowsto push a path through the web, as Maka's Soul Perception guides them to Arachne's Soul Wavelength. Medusa strikes with more Vector Arrows to clear their path. Cutting through the last of the web, Medusa and Maka see Arachne seated on the pedestal of her throne, motionless. Maka is confused: while she can still sense Medusa's Soul Wavelength, she cannot sense Arachne's. Then Arachne's body falls to the floor, as if she is dead. While Maka looks down, the scene changes to the shadowy, spiderweb-covered ceiling, as if something hides there. In the ceiling's shadows,Soul, in weapon form, asks whetherArachne's lifeless body lying on the floor means that thewitchis indeed dead. Medusa asksMakawhether herSoul Perceptioncan find Arachne. Maka shudders as she hears something swirl in the room's shadows, as if the darkness is writhing. Medusa using Vector Storm to protect Maka from Arachne's attack. Maka and Medusa then look up to the ceiling at the madness coming towards them. Maka is surprised to sense thatArachne's presence is now within the madness itself filling up the throne room. Medusa explains that, as the body as nothing but a vessel, Arachne is truly within that madness only. Arachne's disembodied madness forms spider webs that scrape across the floor; Maka dodges, only for more to appear behind her—then, once Maka and Soul senseArachne's presence within the web, disappears. Tendrils of the madness envelope Maka from above, until Medusa rushes towards the meister and usesVector Stormto shield against Arachne. As the arrows wrap around the madness, Medusa performsCompress Vectors, decreasing the size of this overall essence of Arachne into a small ball that comes to rest upon the floor, but Medusa's Compress Vector fails: Arachne's madness explodes outward. Maka and Medusa are pushed back by the forceful exit yet stay on their feet. As Arachne explains to her sister that she has discarded her body to become madness herself, Medusa realizes Arachne's goal: she has become madness itself so she may attune her soul wavelength to that of theKishinand then absorbAsura. Arachne confirms: With the world consumed in madness, she will provide a haven, hence Arachne will be not only the mother of alldemon weaponsbut ""the mother of all things."" Medusa mocks her older sister, claiming Arachne's so-called creation of weapons owes not to her but to following the instructions already written in theBook of Eibon. Arachne reminds Medusa that what matters is not the plan or even the implementation. Rather, Arachne argues, it is how well someone can gain something from these actions, and Medusa should know: she could not attractFranken Stein, despite her desire for Stein. Medusa smirks, claiming that of course anyone would be attracted to Stein, as he had creativity, which Arachne sorely lacks. Medusa then remembers that it was Arachne who mocked the possession ofRachel Boydto assume this child's body, yet Arachne has given up her own body to look so ""much more ridiculous"" as just wisps of madness. Arachne's madness approaches, then encircles Medusa in blackness. Medusa hallucinates: she finds herself initially alone, stuck on a spider's web. The mad black cloud forms off of Medusa's cloak, forming into a more spider-like form of her sister. Arachne still thinks Medusa looks ridiculous as a child but has no intention to plunge Medusa into madness, announcing that she instead will tear apart Medusa's mind to devour it, then sounds of eating are heard. Outside of Medusa's hallucination, she collapses onto the floor. Soul recognizes Arachne as performing the same attack onto Medusa that she used against him earlier, but Arachne assures him that this magic is far stronger than anything she used against him. Medusa, still collapsed on the floor then observes the battle between both Maka and Arachne. She is impressed by Maka's Soul Perception and Anti-Demon Wavelength. After Maka and Soul are able to use Arachne's madness against her through her web, Medusa chuckles, realizing that by leaving the web connected longer than she needed to, Arachne left herself open to injury, dispelling all madness and leaving Arachne's body reconstituted for Maka to perform a physical, fatal attack. Still collapsed upon the floor, Medusa fears how dangerous Maka’sAnti-Demon Wavelengthis to witches. Spying Arachne’s hollow, soulless body, Medusa smirks and she proceeds to leave Rachel's body to possess her sister's. Medusa now in possession of Arachne's body. After Maka and Soul have successfully defeated Arachne, Maka senses a response: behind her, the corpse of Arachne rises, From Arachne’s body, Vector Arrows emerge, slicing into Maka’s side before either she or Soul can react. Arachne arises, Medusa now possesses the body of her dead sister. After possessing her sister's body, Medusa mocks Maka and reveals to her that everything she had told her about Crona before was a lie. She then concludes that, because of Maka’s far too powerful Soul Perception abilities, she is an impediment to the change this world demands, hence Maka must die. Before Medusa can strike again, she is stopped by meisterEnriqueandDeath WeaponTezca Tlipoca. As the pair continue laughing, Medusa grows tired of this usual foolishness of the DWMA and attacks them. After transforming, Tezca tells Medusa that the DWMA will soon claim Baba Yaga Castle, hence the witch is in a losing battle. Before Medusa continues to fight, she senses that Arachne’s body retains some consciousness, resisting Medusa’s full possession of the body. Due to this, she announces her departure. Before retreating, Maka calls out to her, demanding to know where Crona is. Medusa smirks and concludes that the Crona she knew is no longer the same person and she will not give them up to anyone like Maka. Having achieved her goals, with aVector Plate, Medusa departs swiftly."
Who does Medusa summon to battle students Kilik Rungand Kim Diehl?,Black Clown,Witch's research arc,"Medusa summons herBlack Clownthat she created to battle studentsKilik RungandKim Diehl. From afar in her lair, she observes the battle through her crystal ball. Although she admits the Black Clown has weaker madnessinfectionthan ""a trueClown,"" she is pleased to see this experiment underway so to identify how to improve her creation. Medusa also realizes thatArachne's goal to possess the same madness as theKishinis not impossible, so long as Medusa can then attune herself to that wavelength viaSoul Resonance—then possess the Kishin herself. But she anticipates thatNoahremains a threat. Therefore, Medusa calls behind her to informCronathat she is waiting for ""the other experiment now,"" at which point an unseen Crona confirms. During the fight, Kilik hurt his hand due to the hardened Black Blood and Medusa revealed that this was an experiment in hardening the Black Blood. The Black Clown didn't feel Kilik's attacks at all and Medusa commented that she was satisfied when the Clown was able put down attacks from Kilik, however, a powerful E3 blast, due to theTeamwise Soul Resonanceproduces an explosion that engulfs the Black Clown in a firebomb. Medusa looks through her crystal ball in shock, waiting for the flames to dissipate to confirm that indeed her creation has been completely destroyed. Medusa sees that the still living head of the Black Clown survives. Satisfied, she then orders the Clown to return to Crona before Spartoi discovers it, and the Clown follows through by performingEvaporationinto the ground. As bothBlack☆Starand Crona prepare to fight, Medusa waits for ""the real experiment"" to begin. She watches the battle through hercrystal ball, as Crona initiatesScream Resonanceand slashes at Black Star. But Medusa is surprised to see the ninja has barely moved. Black Star even dodges easily one of Crona's powerful attacks with a simple side-step. Black Star inhales deeply before letting out a loud yell, surprising Ragnarok. Almost instantly, Black Star is next to Crona, punching his opponent with multiple strikes. But Medusa is not impressed, recognizing thatBlack Bloodhas hardened Crona's bodies against such blows. Tsubaki urges Black Star to stop this assault before injuring his hands.Still watching the battle, Medusa is impressed that Black Star and Tsubaki's invocation of Crona's friends at the DWMA failed to get through her child'smadness. As the battle was drawing to its conclusion, Medusa became shocked that Black Star managed to crack through Crona's Black Blood with only his fists. Medusa reminds herself not to take Black Star's big talk so lightly next time and is happy enough that the experiment demonstrated Crona's madness has stabilized. But Medusa intends to escape with her child before Black Star kills Crona. Justin prepares to execute Medusa. Before she plans her escape she is ambushed byJustin Law, backed up byThe Clown, who had forced her to run away as he initiatesLaw-Abiding Silver Gun. As Black Star and Crona argue, Medusa evades Justin'sLaw-Abiding Silver Gun, as the defectedDeath ScytheperformsMadness Fusionwith the Clown. Because Medusa desecrated the Kishin with her fabricated clown, Justin intends to teach Medusa actual madness. Medusa mentally calls out toErukaandMizuneto retrieve Crona and escape. After performing the fusion, Justin stands over Medusa with Medusa holding him over her, her head kept within his guillotine as he prepares Executioner: Commence Execution. Justin announces her punishment for claiming power that belongs to theKishin: death. Medusa smirks, asking on what merits Justin can pass judgment after betrayingDeath. Music continues to play loudly in Justin's earbuds, as he announcesAsura's judgment. Medusa yells at Justin to stop, but it is too late: her blood coats the floor, and Medusa is beheaded. ThenVector Arrowsemerge, heading towards Justin, who slices them away. Medusa, head still intact, crouches and struggles to catch her breath, but at least she is still alive. Justin is surprised Medusa overcome hismadnessattack yet is interested to know whether she enjoyed the nightmare he gave her. Medusa tells Justin that, after what she experienced underArachne's madnessearlier, she prepared a counter-measure should she encounter a similar madness attack again. Justin realizes that Medusa's protection against madness is the new being that is floating beside Medusa, her newest creation: a portable version of theBlack Clown, which she refers to as herPurple Clown. While the Purple Clown is less powerful than the Black Clown, it is a shield against madness attacks. Justin is disgusted that Medusa would perform yet another ""blasphemy,"" when Clowns belong to Asura. Medusa replies, ""I'm a witch--blasphemy is our job."" Medusa activating Madness Fusion. Justin slices again at Medusa, who ducks and returns fire with Vector Arrows. But Justin does not move to avoid the arrow attacks: he says that, as madness has allowed for a new evolution in this world, Medusa's arrows are merely an outdated attack from ""an obsolete age."" Thus, Justin allows the arrows to approach—as his body repels them easily. Medusa, undeterred, responds with hersnakeattack—which she then combines with Purple Clown through Madness Fusion. Justin is surprised to see the Purple Clown dissolve, the snake's skin bubbling before a Vector Arrow explodes out of it. Three snakes form, more jagged than before and with arrows pointed off their heads, which slither against the ground, upending pavement before knocking into Justin. One snake grabs Justin with its jaws and slams itself, with Justin, into the ground, then the ceiling, and finally the wall. The wall's destruction pushes up a cloud of dust. Medusa smiles, waiting to see Justin dead. But blood drips from his cut mouth onto the ground, as Justin still stands—with that snake's head trapped within his guillotine, seemingly dead. ""That's one,"" Justin answers with a smile, as Medusa sends two more snakes at him. Justin leaps upward and, from the ceiling, slams his blades into the floor, pulling up segments of the floor upward to crush the last snakes. From the ceiling, Justin initiatesSilver Gun, beheading the snakes and preparing to do likewise to Medusa. As Justin lands on the floor, he is confronted by Medusa—and another iteration of Justin. Justin is, predictably, confused, but so is Medusa—because she sees Justin but, rather than a second iteration of him, a second iteration of herself. Medusa seeing a vision of Crona from Tezca's Reflect. Meanwhile, Medusa is trying to figure out why she sees two of herself, but Justin recognizes this subterfuge: the doppleganger isTezca Tlipoca. Images of Justin's past pass through his mind, as he stands before the Clown thenDeath. Justin tells Tezca not to ""reflect what's in my heart."" But Tezca replies, ""Life and death are bestowed equally on everyone...I'm a mirror that reflects people...The death you ultimately face is entirely up to you."" Medusa looks nervous at Tezca's claim of seeing that death which she will face, as an image of Crona comes to her mind. While Tezca unsuccessfully tries to talk to Justin, Medusa, fed up with this running gag, leaves these ""DWMA freaks"" behind to go home."
Who saves Nina's hunting party from Awakened Beings?,"Miria, Deneve, Helen, Cynthia and Tabitha",Seven year time-skip,"Clare hides in the mountains with theSeven Ghosts, where they learn to completely suppress their Yoki aura. During those seven years in the North, each warrior strengthened herself individually and polished her own specialty. Clare's is the Windcutter, since the Quicksword radiates Yoki, giving away one's presence. According to Deneve, Clare trained hardest out of the seven survivors. Miria, Deneve, Helen, Cynthia and Tabitha saveNina's hunting party—includingClarice—from Awakened Beings. Meanwhile, Clare and Yuma reach a deserted town, where they find a slave trade prison. They find clues ofRakibeing there and having escaped, giving Clare new hope that he is still alive. She requests that she travels south and fights Miria to settle it. In the end, all of the survivors travel south. On their way south, Miria, Deneve, Helen and Clare rescue anAwakened Being Hunting PartyfightingRifulof the West, recruiting Claymores for her plan.[33]Clare remains behind after the other three escape. Pretending to consider Riful's offer to join forces, Clare asks about the status of theAbyssal Ones, and after finding out what she needs, she escapes with the others.[34]When everyone is safe, Miria questions the hunting party leader,Audrey, and learns thatGalateaandRafaelaare no longer with theOrganization. The Ghosts proceed south. Upon reaching Rabona, they fight and defeatAgatha. Clare is the first one to reveal herself and uses the Windcutter to cripple and, with the help of her comrades, eventually destroy the former No. 2. During the battle, Clare re-encounters Galatea. Afterward, Clare learns fromSidthat Raki passed through the city with a young girl. Following Miria's revelations about the Organization, Clare, Yuma, andCynthialeave Rabona together to find Raki.[35] The three warriors proceed west, over theToulouseborder into Lautrec. Here they reach the eastern-most town,Lacroa, where they spot a search party from the Organization. When a female ""villager"" Awakens, Clare and Cynthia engage the Awakened Being, while Yuma knocks out the three Claymores as well as the two Men-in-Black.[36] The three defeat the Awakened Being but give themselves away, asRubelwitnessed everything. They all meet privately with Rubel, and Cynthia realizes Rubel is a spy for the Organization's enemies. Clare soon deduces that Rubel is baiting them to rescueRafaelaandRenee, hoping they get killed in the process. Despite the three's misgivings, Clare decides to rescue the two Claymores, anyway.[37]"
"What is the nickname of Teresa of the Faint Smile? (Bish no Teresa, lit. ""Smiling Teresa"")","She was nicknamed ""Teresa of the Faint Smile"" for the faint smiles that graced her face as she effortlessly slaughtered herenemies.",Contents,"She was nicknamed ""Teresa of the Faint Smile"" for the faint smiles that graced her face as she effortlessly slaughtered herenemies."
How did Teresa overcome Priscilla and the suppression squad?,"She adapt, and overwhelmed Priscilla and the suppression squad",Technical skill,"Fine Yoki Sensing:Noted first byIrene, Teresa's greatest strength is her outstanding technique to sense Yoki so acutely that she can detect the most minute changes in the Yoki flow of both Yoma and Warriors alike, accurately predicting and counter their every move. This skill allows Teresa to judge the strength, speed, and direction of an attack before her enemies can act. Irene concludes that Teresa's adeptness in this area was the main reason why she was the top warrior of her generation.[11] As a trainee, Teresa was also able to track downRafaela, who had completely erased her aura after the incident withLuciela, in the woods, surprising Rafaela as she thought she had completely erased her yoki aura.[1] Her sensory abilities are so advanced that she could predict exactly where to strikePriscilla, despite the latter being faster thanHysteria's awakened form, so fast that she was virtually invisible.[14] Sword technique:Teresa basically uses the standard sword technique and fighting style. As she showcased in all her fights, this version of an actually ordinary technique can counter extraordinary or specialized techniques from other warriors, as Teresa’s basic abilities such as strength, speed, agility and yoki sensing are extremely high and thus makes her otherwise ordinary fighting style extraordinary . After relying on her sword technique alone, she adapt, and overwhelmed Priscilla and the suppression squad.[9][3]Other powerful No. 1 warriors' standard sword skills are on significantly reduced levels. This shows the huge difference between their overall abilities; for example,Roxannementions that Cassandra's standard sword technique is only No. 5 level.[15]Warriors develop special techniques to enhanced their fighting capability against powerful Yoma and awakened beings, which in Teresa's case, is not necessary. Despite slightly injured by awakened Priscilla as she matched her speed, Teresa was able to adapt and continued to shatter her body, although Priscilla grew stronger with each regeneration.[14] As noted by Teresa, due to Claire inheriting Rafaela’s memories and thus her combat experience, Teresa has gained her habit of casually using her legs to perform powerful kicks, which brings her opponents at distance or throw them away from her.[9][16][4] Mimicry:Teresa has showcased the extraordinary talent and skill of being able to copy the other fighting techniques and specialized attacks of other Warriors. As first demonstrated when she was able to useCassandra's uniqueDust Eaterwith perfect precision, even though she met her the first time.[17][12]As well as other techniques, Clare has learned or witnessed before.[14][5] Teresa copying Dust Eater."
How many percent did the Awakened Rosemary defeat?,ten,Unrivaled yoki power,"Unleashing a mere ten-percent was enough to frighten and dispatch an AwakenedRosemary, who was a former No. 1 and would theoretically be on par with anAbyssal One.[4]It also enabled her to defeat a near-AwakenedPriscilla, the legendarily powerful No. 2 warrior of Teresa's era who became the strongest character in the series subsequent to Teresa's death.[18] Her high physical abilities could be enhanced considerably by her extraordinary and enormous S-level Yoki. So far, only Priscilla has been shown to rival her Yoki power in the series. Priscilla's Yoki potential is lower and her Yoki growth rate by release is significantly lower, only after awakening does her Yoki reach a similar level. Teresa's organization rating"
What happened to Priscilla before she fully Awakened?,passed her limit and begged Teresa to euthanize her,Battle with priscilla,"By breaking the Organization's cardinal rule, Teresa became a target for execution. At the execution site, instead of accepting her punishment, Teresa disabled all five of the Claymores tasked to slay her. She calmly said that she had found a reason to live—Clare.[26] Priscilla,Irene,Noel, andSophia were then summoned to execute Teresa. Teresa defeated them easily but considered killing Priscilla, noting the monstrous potential the younger Claymore possessed. However, Clare had softened her warrior's heart. Thus, she spared Priscilla and left the town with Clare in tow.[3] Priscilla, her idealist views shattered, went into a fit, and pursued Teresa, seeking revenge. Priscilla released over 70% of her Yoki and attacked in a blind rage. However, she still lost to the more experienced Teresa, who released a mere 10% of her Yoki. Priscilla then passed her limit and begged Teresa to euthanize her before she fully Awakened. Teresa sympathized with her and agreed to end her suffering. Priscilla, however, saw that Teresa had let her guard down and took this as a chance to attack, cutting off Teresa's hands before decapitating her. This cast some doubt as to whether Priscilla deliberately lured in Teresa to strike her down when she was least expecting it.[18]After this, Priscilla completely Awakened.[27] Clare later decided on using the Organization as a means of revenge. She carried Teresa's head back into town and wandered, searching for a man-in-black. Upon meeting/findingRubel, she demanded that Teresa's flesh and blood be put inside her own body, thus, beginning Clare's quest for vengeance."
What did Teresa offer to behead Priscilla when the young warrior surpassed her limits and began to Awaken?,mercy and pity,Priscilla,"When confronted with the warriors sent to punish her disobedience, Teresa expressed both wariness of and disdain for Priscilla. The No. 1 felt that the girl was naive for blindly complying with the Organization's demands but, at the same time, sensed Priscilla's innate strength. However, Teresa found herself, out of mercy and compassion, unable to kill her, though she was willing to heavily wound her during their second match. Also out of mercy and pity, Teresa offered to behead Priscilla when the young warrior surpassed her limits and began to Awaken. Unfortunately, it was this mercy that allowed Priscilla to strike and behead the No. 1. During Clare's time as a warrior and after the seven-year time-skip, Teresa has become an object of obsession for the AwakenedPriscilla. She sees Teresa as evil for killing humans, and during her battle withDauf, she regains her memory of the incident with Teresa and expresses delight that she would be able to kill her again. When Teresa is finally brought forth from within Clare by the Soul-Link technique, the strongest No.1 expresses disdain for the monster Priscilla has become and vows to defeat her once and for all. More than that, however, the remnants of Priscilla's human heart seeks out Teresa in an attempt to find someone or something that can finally overcome her power and regeneration to grant her death. In the end, Teresa disintegrates Priscilla by using the quicksword at 100% of its potential. When Priscilla asks why Teresa didn't end things earlier, when Priscilla was weakened, Teresa replies that it sucks to have your life end without knowing what's going on. At the last moment, Priscilla thanks Teresa and says she's sorry. True to her character, Teresa responds that there are no hard feelings between ""comrades who cross Claymores together.""[30]"
"What is the Hebrew word for ""rebellion""?",Miriam,Etymology,"""Miria"" is a transliteration of the Japanese ""Miria"" . ""Miria"" was possibly derived from ""Miriam,"" a feminine proper name, biblical sister of Moses and Aaron , from the Hebrewמרים, of unknown origin, said to literally mean ""rebellion,"" suggestive of Miria's attitude towardsthe Organization. ""Miriam"" or ""מרים"" was a name that was purposed to imply about a certain woman who has great resolve, who is marvellous, who is a creator, in short, an all talented and powerful woman that all fall short compared to her prowess. For unknown reasons the name was constructed by merging the words ""מר"" - Mister and ""מים"" - Water which all life originates from."
What is Miria's intelligence?,planning strategies and her tolerance for others,Personality,"With her talents in planning strategies and her tolerance for others, Miria is an outstanding leader. This is contrary to the Organization's aims and Miria takes personally the deaths of those under her command, as she cares for the lives of Claymores knowing that they are victims of the Organization. She will go to great lengths in order to protect them, including disobeying the Organization's rules and orders. She is not one to take sides in arguments within her own unit. DespiteHelen's constant complaints against Clare in their Awakened Being hunt together, Miria insists that ""every team member is crucial"" if the entire group is to succeed and survive.[5]She is also yet to be seen making belittling or condescending remarks towards other Claymores, even those with very low ranks. In turn, most lower-ranking Claymores regard Miria with the utmost admiration and respect. Adding to her strength as a leader is her intelligence. She is capable of both elaborate, careful planning and improvised solutions on a whim . Her intelligence has led her to victory when going up against opponents stronger than herself. For a Claymore possessing considerable power, Miria has a rather cautious demeanour. Instead of acting on a whim or making hasty conclusions, she often makes careful deductions before coming to a final decision. This is seen when she states to Clare and Helen that her views on the Organization are only theories until she can prove them to be true.[6]Miria had shown strong dedication into investigating the Organization's secrets and revealing them to others, and much information was collected during the seven-year timeskip. She revealed her secrets after the battle withAgathainRabona. She knows the information she gathered is reliable, and Miria is dead set as well with the other six of theSeven Ghostson her goal to send the Organization to its demise.[7] Though her early life and family are not known, Miria's closest connection was with her best friendHilda. After Miria unwittingly killed an Awakened Hilda, she began to regard the Organization with dislike and suspicion.[8]"
Who did Miria join a third Awakened Beinghunt?,Ophelia,Ophelia,"Miria joined a thirdAwakened Beinghunt, but to her disappointment, Ophelia led it instead of Hilda. Ophelia told Miria she met a Claymore who gave her ablack card, but she tore it up, much to Miria's surprise. Just then, their target appeared—a large Awakened Being who appeared to be wrapped in bandages. Ophelia alone was strong enough to take down the target, but she allowed Miria to cut off its head. As the Awakened Being died, Miria recognized it as Hilda. She grieved, asking Hilda why she did not identify herself. After an insensitive comment by Ophelia, Miria began to Awaken, but manages to force her way back, not wanting to give Ophelia any satisfaction. Due to Ophelia's bloodlust for killing awakened beings and getting the chance to taking down 2 in one day.[8] Ophelia reported Miria's near-Awakening toRubel, but the latter did not inform the Organization. Instead, he decided to punish her, eventually sending Miria on thePaburo Hunting Party. In between these events, Miria got promoted to No. 6, the same rank as Hilda."
Who is the leader of the Paburo Hunting Party?,Miria,Paburo hunting party,"At an unnamed town, Miria once again crosses paths withClare. The two are part of thePaburo Hunting Partywith Miria as the leader. This is also where Clare meets Helen andDeneve. Miria is surprised at Clare's rank of No. 47. However, despite Helen's protests, Miria takes Clare with them, believing the Organization had some justified purpose in sending her along. Later that night in thePaburo Mountains, Miria engages Clare in a sparring match to determine her power and trounces her, finding her weak, but then gets an odd feeling when facing her that, in spite of her performance, she is much stronger.[5] The next morning, a stranger meets the party, claiming to come fromLido. However, Miria senses something off and realizes that the man is their target, the Awakened Being. Miria senses how powerful he is and immediately suspects that the Organization intentionally gave them wrong information. The fight unfolds with Deneve, Helen andClaregoing down easily,[13]and despite Miria's Phantom Mirage technique, she is pushed to the edge of her stamina.[9]Miria is then pinned down and tortured, the Awakened Being's tongue dealing great damage to her stomach region. Clare manages to recover and cuts off five of the Awakened Being's limbs. Miria then rises back to her feet, her strength renewed enough to continue fighting, and joins Clare in finishing off the creature.[14] Afterwards, the party compares notes. Miria hypothesizes that the Organization is trying to kill them off because they are half-Awakened warriors who had caused trouble for the Organization in one way or another. Before separating, she advises everyone to conform and not raise suspicions while she herself gathers more evidence. She draws the symbols of the top five Claymores, warning everyone to stay away from them. The four then form a bond, taking a sword oath of honor.[6]"
Who is the commander of the Northern Campaign? Select from the following. (A) Miria. (B) Queenie. (C) Tabitha. (D) Yuma.,(A),The northern campaign,"Miria appears next as the commander of the Northern Campaign, having the highest rank among those present. The Claymores meet in the northern town ofPieta, the first town leading into the territory of Alphonse.[15] She organizes the 24 Claymores present into small teams, similar toAwakened Being Hunting Parties. She mixes the stronger and weaker alike on each team, so that all will be balanced and gain experience againstAwakened Beings. The warriors included in Miria's team are:Queenie,Tabitha, andYuma. Later, in a secret reunion, Miria meets up with the other three members of the Parubo Hunting Party, plusJean. When Clare asks for their chances in succeeding in their mission, Miria says that ""the chances of success are zero,"" primarily due to the fact that their mission also includes defeatingIsley, theAbyssal Oneof the North.[16] The task force defeats three Awakened Being scouts that appear without any casualties, though Yuma loses an arm. Afterwards,Undinetries underminding Miria's authority, feeling her team selection was reckless in placing weaker Claymores on equal footing with more experienced warriors rather than just putting them in support roles.Flora, however, supports Miria's decision, explaining that Miria's aim was for every single warrior to have actual combat experience against an Awakened Being, thus raising both the individual and all-around strength of the teams.[17] In a flashback, it is revealed that the entire task force was summoned by Miria, who announced a plan for survival. Before the second battle, everyone was to take half a Yoki suppressant pill. Should any Claymore lose consciousness, the enemy would think her dead, since her Yoki aura would be immediately suppressed by the medicine's effects. Miria apologized for this improvised plan, but everyone approved, especially Undine, who came out strongly in favor.[11] In the second battle, 27 Awakened Beings, led byRigardo, invade Pieta. The teams hold their own against the Awakaned Beings, three Awakened Beings falling versus five Claymores being killed—nothing short of miraculous given the power gap. Rigardo finds this unacceptable, and personally joins the fray. He morphs into his Awakened Form and proceeds to destroy Miria's strategy. He effortlessly decapitates the task force leadership, not bothering with the low-ranking Claymores, knowing the task force will collapse without the team captains. He killsVeronica, Undine, and Flora and fatally wounds Jean.[18] Miria vs Riccardo and he then wounds and prepares to kill Miria after a short confrontation. However, Clare goes berserk upon witnessing Jean's apparent death and Flora's grisly demise. Clare completely Awakens her legs and manages to sever Rigardo's right arm as he tries to kill Miria.[19]Clare eventually kills Rigardo by completely Awakening all four limbs,[20]but she is ultimately reverted at the cost of Jean's life. By the time Miria recovers enough to regroup, it is too late, and the Battle of Pieta is lost.[21]The Organization officially believes all are killed in action and that Pieta is now a town with no traces of life.[22]"
Who does Miria lead after seven Years hiding in the mountains of Alphonse?,"the Seven Ghosts: herself,Cynthia, Deneve, Helen,Tabitha, Yuma and Clare",Seven year time-skip,"Miria after seven Years hiding the in the mountains of Alphonse. Miria leads the survivors, dubbed theSeven Ghosts: herself,Cynthia, Deneve, Helen,Tabitha, Yuma and Clare. She has taught and trained them for seven years and has developed a ""New Mirage"" that can be used without releasing Yoki. She is swayed to return south by Clare, who discovers signs ofRaki's survival.[10] All seven survivors return south. While in theToulousearea, they sense an Awakened Being Hunting Party, led byAudrey, being harvested byRiful. Miria, Deneve, Helen and Clare successfully both rescue the party and flee from Riful.[23]Miria then questions Audrey some time later, discovering that neitherRafaelanorGalateaare still with the Organization. She also discovers thatAliciahas finally been ""completed.""[24] When they arrive inRabona, they findAgathathreatening the city. Miria rescues Galatea and destroys one of Agatha's legs. After Agatha's death, Miria advisesClariceandMiatato desert the Organization. Miria then openly states her intention to destroy the Organization, revealing the secret history behindYomaand Awakened Beings. Later, she makes arrangements withFather Vincentto keep Clarice, Miata and Galatea in Rabona. After a talk with the other six about clearing up any regrets, she arranges for Clare to search for Raki with Cynthia and Yuma. Helen and Deneve travel further south to visit Helen's home town inMucha. Meanwhile, Miria chooses to remain in Rabona with Tabitha. Miria later intercepts a shadowy figure who appears outside Rabona—Dietrich, who informs her of Isley's defeat at the hands of theAbyss Feedersand that Helen and Deneve are heading West to find Clare's group. Miria realizes that while Alicia,Bethand the Abyss Feeders are heading west to attack Riful, she has an opening to destroy the Organization. However, she decides to go alone - this decision was probably made at the very beginning of her plans to destroy the Organization. Without warning, Miria attacks Tabitha, immobilizing her, and ignores Galatea's warnings of death. Miria then dons her Claymore uniform and leaves forStaff. When Tabitha regains consciousness, Galatea explains Miria's reasons. Out of the seven, only Miria is willing to kill humans in her quest to topple the Organization. Miria incapacitating the current warriors Miria reaches the Organization and quickly dispatches the opposition. The majority of the Claymores gather to stop her, including the current No. 3, Audrey, and No. 5,Rachel. She appears unstoppable, until the Organization's men confront Miria with the newSoul Link twins, who can alternate between the Awakened and control state—an advancement over Alicia and Beth.[25] As Miria fights, she realizes she can never kill a fellow warrior. Claymore No. 10,Raftela, is brought out to confuse Miria's mind, bringing out Miria's deepest desires and making her hallucinate to see one of the twins as Hilda. As Miria falls deeper into the illusion, the Claymores attack en masse.[26]The warriors hack at her, scarring her face and taking off an arm, until one of the Organization's men orders them to stop, assuming she is already dead. What the Organization's men do not realize is that Miria is only severely wounded and not deceased. The warriors do not inform the Organization of this, their minds uncertain because of Miria's unwillingness to kill. Given a chance to recover, and with the aid of her fellow warriors impressed by her resolve, Miria, now sporting a cross-shaped scar across her face, returns to the Organization's headquarters and calls on the current generation of Claymores to revolt against the Organization. After rallying her fellow warriors, Miria leads them to an assault on the Organization's main compound itself.[27] Unfortunately, their progress is immediately barred by a group of Abyss Feeders that are sent to hold them back for as long as possible. Miria orders the weak warriors to stand back to protect themselves and let the stronger ones take up the fight. As the battle progresses, the Abyss Feeders begin targeting the lower-ranked warriors, but they are killed by one of the twin trainees just in time. Just as victory seems to have arrived, the rebellious Claymores are defeated by the three revived No. 1's, consisting of Cassandra the Dust Eater, Roxanne of Love and Hate, and Hysteria the Elegant. Miria engages in a fight withHysteria the Elegant, one of the strongest Claymores in the history of the Organization. Hysteria was infamous for killing many fellow warriors onRockwell Hillwhen they were sent there to purge her as she reached her limit. Hysteria's Elegance In the midst of battle, Miria is wounded several times by Hysteria, the latter using a technique that makes her appear as if she were passing through Miria's body. Miria knows at once that this is the technique that had earned Hysteria her nickname—the technique dubbed as ""the most beautful technique of all warriors."" She deduces that Hysteria'sEleganceis roughly similar to her own Phantom Mirage, except that Hysteria's precision is far superior, and the difference in their abilities makes Miria envious. She apologizes, stating that she would have to put Hysteria back to her grave. Miria's new Phantom Mirage Miria has trouble against Hysteria, finding herself unable to gain any advantage while being wounded several times. Miria thinks back to the time that she half-Awakened from Hilda's death, but was somehow able to revert back. She had conceptualized a technique that exceeded the Phantom Mirage by instantaneously releasing her Yoki from an already released state to a point far beyond the limit. This technique focused on raw speed and violence, but Miria was hesitant to try it because she feared losing her humanity. After years of training and now no longer afraid to cross her limits, Miria unleashes her new technique and is finally able to land a blow on Hysteria. The latter is shocked, and she asks Miria if she has gone mad. The half-Awakened warrior responded, saying: ""Shall we begin? Let's see which of us can last longer.""[3] Hysteria and Miria continue to fight, taking blow after blow. Hysteria claims that the technique is ""so disgusting that [she] might throw up."" Miria is not phased and counters gracefully, and then the two warriors begin to fight once more. However, when Cassandra Awakens, they both pause to watch.[28] Miria is surprised and horrified by Cassandra's Awakening, fearing the birth of a new Abyssal One. When the Abyssal One makes its attack on the petrified twins, she attacks it and orders them to take Audrey, Rachel, and Nina and run. However, Hysteria chooses then to resume her attack, angry at being ignored, and Miria's attention is divided. She tries to evade the Abyssal One, but in doing so leaves herself open to Hysteria's speed and loses her left arm in the exchange. Miria falls back to her new Phantom Mirage, but Hysteria can now barely evade the attack by recognizing the timing of its beginning. Miria sustains more wounds, lamenting that she could not win using a skill so inferior to the Elegance without ""dirty tricks."" Then, she uses the new Phantom Mirage one last time—a disguise for her true strike. Sacrificing her right arm, sword in hand, she spears Hysteria through the chest just before the former No. 1 makes her evasion. Miria purposely falls on the abandoned sword of another warrior, and, as Hysteria closes in, grabs the hilt in her teeth, twists and pushes her body around, and slams the sword through Hysteria's throat. Her final remark to Hysteria is, ""To tell you the truth, even though you have died before, I didn't want to kill a fellow warrior."" Hysteria Awakening with the sword still in her throat Climbing to her feet, Miria makes her way over to her right arm and begins to reattach it, hoping to convince the surviving, un-Awakened No. 1 to help defeat the Abyssal One. She later watches, however, as Roxanne's body is thrown near her while Cassandra's upper human body reaches towards the fallen warrior. Miria is then shocked as she notices the other remaining No. 1's starting to Awaken due to their severe wounds.[4] Miria wonders in shock on how Hysteria can be alive, but then questions if the resurrected warriors were even alive to begin with and, in horror, watches them Awaken. Having saved an unconsious warrior who was still alive, Miria tries to escape from Hysteria but Hysteria's speed outmatches hers. Hysteria, now Awakened, asks Miria to pull the sword from her throat out so she can feast on one of the warriors she impaled. As a token of gratitude, she would allow Miria and one of the warriors she had been carrying to leave. In anger, Miria releases more yoki and tries to attack Hysteria, missing as Hyteria jumps into the air. Miria relases more Yoki, and this starts to damage her armour as her muscels started to expand. Miria says to herself that she will save her comrades this time, even if it means losing her humanity, but is pulled back to the ground byAnastasia. She is told to calm down by Deneve who says, ""We came all this way just to punch you. At least remain human until were all done punching you, Miria.""[29] Tabitha cuts Hysteria's wings Six warriors engage Hysteria while Miria is aided by Cynthia and Yuma. At first, the fight seems to be in the Claymores' favor, with Tabitha managing to sneak up on Hysteria to cut off her wings as the former No. 1 was unable to detect her. The tide turns abruptly, however, when Hysteria demonstrates how should could fight in the sky without wings.[30] After a series of attacks following a single jump, only Helen and Tabitha remain uninjured among the group of six and Hysteria manages to capture Anastasia. Miria considers Awakening, noting that how things are going, they were just going to be obliterated. Deneve stops her, however, and convinces her that they were going to defeat Hysteria, a monster, while remaining human. AfterNikefrees Anastasia from Hysteria's clutches, Miria reengages Hysteria, noting that she could fight the Abyssal One evenly with coordination from everyone. This is merely a ploy, though, as Miria's true aim is to lure Hysteria into the battle between Roxanne and Cassandra.[31] Miria luring Hysteria into Roxanne and Cassandra's battle With Helen dislodging Hysteria's blades, Miria manages to catch the Abyssal One and land a blow, but is surprised to see only scraps of flesh. Hysteria had shed some of her Awakened body in order to be become lighter, and she was also trying to grow new wings. Miria tries to intercept Hysteria before the latter can grow the wings but fails. Nevertheless, despite suffering injuries, Miria successfully lures Hysteria into Roxanne and Cassandra's battlefield, using the Abyssal One's pride to her advantage. Apparently cornered, she exclaims to Hysteria that her friends are her wings and promptly zooms out of the battlefield using the last strand of Anastasia's hair, leaving Hysteria in the middle of the two battling Abyssal Ones.[32] Miria approaching Hysteria's broken form Hysteria chases after Miria in vain, the younger warrior's speed proving to be greater than her own due to the yoki all the other Claymores lent her through Anastasia's hair. In her pursuit, she gets struck by one ofRoxanne's blades from behind and then suffers further injury fromCassandra. She begs Miria to spare her as the latter approaches her broken form. Miria raises her sword, saying she should be brave and die a death worthy of a No. 1. Hysteria briefly recalls the events leading to her first death, and as she recalls the memory ofTeresa,Priscilla's Yoki reacts and forms an apparition. Helen and Deneve come to Miria's aid at once and attack the apparition, causing it to be dispelled. Miria mentions that she just felt a shockwave. Miria and the rest of the warriors prepare to engage Cassandra. However, the Abyssal One leaves Staff, apparently full from devouring Roxanne as hypothesized by Helen.[33]"
What does Miria propose that the Seven Ghosts free Clare before the Abyssal One reaches Rabona?,"the Dust Eater is, in Miria's opinion, the strongest of the resurrected No. 1s",To the last battle,"In the temporary peace following the fall of the Organization, Miria sees to Raftela when she is brought from the Organization's headquarters. She thanks Raftela for her help against Cassandra and Roxanne and says that she understands the other warrior's position as the No. 10. Afterwards, Miria listens to Deneve's regaling of the events that occurred in the West, coming to the knowledge that Clare merged with the Destroyer to seal away Priscilla. However, from learning this and observing the lingering image of Priscilla produced from Hysteria's corpse, Miria deduces that the resurrected No. 1s' all had some sort of connection to Clare's mortal enemy. In addition, she reveals to the others that said enemy is now driving Cassandra, the surviving Awakened No.1, towards Rabona in order to release herself from Clare and the Destroyer. But when Helen pushes for the warriors to slay Cassandra before she reaches the Holy City, Miria calmly objects, stating that doing such a thing - difficult in itself since the Dust Eater is, in Miria's opinion, the strongest of the resurrected No. 1s - would leave Clare trapped forever. Thus, she proposes that the Seven Ghosts free Clare before the Abyssal One reaches Rabona. Miria's greatest fear is that Cassandra will merge herself with Priscilla, making the latter stronger than before, but figures that freeing Clare will diminish the chances of that happening. Then, if the warriors have a great amount of luck on their side, Cassandra will regain control of herself and become defeatable. Deneve calls Miria out on this imperfect logic, but Miria replies that ""miracles don't feel all that distant"" to her now. She reminisces on Clare's desire to search for Raki seven years previous and how she thought that the younger warrior was just ""wasting her time."" Regardless, by some chance, that same boy is with them now thanks to Clare's belief that she would succeed. Miria then claims that ""miracles aren't meant to be wished for; they're meant to be created by our own power."" Next, Miria discusses with Helen and Deneve the means by which the Seven Ghosts would need to pass Cassandra in safety and in secret. When Raki suggests that they return to Rabona by boat, she agrees with the plan as it is far preferable to traveling by land. However, she claims that Raki should go with them because she believes his voice will reach Clare better than anyone else's. Then, after Raki says his goodbyes to the warrior trainees and after Yuma, Cynthia, and Tabitha appear, Miria leads the way towards the journey to Rabona.[35] Some time later, Miria arrives with Raki and the other Ghosts in Rabona. After consulting Tabitha on Cassandra's current distance to the Holy City, she believes that they will have enough time to implement their defense strategies. Of course, she becomes as cautious as the others when they all realize that several high-ranking Awakened Beings have gathered around the city and that it has been emptied of its inhabitants. Turning to the nearest Awakened Being,Octavia, she asks if any of them had something to do with the missing inhabitants and is shocked to find that the people left of their own accord. Miria is then confronted byChronos, the former No. 4 of the male generation, about the Organization's destruction, but she has nothing to say. Afterwards, it seems that Miria is the only one who was able to identify most, if not all, of the Awakened Beings' identities and relative levels of strength. On the other hand, she has no idea how many of them will escape unscathed once the fighting begins. Inside Rabona, Miria is greeted by Miata and a hysterical Clarice. Shortly thereafter, she is given a friendly greeting by Galatea, who forgives the actions that led to the Awakened Being attack on the city some days previous. Later, she listens to Galatea's explanation on the absence of the citizens and why the soldiers of Rabona have decided to stay. The former No. 3 then leads the Ghosts plus Raki to Clare's location, where everyone is shocked to see Priscilla's form emerging from the mass of the Destroyer. It is revealed that this emergence is what prompted Galatea to see to the citizens' evacuation, and Miria agrees with the decision. That night, Miria speaks with the soldiers, Miata, and Clarice and tells them that, soon, the city will become a battlefield. She recommends that the soldiers leave the city and follow the normal citizens, but they politely refuse and she apologizes for wasting their time. Then, she gives the same recommendation to Clarice, who also voices her wish to remain in Rabona to protect it. Smiling, Miria tells her that she leaves the defense of Rabona to Clarice, Miata, and the soldiers, but gently warns them not to bite off more than they can chew.[36] After preparing for battle, Miria accompanies Raki, Galatea, and the other Ghosts back to the location of Priscilla and the Destroyer. She watches on in silence as Raki communes with the mass of flesh and Yoki in an attempt to bring back Clare.[37]Once Clare is released from the mass, Miria readies herself for the release of Priscilla, and then gathers with Raki, Galatea, and the Ghosts to see Priscilla wreak havoc amongst the gathered Awakened Beings. Clare joins them, clad in her old armor, and begins telling them all she knows about her greatest enemy and how she will give her life, if necessary, to destroy her. Miria gives Clare back her claymore while inquiring if the younger warrior, to say something like that, really thinks all of her friends are so worthless compared to avenging Teresa. Clare's path towards revenge has been forever affected by meeting with and befriending her comrades, and Miria states that Clare will not accomplish her goal alone, but together with those who hold her dear. When the Seven Ghosts give a warriors' salute with Clare to illustrate that point, Miria gladly joins them.[38] When some of the weaker Awakened Beings are driven into Rabona by Priscilla, Miria joins the other warriors in order to subdue the creatures. Partnering with Clare, she helps in destroying an Awakened Being whose battle tactics are highly similar to those of BloodyAgatha. In the midst of the skirmish, Miria notices the change in Clare's fighting style, but does not comment on it.[39] When Chronos andLarsenter Rabona to speak with Raki, Miria confronts them with the other warriors at her back. Suspicious about their visit, especially after seeing the two escape Priscilla's attack with no injuries, she threatens them with an all-out fight if it turns out that they came to try and feed. Chronos, however, warns her that the other Awakened Beings who escaped harm are becoming hungry and that the warriors should proceed with extreme caution. But before he and Lars can leave, Miria asks them if they are going to flee from Priscilla and her incredible power. She herself says that the gathered warriors are planning to fight Priscilla of their own free will, and then asks if Chronos and the other Awakened Beings would not like to fight her themselves if there was a possibility of victory. Once Chronos acquiesces to hear out Miria's unspoken invitation to fight alongside the warriors, she outlines the plan of attack. First, they will attempt bring back Cassandra's senses in order to prevent her merge with Priscilla. If that goes well, they will next send the Abyssal One, along with their own combined strength, against the One-Horned Awakened Being. Chronos expresses his doubts, but Miria emphasizes that the plan can only work if everyone present contributes to it. The two Awakened Beings leave without a concrete answer, but Miria is unfazed. Instead, she confers with the other warriors and then announces the beginning of the implementation of their plan.[40] When Cassandra is almost on top of Rabona, Miria leads the other warriors into the impending battle. She warns Clare about the Abyssal One's great agility and is amazed to see the younger warrior fend off each incoming attack with the Quicksword. Unfortunately, Cassandra begins to regenerate, and Miria knows it is time for Clare, Deneve, Helen, and herself to distract the creature in order to buy Yuma, Cynthia, and Tabitha time to draw out the former No. 1's consciousness. This proves to be very difficult, however, and Miria finds herself frustrated at the lack of progress. Thus, she is surprised when Octavia and the other Awakened Beings appear in order to lend their assistance in defeating the Abyssal One.[41]Watching on, she becomes further shocked at the sheer amount of power these new allies command against Cassandra, for they appear to deal severe damage while receiving little in return.[42] Nevertheless, Miria remains uneasy, for it does not seem that Cassandra's sense of self is returning, and she is stunned when the Abyssal One stands and reveals herself to be changing into a duplicate of Priscilla. Miria then senses an incoming attack, for she knows of the Dust Eater technique from Audrey, and this warning allows Clare, Helen, and Deneve to evade.[43]When Clare begins to move forward in rage, Miria stops her, saying that Cassandra has not completely turned into Priscilla and that some of the Awakened Beings remain. One of these Awakened Beings isEuropa, who wants the warriors to set before her the guts of all the inhabitants of the Holy City. Miria declines, but coerces her to fight by suggesting that Cassandra is the nearest threat to the Awakened Being's food supply. She then watches as Chronos and Lars Awaken and join the fight, and in the midst of the chaos, she eventually charges forward with Clare, providing an opening for Clare to get close to the Priscilla look-alike and destroy it.[44] In the ensuing silence, Miria questions whether or not Cassandra's sense of self has returned. When one of the Awakened Beings attacks, Miria calls for him to stop, but he is subsequently dismembered and killed. The former No. 6 then realizes that the Abyssal One's true strength without Priscilla's control is much greater than she originally thought, and she surmises that this power was why so many warriors were present for Cassandra's execution at the Organization.[45]When Europa flees in the face of said power, Miria fears that she is heading towards Rabona in order to feed on its inhabitants instead. During Europa's attack on the Holy City, Miria remains with the Seven Ghosts to fight Cassandra. She does, however, sense Miata's Awakening and is shocked that Galatea would allow it.[45] The Seven Ghosts and the Awakened Beings continue to fight Cassandra, but Miria soon realizes that they are at an impasse. When the fight suddenly stops, Miria senses that the battle between Priscilla and the Riful-Being has ended and that Priscilla is victorious. She also says that while the One-Horned Monster's strength has fallen, the reduction is smaller than the Ghosts predicted. In addition, she says if the Ghosts' team and Cassandra continue to keep cutting away at each other, there would soon be no one left to oppose Priscilla, no matter who wins.[46] Miria, Clare, Helen, and Deneve soon rejoin Tabitha, Yuma, and Cynthia, with Miria informing the latter three that their original plan is still in effect. Miria praises Tabitha, Yuma, and Cynthia for their work in bringing forth Cassandra's consciousness and announces that they will now pit the Abyssal One against Priscilla. While Octavia and Chronos continue to attack Cassandra, Miria instructs the Ghosts to focus on Yoki Synchronization to further guide the former No. 1 to Priscilla's location.[47] The warriors eventually confront Priscilla, and Miria uses her Phantom Technique to try and catch the Awakened Being offguard; she is unsuccessful. She continues to try to fool Priscilla with after-images, but the former No. 2 merely comments that Miria has ""interesting movements"". When Clare begins to attack with her Quicksword, Miria jumps out of the technique's range and is quick to realize when the younger warrior begins to also utilize Rafaela's fighting style. She then uses her Awakened Phantom in conjunction with the Quicksword, but Priscilla easily evades, and Miria becomes further frustrated when the technique repeatedly fails. Moments later, Priscilla comments that Miria, out of all the warriors, should know best that the Ghosts have no more tricks left to try. Cassandra, Octavia, and Chronos then appear, and the former No. 6 replies that all the warriors will fight to the last to try and survive.[48] When Priscilla reaches a form intermediate between that of a human and an Awakened Being, Miria guesses that her Yoki-sensing ability has been dampened and the damage she sustained as a human is impeding her Awakening. The former No. 6 then instructs everyone to not let up their attacks, for they cannot allow Priscilla any chance to further transform. Miria's Phantom Technique finally hits Priscilla, removing her right arm, a portion of her side, and her right knee, but the One-Horned Monster suddenly Awakens behind her. However, Clare destroys her sword-arm again with the Quicksword before Miria can be cut down.[49] As the battle continues, Miria signals to Tabitha, whose Yoki is still fully suppressed, to make a sneak attack on Priscilla from behind. The former No. 6 then muses that Priscilla is not only the most powerful Awakened Being: she is the strongest warrior as well. Once again, she tries to distract Priscilla with the Phantom Mirage and then the Awakened Phantom, but is parried. When the One-Horned Monster blocks Tabitha's sudden strike and rips her apart, Miria is horrified and rushes to the fallen warrior. Together with Yuma, she gathers Tabitha's scattered body parts, and then she watches on as Cynthia and Yuma use Yoki-Synchronization to try and heal their comrade.[50] Miria is stunned when Clare manages to finally cut Priscilla apart with the Quicksword, but she turns back to Tabitha and urges her to concentrate on healing her wounds. When Tabitha requests Cynthia focus only on reattaching her right arm, Miria objects, saying that the gravely injured warrior will die if the rest of her body is not fully healed. Tabitha argues that her injuries were already mortal, and Miria is further silenced by the revelation that Priscilla's Yoki is still present. Tabitha asks Miria to hold her hand as she dies, and when the former No. 6 makes to do so, she is lightly punched in the chin - this was what Tabitha promised to Deneve if they managed to rescue their captain from the Organization. Miria listens on as the former No. 31 praises her ability and kind composition as a leader, and she continues to hold her comrade's hand until she finally slips away.[51] Miria begins to fight again after Priscilla returns and assimilates Cassandra and Octavia. She carries Tabitha's claymore with her, and says that the two will go in together to finish the battle. When Clare Awakens Teresa of the Faint Smile from inside her, Miria senses Teresa's Yoki and remarks that it is similar to Clare's, except strange.[52]Once she sees Teresa's face, she realizes that she has never seen the former No. 1 before and wonders if it is really Clare upon checking Clare's symbol. After Cassandra, Octavia, and Chronos are killed, Miria remembers that Clare carries within her the flesh and blood of another warrior: the strongest No. 1, Teresa of the Faint Smile.[53] As Priscilla lies weakened, Miria surmises that the creature no longer has even half of her original power. She then stands and listens when Raki, at Teresa's behest, regales upon his time spent with Priscilla and Isley and upon the secret he learned from Isley's training. Soon afterwards, when a fully recovered and more powerful Priscilla approaches, Miria learns from Teresa that Clare always viewed her as a close friend, comrade, and even a sister, and that Clare would not have come as far as she has without Miria's friendship and assistance. Teresa and Priscilla then engage each other, and Miria is amazed at the fluidity of Teresa's evading speed - that it is simply normal movement for her and not a specialized technique like the Phantom Mirage.[54]"
How does Helen view herself?,human,Personality,"Helen smiles. Helen has a unique demeanour compared to the other Claymores. She can be bold, overbearing and brash. She is similar toNoelin these aspects. However, she is also one of the most optimistic and cheerful of the Claymores and tries to enjoy life as much as she possibly can, which explains her unusually large appetite. She makes many attempts to lighten up the ""doom and gloom"" attitude of her fellow warriors, despite the many grim situations they get themselves into, such as the Northern Campaign. She shows much more raw emotion than the typical cold, distant Claymore. Despite her tendency to pick on lower-ranked warriors, she is capable of showing great loyalty to her friends as well as those who have earned her respect and will defend them faithfully. Though she is headstrong and often acts before she thinks, she is also able to give good advice when she told Deneve that Claymores were ""only human."" Despite being half-Yoma, Helen still views herself as human, a trait she shares withJean; she also hates the idea of becoming anAwakened Being, something she considers a monster. Helen can also be somewhat of a bully who likes to poke fun at people's touchy sides. She is quick to judge, especially towards Claymores in terms of numerical rank; one has to work hard to change her first impression. As soon as she learned ofClare's low rank, Helen was disdainful at the prospect of working with someone she deemed as weak and did not hesitate to ridicule Clare at every chance she got. Once Clare proved herself in the fight against an Awakened Being, Helen changed her attitude and respected Clare a lot more, eventually becoming friends with her."
How many years did it take Helen to suppress her yoki? A: 7 years. B: 7 years. C: 7 years. D: 7 years.,A,Abilities,"Helen's skills improved so greatly after the 7 year time skip that, while still suppressing her yoki, she could keep up and wound Isley multiple times, before he unleashed his massive yoki."
What is the organization rating of Helen?,renegade,Extendable drill sword,"Helen's Drill Sword During the time she and her fellow renegades were training inAlphonse, Helen learned to emulateJean's special attack: the ""Drill Sword"" . Unlike Jean though, who required time to fully coil her arm and was limited to only close range attacks, Helen can utilize the Drill Sword almost instantaneously as well as hit foes at virtually any range. Also, while Jean needed to release approximately 50% of her yoki, Helen doesn't need to and as opposed to Jean, who's maximum amount of ""Rotations"" was set at 21, Helen can rotate her arms up to 55 times giving her variation much greater piercing capability. Helen organization rating"
Who saves Priscilla from being infected with a Yoma spike?,Dauf,Priscilla's attack,"During the subsequent fight between Clare and newly-arrivedPriscilla, Deneve and Helen are pinned down by the second Yoma spike barrage and can only watch from afar. When it is revealed that Clare cannot Awaken, Deneve theorizes that it must beJean's influence that put a ""wedge"" into her subconscious that prevents her Awakening. She and Helen then distract Priscilla, snatch Clare from under her nose and then attempt to run for their lives. Deneve remarks that Priscilla is way above their heads in terms of power and suggests that they pray to the goddess of fortune to make an escape. The luck does not appear to be on their side, however, since Priscilla closes in on them fast. Tossing the unconscious Clare to Helen, Deneve attempts to take Priscilla down by having nearby Yoma spike creatures fire upon her, but the desperate tactic does not work. She then resolves to hold Priscilla off for as long as she can and orders Helen to escape over the latter's objections. She is unexpectedly saved byDauf, however, who survived Priscilla's earlier assault on him and Riful by being infected with a Yoma spike. Using Dauf's distraction, Deneve sets course for Rafaela-Luciela merged being, judging that even they would be less dangerous than Priscilla. Still, she comments than no matter how long Dauf holds Priscilla off, they won't escape her in time. True to her words, Priscilla proves to be too fast, causing Deneve to actually have to abandon her own claymore by throwing it at Priscilla to buy some time.The Destroyer attacks the oncoming group, striking Priscilla and allowing them to temporarily get away. When the Destroyer reveals its true form, it attacks everyone present and Deneve loses her right arm in the chaos. She warns Helen that when she took the hit from the true body of Rafaela-Luciela, her Yoki was drained and she is now barely able to heal . Deneve expresses extreme shock at Clare's apparent death and, along with Helen, watches the Destroyer absorb Clare's remains, but not before listening to the warrior's final words. Just after Clare is absorbed, Priscilla appears and destroys a large chunk of the Destroyer, later asking the two where Clare is. Helen strikes at her with a ranged attack, but Priscilla grounds her arm with spike ribbons. Deneve takes this opportunity to try to attack from behind, but is pierced through several times by Priscilla. When asked again about Clare's whereabouts, Deneve tells her that Clare is dead. In a state of shock, Priscilla stabbs Deneve over and over with spikes while Helen yells in the background for her to stop, unable to move because of her pinned down arm. When the Destroyer comes and impales Priscilla many times in all directions, this gives Helen time to free herself and get Deneve to a safe location. Upon being put on the ground, Deneve starts coughing up blood and begins to Awaken, scaring Helen. Fortunately, Yuma, Cynthia and Dietrich appear and Yuma uses Yoki Synchronizaton to help heal Deneve's arm. Once healed, Deneve informs the group of the situation so far. She also theorizes that Clare willingly let herself be absorbed by the Destroyer, not only to save them, but to exact revenge on Priscilla as well."
Who does Deneve call Miria a traitor and a naive idealist who wasn't fit to be a captain?,Tabitha,Rabona's crisis,"Deneve then appears in the Holy City of Rabona just in time to fight off the Awakened Beings attacking the city. She rescues Tabitha, who was about to get stabbed by an Awakened Being, stopping its attack with just one arm and telling the other warrior not to act so carelessly. The fight continues for some time and, eventually, all of the Awakened Beings are destroyed. However, Galatea then appears and tells the group that Miria left to fight the Organization alone and that she most likely failed and died. Due to this failure, the attack on Rabona was a retaliatory strike from the Organization in effort to eliminate the remaining rogue warriors. She and Tabitha then inquire as to Clare's whereabouts, assuming she is dead, but Deneve looks morose and says nothing as Helen explains this is not the case. Later on, the remaining Ghosts, plus Dietrich, Galatea, Clarice, and Miata, help Rabona recover. Then, the Ghosts prepare to go fight the Organization. Tabitha attempts to leave before them and fight in the same way Miria did, but is stopped by Deneve, who engages her in battle. She states that if Tabitha wishes for death so badly, she might as well give it to her then and there. All in all, Deneve calls Miria a traitor and a naive idealist who wasn't fit to be a captain, which prompts Tabitha to punch her in the face out of distress. After telling her to let Miria feel that punch, she askes Dietrich to go with them to the Organization so that she can discover the truth about it for herself. Deneve even says that if what Dietrich finds brings her to defend the Organization's actions, she should not hesitate to do so, and that if they cross blades, they will do so with the intent to kill each other."

What is the name of Kaede?,Lucy,Anime,"Kaedeist die Protagonistin der Geschichte. Wie alleDiclonii, leidet Kaede seit ihrer frühen Kindheit an einer gespaltenen Persönlichkeit. So besteht sie anfangs aus zwei Persönlichkeiten: Kaede/Lucy und ihr Dicloniusinstinkt, welcher sie zu manipulieren versucht. Lucyist der Name, den Kaede im geheimenForschungszentrumbekommt und Kaedes Persönlichkeit nachdem sie es aufgab, sich ihrem Instinkt zu widersetzen. Lucy ist keine von Kaede abgespaltene Persönlichkeit, sie ist Kaede, die sich nun bewusst von ihrem Dicloniusinstinkt leiten lässt. Sie ist auch das kleine Mädchen, das Kaede war, welches die Menschen hasste. Dies ändert sich auch nach all den Jahren nicht. Ihr Dicloniusinstinkt kann, anders als Nyuu, Kaedes Körper nicht übernehmen, weswegen sie nur zu ihr spricht. Sie ist jedoch sehr überzeugend, da Kaede die Schmerzen nicht länger ertragen will. Sie schafft es am Ende des Mangas jedoch aus Selbsterhaltungstrieb zweimal Kaedes Körper zu übernehmen. Als Lucy wurde sie die meiste Zeit ihres Lebens in dem Forschungszentrum festgehalten, mit der Absicht, sie nach der Vernichtung der Menschheit für die Bevölkerung der Erde mit reinblütigen Diclonii zu benutzen. Nyuuist neben dem Dicloniusinstinkt eine weitere gespaltene Persönlichkeit von Kaede/Lucy, die jedoch alle anderen Persönlichkeiten vollständig unterdrückt. Nyuu ist bei ihrem ersten Auftritt etwa auf dem Stand eines Kleinkindes, da sie sich mit nichts auskennt und alles neu lernen muss. Ursache der plötzlichen gespaltenen Persönlichkeit ist die Kopfverletzung, die sie durch den Scharfschützen bei ihrer Flucht aus dem Labor erhielt. Sie verlor vorübergehend ihr Gedächtnis und entwickelte eine kindliche Persönlichkeit, die nur in der Lage war, ""Nyuu"" zusagen. Obwohl ihr Dicloniusinstinkt mit Kaede/Lucy interagieren kann, ist die gespaltene Persönlichkeit Nyuu autonom und hat zunächst keine Kenntnis von Kaede/Lucy oder dem Dicloniusinstinkt, wie auch umgekehrt Lucy von Nyuu nichts weiß. Als einziger, lebendiger, reinblütigerDicloniuswird sie auch die ""Königin"" der Diclonii"" genannt und ist somit als Einzige in der Lage, weitere reinblütige Diclonii zu gebären."
Who was Kaede's mother?,Kaede wuchs in a Waisenhausauf,Kindheit (kaede),"Kaede wuchs in einemWaisenhausauf. Deshalb hatte sie weder ihre Mutter, noch ihren Vater kennengelernt. Sie hatte sehr oft Fieber und war allen Lehrern und Kindern unheimlich. Im Heim wurde sie außerdem stets wegen ihrer Hörner aufgezogen und es wurden ihr zum Teil sehr fiese Streiche gespielt. Kaede jedoch schien das alles kalt zu lassen. Auch wusste sie zu der Zeit noch nicht, welche Kräfte in ihr steckten. Da keines der anderen Kinder im selben Zimmer schlafen wollte, war sie trotzdem sehr einsam. Kaede trifft den kleinen Hund Doch eines Tages fand sie einen kleinen Hund, der sich immer am Waldrand herumtrieb. Diesen fütterte sie, doch sie verbot ihm, näher ans Heim heran zu laufen, da sie befürchtete, dass die anderen auch so gemein zu ihm wären wie zu ihr. Als drei Jungs aus dem Heim, die Kaede meistens all die gemeinen Streiche spielten, ihr sauere Milch über die Schultasche kippten und ihr ihren Stuhl wegzogen, verpetzte jedoch ein anderes Mädchen aus dem Heim diese an die Lehrer, um Kaede zu helfen. Sie versprach, immer zu ihr zu halten. Kaede zeigte ihr den Hund, der ihr treuester Gefährte war und sie immer tröstete. Das Mädchen schwor, den Hund nicht zu verraten, tat es aber, da sie insgeheim Kaede in Wirklichkeit auch fertig machen wollte. Die drei Jungs fingen den kleinen Hund ein und schlugen ihn mit einer Blumenvase vor Kaedes Augen tot. Aus Wut darüber ließ Kaede ihre Kräfte zum ersten Mal frei und tötete die Jungs mitsamt des Mädchens mit ihrenVektoren. Kouta und Kaede Nach dem Vorfall verschwand sie aus dem Waisenhaus. Bald darauf traf sie aufKouta, mit dem sie nach anfänglichem Zögern viel Zeit verbrachte und Spaß am Leben fand. Jedoch verbrachte Kouta nur seine Ferienzeit dort, sodass er bald wieder abreisen musste. Als sie ihn fragte ob er mit ihr, an seinem letzten Tag, auf einjährliches Festgehen würde, sagte er, dass er nicht könne, da er es schon jemand anderem versprochen hatte. Als Kaede nach dem Geschlecht jenes anderen fragte, log Kouta, um sie nicht eifersüchtig zu machen. Kaede beschloss ihn trotzdem dort zu treffen, um sich zu verabschieden und sah ihn mitYuka.

Im Grunde genommen ist ihr Dicloniusinstinkt die Stimme ihrer DNS, die ein jeder Diclonius hört. Sie sagte zu. ihr: • ""Du bist nicht wie andere, wann begreifst du das endlich? In dieser Welt, so wie sie ist, gibt es keinen Platz für dich oder mich."" Kaede fragte: • ""Ja, aber wa-warum bin ich denn überhaupt hier?"" Dicloniusinstinkt und Kaede Ihr Dicloniusinstinkt antwortete: • ""Ganz einfach, du bist hier um diese Welt zu deiner und meiner zu machen, du brauchst mir bloß die Hand zu reichen, und ich verspreche dir, ich werde dir die Kraft dazu geben. Es liegt bei dir, willst du weiterhin verachtet werden, bis du irgendwann tot getreten wirst wie dein Hund... oder hilfst du mir eine Welt in der Platz für uns ist zu erschaffen?"" Kaede sagte: • ""Leb wohl Kouta, ich hab dich wahnsinnig gern gehabt."" Lucy vor ihrem Tod Hier wird ihr Hass auf Menschen, Sadismus und Selbsterhaltungstrieb besonders deutlich, durch welchen sie stark kennzeichnet ist. Sie kann, im Gegensatz zuNyuu, Kaedes Körper nicht übernehmen, sondern nur zu ihr sprechen. Sie ist jedoch sehr überzeugend, da Kaede die Schmerzen nicht länger ertragen will.

Statt sie zur Polizei zu bringen, nehmen sie Nyu mit in dasMaple Inn. Auf dem Stand eines Kleinkindes, kennt Nyu anfangs weder Sittlichkeit noch Scham, lernt jedoch viel von Kouta, Yuka und den späteren Mitbewohnern. Im Manga ist sie später sogar in der Lage, ganze Sätze zu formulieren. Wird sie gewaltsam attackiert oder ist starken emotionalen Schlägen ausgesetzt, übernimmt Kaede wieder die Kontrolle über ihren Körper. Nyuu ist in gewisser Weise die Persönlichkeit, die Kaede gerne hätte, um unter Menschen, vor allemKouta, leben zu können. Im Manga wird sie als Kaedes ""pure"" Persönlichkeit beschrieben, das heißt, frei von den EinflüssenLucys. Nyuu ist ein sehr fröhliches, liebevolles und gewaltloses Wesen und steht in direktem Kontrast zu Lucy. Nyu schneidet Kaedes Haare ab, da sie unterbewusst eine Schuld an dem Tod Koutas SchwesterKanaeverspürt und dieser möglichst ähnlich sehen will, um Koutas Traurigkeit, über den Verlust Kanaes, zu vertreiben. Nyu kann nicht von anderenDicloniiaufgespürt werden, da sie keineVektorenoder sonstige Eigenschaften eines Diclonius aufweist. Zu Ende des Mangas schafft sie es jedoch, die Vektoren zu benutzen, als sie vonKakuzawainLesborngefangen gehalten wird. Ob andere Diclonii zu diesem Zeitpunkt in der Lage waren, sie zu spüren, ist nicht bekannt, da Kaede kurz darauf wieder die Kontrolle übernahm. Nach ihr benennen Yuka und Kouta ihreTochter."
What is the name of Kaede?,Lucy,Anime,"Kaedeist die Protagonistin der Geschichte. Wie alleDiclonii, leidet Kaede seit ihrer frühen Kindheit an einer gespaltenen Persönlichkeit. So besteht sie anfangs aus zwei Persönlichkeiten: Kaede/Lucy und ihr Dicloniusinstinkt, welcher sie zu manipulieren versucht. Lucyist der Name, den Kaede im geheimenForschungszentrumbekommt und Kaedes Persönlichkeit nachdem sie es aufgab, sich ihrem Instinkt zu widersetzen. Lucy ist keine von Kaede abgespaltene Persönlichkeit, sie ist Kaede, die sich nun bewusst von ihrem Dicloniusinstinkt leiten lässt. Sie ist auch das kleine Mädchen, das Kaede war, welches die Menschen hasste. Dies ändert sich auch nach all den Jahren nicht. Ihr Dicloniusinstinkt kann, anders als Nyuu, Kaedes Körper nicht übernehmen, weswegen sie nur zu ihr spricht. Sie ist jedoch sehr überzeugend, da Kaede die Schmerzen nicht länger ertragen will. Sie schafft es am Ende des Mangas jedoch aus Selbsterhaltungstrieb zweimal Kaedes Körper zu übernehmen. Als Lucy wurde sie die meiste Zeit ihres Lebens in dem Forschungszentrum festgehalten, mit der Absicht, sie nach der Vernichtung der Menschheit für die Bevölkerung der Erde mit reinblütigen Diclonii zu benutzen. Nyuuist neben dem Dicloniusinstinkt eine weitere gespaltene Persönlichkeit von Kaede/Lucy, die jedoch alle anderen Persönlichkeiten vollständig unterdrückt. Nyuu ist bei ihrem ersten Auftritt etwa auf dem Stand eines Kleinkindes, da sie sich mit nichts auskennt und alles neu lernen muss. Ursache der plötzlichen gespaltenen Persönlichkeit ist die Kopfverletzung, die sie durch den Scharfschützen bei ihrer Flucht aus dem Labor erhielt. Sie verlor vorübergehend ihr Gedächtnis und entwickelte eine kindliche Persönlichkeit, die nur in der Lage war, ""Nyuu"" zusagen. Obwohl ihr Dicloniusinstinkt mit Kaede/Lucy interagieren kann, ist die gespaltene Persönlichkeit Nyuu autonom und hat zunächst keine Kenntnis von Kaede/Lucy oder dem Dicloniusinstinkt, wie auch umgekehrt Lucy von Nyuu nichts weiß. Als einziger, lebendiger, reinblütigerDicloniuswird sie auch die ""Königin"" der Diclonii"" genannt und ist somit als Einzige in der Lage, weitere reinblütige Diclonii zu gebären."

Da keines der anderen Kinder im selben Zimmer schlafen wollte, war sie trotzdem sehr einsam. Kaede trifft den kleinen Hund Doch eines Tages fand sie einen kleinen Hund, der sich immer am Waldrand herumtrieb. Diesen fütterte sie, doch sie verbot ihm, näher ans Heim heran zu laufen, da sie befürchtete, dass die anderen auch so gemein zu ihm wären wie zu ihr. Als drei Jungs aus dem Heim, die Kaede meistens all die gemeinen Streiche spielten, ihr sauere Milch über die Schultasche kippten und ihr ihren Stuhl wegzogen, verpetzte jedoch ein anderes Mädchen aus dem Heim diese an die Lehrer, um Kaede zu helfen. Sie versprach, immer zu ihr zu halten. Kaede zeigte ihr den Hund, der ihr treuester Gefährte war und sie immer tröstete. Das Mädchen schwor, den Hund nicht zu verraten, tat es aber, da sie insgeheim Kaede in Wirklichkeit auch fertig machen wollte. Die drei Jungs fingen den kleinen Hund ein und schlugen ihn mit einer Blumenvase vor Kaedes Augen tot. Aus Wut darüber ließ Kaede ihre Kräfte zum ersten Mal frei und tötete die Jungs mitsamt des Mädchens mit ihrenVektoren. Kouta und Kaede Nach dem Vorfall verschwand sie aus dem Waisenhaus. Bald darauf traf sie aufKouta, mit dem sie nach anfänglichem Zögern viel Zeit verbrachte und Spaß am Leben fand. Jedoch verbrachte Kouta nur seine Ferienzeit dort, sodass er bald wieder abreisen musste. Als sie ihn fragte ob er mit ihr, an seinem letzten Tag, auf einjährliches Festgehen würde, sagte er, dass er nicht könne, da er es schon jemand anderem versprochen hatte. Als Kaede nach dem Geschlecht jenes anderen fragte, log Kouta, um sie nicht eifersüchtig zu machen. Kaede beschloss ihn trotzdem dort zu treffen, um sich zu verabschieden und sah ihn mitYuka.

What was Kaede Kota's profession?,zoologist,Persönlichkeit,"Kota interessierte sich schon für immer für Tiere. Bei seinen ersten Konversationen mitKaedeschlug dieser vor, in den Zoo zu gehen. Acht Jahre später entschied er sich Biologie zu studieren, da er trotz seines schlechten Gedächtnisses nicht seine Leidenschaft gegenüber Tieren verloren hat. Er war auch der erste Mensch, welcher über Kaede's Hörner staunte und diese nicht als Vorwand nutze, um sie zu verletzen. Nachdem Kaede Kotas Vater undKanaegetötet hat, kam Kota ein Jahr in Behandlung. Nachdem er sich von seinem Schock erholt hat, ließ ihm sein Gedächtnis bezüglich des Todes von Kanae und seinem Vater im Stich. Auch erinnerte er sich nicht anYukaund Kaede, nachdem er acht Jahre später zurückkehrte. Zwar erinnerte er sich sporadisch an Dinge aus der Vergangenheit, jedoch kehrte seine Erinnerung an Kaedes Taten erst zum Ende des Manges komplett zu ihm zurück. Kaedes Rache an Kouta Bevor Yuka ihm die Wahrheit erzählte, redete sich Kota ein, das Kanae sehr krank gewesen wäre und dabei gestorben sei. Schon als Kind, konnte Kota wohl gut mit Menschen umgehen, da er sich trotz Kaedes spöttischen Ton gut mit ihr Verstand. Also Kaede ihn fragte, ob er mit einem Mädchen oder einem Jungen zum Volksfest geht, dachte sich Kota, das Kaede sicher traurig wäre, wenn er ihr die Wahrheit verraten würde, also sagte er, er ginge mit seinem Cousin zum Volksfest, was jedoch eine Lüge. Er rechnete jedoch nicht mit Kaedes Zorn. Kota ist auch sehr faul und hat daher die Schule nicht perfekt absolviert. Als Konsequenz ging er auf die ""Bauernuniversität"" Kamakura. Meistens ist er sehr freundlich und hat meist auch einen optimistischen Blick auf die Welt, sollte es jedoch ernst werden, ist er meist auch sehr streng und abweisend."
What was the name of Kota's father?,Kanae,Kindheit,"Im ungefähren Alter von 10-12 Jahren, reiste Kota mit seinem Vater und seiner Schwester Kanae nach Kamakura, um den Sommer mit seiner Cousine Yuka und ihrer Mutter zu verbringen. Einige Zeit nach seiner Ankunft, entschied sich Kota die Berge zu erkunden. Während er die Berge mit seinerSpieluhrerkundete, traf er auf Kaede, welche damals noch ein junges Mädchen war. Nachdem Kota seine Spieluhr fallen lies, ertönte aus dieser eine Melodie. Anders als Kanae, meinte Kaede jedoch, dass sie die Melodie schön finde. Kota freute sich, dass sich auch jemand anderes fürLiliuminteressierte und bemerkte kurz darauf ihre Hörner auf dem Kopf. Anders als die Waisenkinder die Kaede zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch brutal gemobbt haben, reagierte Kota erstaunt auf die Hörner und fand sie cool. Er bot ihr schnell seine Freundschaft an, aber Kaede zeigte Misstrauen und Widerwillen gegen ihn. Da Kota nicht wusste, wie sehr die Menschen sie vorher verletzt haben, versprach er ihr, dass er am nächsten Tag zum selben Ort kommen würde. Leider war Kota nicht in der Lage sein Versprechen zu halten, da sein Vater ihn wegen der jüngsten Morde an Weisen in der Gegend nicht alleine rausgehen lassen wollte. Nach einiger Zeit, konnte sich Kota unbemerkt aus dem Haus schleichen um Kaede zu treffen, dessen Name er noch nicht zu diesem Zeitpunkt kannte. Kota erinnerte sich wieder an Kaedes Abneigung bezüglich ihrer Hörner und brachte ihr eine Wollmütze auf den Berg. Gerade als Kaede voller Wut weglaufen wollte, setze Kota ihr im letzten Moment noch die Wollmütze auf. Nach einem kurzen Gespräch verabredeten sie sich für den nächsten Tag wieder auf dem Berg. Für Kota war das eine bloße Freundschaft zu jemanden, der sich von seinen jetzigen Freunden unterschied. Für Kaede war das jedoch eine neue Erfahrung.... Erneut wegen der neusten unerklärlichen Morde, wollte Kotas Vater Kota nicht rauslassen. Am letzten Tag ihres Urlaubs bat Kota seinen Vater erneut nach draußen zu gehen, um jemanden zu treffen. Das eine mal erlaubte Kotas Vater Kota rauszugehen, um diesen ""jemanden"" zu treffen. Kota ging zurück zum üblichen Ort, wo er tatsächlich Kaede traf, welche die letzten drei Tage auf ihn gewartet hatte. Kota beschloss mit Kaede in den Zoo zu gehen. Anfangs behauptete sie zwar, dass Tiere sie nicht interessieren würden, was jedoch nicht ganz richtig war. Kaedes große Faszination an Tieren, die sie niemals gesehen hatte, überrasche Kota. Aber er freute sich über ihre Freude und kaufte ihr ein Eis. Sie genossen den ganzen Tag, was dazu führte, dass Kaede starke Gefühle für Kota entwickelte. Beide waren enttäuscht, dass ihre gemeinsame Zeit ein Ende fand. Dann hat Kaede jedoch gefragt, ob der Cousin, mit dem Kota auf das Fest geht, ein Mädchen oder ein Junge sei. Nichtsahnend sagte Kota, dass es ein Junge sei, um ihre Gefühle nicht zu verletzten. Letztendlich hat sich das aber als Fehler offenbart."
What is the difference between the manga and the anime?,"Kouta Lucy at the end erschießt, da sie ihn darum bittet.",Unterschiede zwischen manga und anime,"Sowohl im Manga als auch im Anime erinnert sich Kouta daran, dass Lucy seine Schwester und seinen Vater getötet hatte. Jedoch reagiert er im Anime anders als im Manga. Im Manga verabscheut er Lucy dafür, als seine Erinnerungen wiederkehren. Später jedoch, nachdem sie ihm ihre Geschichte erzählt hat, bietet er ihr an wieder im Maple Inn zu wohnen, wenn sie versprechen könnte, nie wieder zu töten. Im Anime jedoch vergibt er ihr sofort. Auch wird im Manga erwähnt, dass er aufgrund seines Traumas dachte, Kanae wäre an einer Krankheit gestorben.

Diese war so stark, dass Nana gegen eine Wand geschleudert wurde und sich eine Verletzung an der Stirn zuzog. Obwohl sie im Grunde nur darum bemüht war, Lucy freundlich zu überzeugen, wurde Nana wütend darüber, dass sie angegriffen wurde.

Diese Unachtsamkeit ermöglichte es Lucy, Nanas rechtes Bein und die Finger ihrer linken Hand abzutrennen. Mayu schlug sie mit einem Vektor ohnmächtig und verfrachtete sie mittels Vektoren in die Baumkrone eines in der Nähe befindlichen Baumes. Dann ging sie zu Nana und riss ihr beide Arme und beide Beine aus, da diese keine Schwäche zeigen wollte und behauptete, es würde nicht schmerzen.

Er griff sie mit einer Pistole an, deren Kugeln sie mit ihren Vektoren nicht so einfach abwehren konnte, und schaffte es so, sie leicht an der Stirn zu verletzen. Danach eröffnete er Nana, dass sie nicht auf diese Welt gehöre und ihr Vater sie wahrscheinlich nur loswerden wollte. Nana verzweifelte deshalb und ihre DNS übernahm sie. So besiegte sie Bandou sehr schnell, bekam jedoch einen Streifschuss von ihm, bevor der Schuss seinen künstlichen Arm zerstörte, und nahm so wieder ihr normales Selbst an. Als sie sah, dass Bandou auch eine Prothese durch Lucy tragen musste, erzählte Nana ihm, dass sie ihre Prothesen ebenfalls wegen Lucy hätte.

Die ersten Versuche, im Haushalt mitzuhelfen, scheiterten kläglich und eine Misere folgte auf die andere. Als Taugenichts in der Hauswirtschaft zu gelten, musste Nana vorerst hinnehmen, konnte dafür aber leichtere Aufgaben wie beispielsweise das tägliche Füttern vonWantaansteuern. Während desOVA-Specialswurde ihre Fehlerhaftigkeit in der Organisation und im Handwerken offenbar. Dies ging sogar soweit, dass sie sich weigerte, die Aufgabe des Putzens zu übernehmen. Wenngleich Kouta wusste, wie schlecht es um Nanas Verbleib stand, konnte er Nanas Arbeitsverweigerung nicht akzeptieren und drohte damit, sie aus der Wohngemeinschaft auszuschließen. Mayu versuchte dies um jeden Preis zu verhindern, schließlich ging es auch um ihre Freundschaft mit Nana.

What is Tsunemori's personality like at the time of her recruitment?,shy and nave,Personality,"She appears to be shy and naïve at the time of her recruitment, as well as quite idealistic. She agonizes over the purpose of her existence, which is an uncommon trait when compared to the other characters. As time goes on, however, Tsunemori reveals herself to be intelligent, insightful. patient and compassionate as an Inspector. Despite being generally polite and respectful, she can be headstrong, growing angry or upset with others for doing things with which she disagrees philosophically.[3]She is shown to be humble, as seen when she tellsYayoi Kunizukashe is being overly considerate when the Enforcer says she would put her life in her hands.[6] After spending time with the members of Division 01, Tsunemori develops into a full-fledged detective, albeit tempered by her personal sense of justice. An example of this is when she is unable to killShogo Makishimanot once, but twice: the first time leading to the death of a friend[7]and the second time preventing her from avenging said murder.[8]Yet, she still tries to bring him in alive instead of exacting revenge.[9] Tsunemori develops a more detached approach to investigation, as shown when she calmly uses her negotiation skills to talk down a criminal using bombs to attack the PSB, pushing hiscrime coefficientunder 300, thus allowing her to stun him in order bring him in instead of killing him.[5]However, when said bomber commits another crime and murders over a dozen people, she outright tells him that any sympathetic words she might tell him are now meaningless, and she is prepared to give the execution order when InspectorRisa Aoyanagitakes him down. After having the true form of theSibyl Systemrevealed to her, Tsunemori is shown to be hateful towards it but agrees to maintain it, knowing that the current society cannot live peacefully without it. She tolerates its existence because she believes the system will be terminated in the future. She is, on the other hand, capable of contradicting Sibyl at times, as seen when she attempts to bring inKirito Kamuialive despite the system wanting him dead, so she can learn why he's considered a societal threat. Despite everything she has experienced, Tsunemori maintains a healthyPsycho-Passand is quick to recover from any traumatic event, such as the aforementioned death of her friend and the death of her grandmother. While others view it as the result of a strong ego and the Sibyl System deems her a ""unique individual,"" Tsunemori believes that it means she's cold-hearted and unfeeling, and she is disturbed with how quickly she gets over these events.[10] She is seen inPsycho-Pass 3as a calm inmate at a rehabilitation facility where she is being held while awaiting her trial and judgement for ""endangering the public."" From there, she monitors the progress of InspectorsArata ShindoandKei Mikhail Ignatovas they pursue a truth they all hope to reveal. By the end ofFirst Inspector, Tsunemori is happy to be released and made a statutory Enforcer, once more working alongside several of her former colleagues, as personal aide to Chief Shimotsuki."

Over time, Tsunemori learns that Ginoza's abruptness stems from his fear of seeing yet another Inspector/friend/family member demoted to Enforcer status.

As an Enforcer, he is subordinate to his childhood best friend,Nobuchika Ginoza, who is an Inspector and lead officer. Although the two often seem at odds, they respect one another's judgment regarding police work. Kogami is cool-headed and detached while working a case with sharp instincts and insight into the criminal mind. The way he deals with investigations leaves even the best Enforcers impressed and appalled, as he usually uses risky methods to solve them. However, despite his mostly serious personality, Kogami has a sense of humor and finds it amusing to tease rookie Inspector,Akane Tsunemori, especially about how she once shot him with aDominatorduring her first assignment with Division 01.[2] In the past and while still an Inspector, he develops strong bonds with his Enforcers, one of whom is Kogami as an Inspector.

What is Ginoza's attitude towards Masaoka as an Enforcer?,loathing,Personality,"As an Inspector, he is an effective senior officer, capable of balancing the requirements of ChiefJoshu Kaseiand working efficiently with Division 01 personnel. He is an astute observer of human behavior and an excellent detective, but because he relies on data more than intuition, he comes off as somewhat rigid. This attitude also stems from his bitterness over Masaoka's latent criminal designation and demotion from Inspector to Enforcer while Ginoza is still a boy, shaping his view that Inspectors should not develop attachments to Enforcers since such ties will cloud one's own Psycho-Pass. Thus, he maintains his distance and considers the Enforcers to be ""hounds"" ‒ as they are called ‒ with himself as their ""shepherd"" ‒ as Inspectors are called. Ginoza behaves in a contrary manner towards Masaoka, but alsoShinya Kogami, his former colleague and childhood friend. His coolness stems from both men having once been detectives now demoted to Enforcers, which he sees as personal betrayals. Despite his loathing of Masaoka as an Enforcer, Ginoza still craves his approval as a father. Furthermore, Masaoka's faith in Kogami incites feelings of jealousy and inferiority even though Ginoza's skills are equivalent. Masaoka to Ginoza:""You are my son, after all."" WhenAkane Tsunemorijoins Division 01, he warns her against becoming friendly with the Enforcers, though she does so anyway, particularly with Kogami. Ironically, Ginoza fears that Tsunemori will also be subverted, though it is he who begins to stumble in his job performance. When hisHuebegins to grow cloudy, he ignores advice to seek treatment and continues to focus on work. His complex emotions, combined with the pressures of the job and the burden of keeping his Psycho-Pass clear, wrack Ginoza with deep anxiety leading to emotional exhaustion. The violent and untimely death of Masaoka creates an emotional upheaval in Ginoza's psyche, resulting in a sharp rise in hisCrime Coefficientto 140 and his designation as a latent criminal. Ginoza enters treatment but leaves after only two months, returning to the CID as an Enforcer working under the trainee he used to supervise, Akane Tsunemori. As an Enforcer, Ginoza exhibits significant changes both as an individual and as a law enforcement agent. Beneath a cool exterior, Ginoza is shown to have a compassionate side and is protective of those with whom he works, grieving when family and friends suffer or die. It is unknown how he actually feels about his demotion, but he is well-suited to the straightforward work of an Enforcer. Following the events of thegekijoubanon Shambala Float andSinners of the System Case.1, Ginoza is recruited byFrederica Hanashiroto work in theMFA Operations Departmentas part of its Suppressing Action Department which investigates crimes that cross the borders ofJapan. His excellent detective skills, coupled with Enforcer training, make him a highly trained professional who, inPsycho Pass 3, is seen as a behind-the-scenes force aidingAkane Tsunemori's quest for truth."

What is Hild's relationship to Thorfinn?,a part of Askeladd's band,Friends,"After they arrive in Vinlandand meet the Lnu, Thorfinn and Einar increasingly disagree with maintaining non-violent peace. During an attack by the Lnu that was ultimately provoked by the Nords, Einar kills a Lnu man. Einar is mortified and Thorfinn is able to deduce what happened just from the look in Einar's eyes. When they first met, Thorfinn was a part of Askeladd's band and killed her father as the main objective of their mission at the time. Having accomplished his task, Thorfinn coldly told Hild to run before his comrades find her and rape her. Too shocked to process his warning, other members of Askeladd's band appeared and chased her. Hild fell off an edge during the chase and Thorfinn coldly dismissed her, believing her to be dead. When they meet again as young adults years later, Hild recognizes his name and overall appearance. She tells her story to Thorfinn's group and Thorfinn's horrified response confirms her suspicion that he is the same Thorfinn she met. After trying to kill him, she agrees to spare him from her revenge to watch him attempt to atone for his past but promises to kill him if he strays from it. Hild then insists on following Thorfinn everywhere and constantly warning him of her threat. The closest she comes to accomplishing this is when Thorfinn meets Floki after learning that he was the one responsible for Thors's death. However, over the next few years, it becomes clear that her hatred of him has declined after witnessing Thorfinn's various acts and behaviors that contradict his past self. In Vinland, she finally lets of her grudge and forgives Thorfinn, accepting him as having worked hard to atone for his violent past. She calls Thorfinn a true warrior and the two finally become friends. Afterwards, her interactions with Thorfinn are much friendlier and she is more relaxed in his presence. She becomes one of his closest advisors regarding issues in Arnheid Village and demonstrates great loyalty to him. When they are attacked by the Lnu, Hild chooses to stay and help him in contrast to the past where she stayed to monitor him. When conflict is inevitable between Arnheid Village and the natives, Hild remained loyal to Thorfinn and his conviction against violence, to which even Einar opposed in the given circumstances. When Thorfinn is nearly killed, she carries him away and helps save his life. While Thorfinn recovers from near fatal injuries from the Lnu, she worries about him and asks him to take it easy."
What is Askeladd's last words to Thorfinn?,encouraging Thorfinn to move beyond himself and Thors and to become a true warrior,Others,"Thorfinn gained an intense hatred for Askeladd after he had his father Thors killed. Swearing vengeance, Thorfinn joined his band for chances to kill Askeladd in fair single combat. This hatred leaves Thorfinn unwilling to take advice from Askeladd that would improve his skills and possibly lead Thorfinn to actually kill him. During his years with Askeladd, the two form a twisted parental-like relationship. Askeladd is shown to quietly care for Thorfinn to a degree, and eventually begins to encourage him to do other things in life rather than be trapped in his desire for revenge. He also hints that Thorfinn might not hate him as much as it appears, contrasting Thorfinn's many years of attempts to himself when he killed his own father after just two years of learning how to fight. When Askeladd sacrifices himself to save Canute and his beloved homeland of Wales, he tells Thorfinn to stay back as he is fatally wounded. Thorfinn has a mix of panic and rage as Askeladd bleeds out, having a combined sentiment of wanting to kill him and save his life. Askeladd spent his last moments encouraging Thorfinn to move beyond himself and Thors and to become a true warrior, which leaves Thorfinn in silence. Thorfinn's first action after Askeladd's death is to attack Canute, who dealt the mortal blow. Years later, when asked by Einar if he still hates Askeladd, Thorfinn says no, remembering Askeladd's last words to him. Unable to escape from Snake, a vision of Askeladd persuades Thorfinn to accept using violence as a means to protect instead of harm. Thorfinn then chooses to fight Snake so Arnheid can escape. When talking with Canute to stop attacking the farm, Canute recognizes Thorfinn exhibiting some of Askeladd's attitude and mannerisms, causing him to nostalgically asked which of the two men Thorfinn took after more. Thorfinn later uses Askeladd's tactic of provoking in when he was younger to defeat Garm. When talking to Leif before he leaves for Vinland, Thorfinn sees Thors and Askeladd standing alongside Leif, and acknowledges the three as his fathers due to their roles in raising him to become the man he became in the present."

How old was Askeladd when he was taken in by his father?,11,Appearance,"As a child, Askeladd's chin-length wavy light blond hair was parted in the middle and worn loose. His eyes were light blue. His eyebrows were already rather thick, flicking out upwards at the outer edges. He was always plastered black and white with residue from his various jobs, earning himself the nickname of ""the Ashen Lad"". Askeladd wore trousers and a short-sleeved tunic belted over a long-sleeved shirt with a piece of fabric. Being very poor, his clothing was frayed and dirty, and he wore no footwear. After being taken in by his father at the age of 11, Askeladd is noticeably cleaner and wears nicer clothing. His appearance is similar when he arrives on the shores of Wales at age fourteen, though his hair is shorter and less noticeably parted. Askeladd in his early 20s can be seen in a very brief flashback, likely at the Battle of Maldon in 991. He looks much the same as he does later in adulthood, including his clothing, though his goatee does not include a moustache. Adult Askeladd is first seen in the present-day Vinland Saga timeline in his early 30s. As an adult, Askeladd is an average-sized Viking warrior, standing at 170cm and weighing in at 65kg. He is muscular but lean, an expected build for such a fast man, though his stature belies his incredible strength. His eyes are light blue, and his hair remains light blond in adulthood, telling of his Welsh and Danish heritages. He wears it short and slicked back. His eyebrows are thick and flicker upwards at the outer edges, and he styles his facial hair in a small, neatly groomed goatee. Askeladd's other features include heavy eyelids , prominent cheekbones, sunken cheeks, an aquiline nose and a creased brow. He is often shown frowning, cocking one eyebrow, and/or wearing a sly smirk, often showing teeth. Adult Askeladd is typically pictured in the same warrior's outfit: a light, cowl-neck gambeson with detailing on the sleeve fringes , belted over a dark long-sleeved shirt tied at the wrists, dark trousers, and dark boots hitting right below the knee. He typically wears an impressive dark breastplate, reminiscent of the Roman tradition, as well as a scabbard and his sword at his left hip. He occasionally wears a dark capelet and gloves, and a heavier long cape in colder weather. As he grows older throughout the series, Askeladd's widow's peak becomes more pronounced as his hair thins, leading Thorfinn to occasionally call him names such as ""baldy"" and ""pointy hair"". His face also becomes more heavily lined as he approaches his mid-40s. After the battle against his own men, he gains a visible scar above his right eye."
What was Askeladd's mother's name?,Welsh,Personality,"Askeladd is a sly, manipulative, cunning and charismatic man. Being an excellent swordsman, he is a great fighter, his biggest strength however lies in his intelligence and ability to strategize and adapt, a skill bolstered by his ability to know what kind of person someone is simply by looking at their face. He is quick to act and seize what he wants, yet slow to anger. As a captain, his bands look up to him as a bold and lucky person worthy of leading. Askeladd took care of his mother from a very young age, living in squalor and working very hard with no complaint. Witnessing how his mother and her people were mistreated by the Norse and the English led Askeladd to despise his Scandinavian heritage and to embrace the Romano-Celtic heritage of his mother. He grew up with his mother telling him of their ancestor Artorius and how the great hero would someday come back to save their people from their plight, a belief he wistfully holds on to in adulthood . From a young age, Askeladd shows his ability to plan ahead, convincingly play a role, and patiently wait for his opportunity to strike. He is an expert at maintaining a facade, typically acting arrogant and giving off the impression of simply being bored, amused, unaffected or entertained by the things happening around him. This often allows him to lower the guard of his foes, thus giving him the opportunity to shape the situation to his advantage and seize victory. As a Viking, Askeladd seems to hold remuneration and riches in high esteem, whether it be for their own sake, for amusement, or as a means to an end. He is not above using underhanded methods to reach his goals, even if that includes breaking a Warrior's Oath. He uses violence and murders with no hesitation if it is of benefit to him and his plans. He is often cold-hearted: unbothered by seeing his own men dying in battle ; coldly ordering the massacre of an entire village full of defenseless people; denying a dying man's last request after ordering his assassination; and seemingly not caring if Thorfinn dies. Askeladd however also seems to have a less dark side. He avenged the person he saw as partially responsible for his mother's misery and cared for her until her death, remaining easily angered by taunts to her station even decades later. He cares for the welfare of the people of Wales, scheming to keep them safe from both the Norse and the English. Unlike the rest if his Viking band, he does not seem to revel in violence simply for violence's sake outside of battles and duels, or to seek some of the typical indulgences of the Viking lifestyle — he is never shown drunk, fighting for no purpose, or claiming women after raids. He sends Atli off with advice and a golden bracelet despite he and his brother Torgrim turning on him previously and gives the dying Bjorn a warrior's death by granting him a duel. When Bjorn tells Askeladd he just wanted to be his friend, Askeladd allows him to know he really was his only friend before he dies. After being forced to kill King Sweyn in order to save both Canute and Wales, a fighting Askeladd yells at Thorfinn to stay out of things, a moment of inattention that costs him his life. His last words to Thorfinn are wise advice rather than taunts. He tells him to let go of things and move on, and that his real battle is to be a true warrior and go farther than Thors did."
How old was Askeladd when he was enslaved by Olaf?,eleven years old,History,"Askeladd is the son ofLydia, a Welsh noblewoman who was captured and enslaved by his Danish Viking father,Olaf. Due to being an illegitimate child, Lydia's son wasn't given a proper name by his father and, although Lydia gave him the nameLucius Artorius Castusafter their ancestor, he was still considered nameless. Although Lydia was Olaf's favorite for some years, when her health failed, she was relegated to the stables and thus her son had to work from a very young age to provide for them both. Lydia's child would receive the nickname ""Askeladd"" from the fact that he would always be covered in ashes and manure. Lydia often told Askeladd stories about their ancestor King Artorius, the great Roman hero, as well as her belief that Artorius was healing from his wounds in Avalon so that he could return and free his people of their suffering. When Askeladd was eleven years old, Lydia finally lost her mind carried a sheet over her head and walked through the village. When Lydia came across Olaf, she confused him for the savior Artorius and clung onto him in joy. As Olaf is about to kill Lydia, Askeladd realizes that the hero Artorius will never return and that only a normal person could save his mother. With no other option Askeladd grabs a sword and fights his father. Despite never swinging a sword before, Askeladd claimed that it felt completely natural wielding the blade, and put on a commendable display, but was still defeated. By the end, Olaf realizes that Askeladd is one of his children and decides to take him out of slavery, having taken an interest in the son he never knew until now. For two years, Askeladd feigned warming up to his father while hiding his murderous intent, such as showing Olaf proper respect, recognizing the former as his savior from slavery and even learning to get along with his half-brothers. Ultimately, Askeladd snuck into Olaf's bedchamber while the chieftain was asleep beside one of his concubine slaves and killed the pair with a sword stolen from his half-brother. With one of his half-brothers being framed for the murder and being executed, Askeladd was able to get away with his revenge and was given the right to inherit his property. A year after his father's death, Askeladd traveled to and visited Wales to bring Lydia back home and met Welsh GeneralGratianusfor the first time. Lydia would die soon after returning to her homeland. Askeladd would spend the next 19 years as a Danish Captain, leading a band of Mercenary Vikings, while still holding a deep-seated hatred for Vikings and the Danes, despite being both of those things himself, while waiting for Artorius or anything else to change the world."
What is the final destination of all warriors?,Valhalla,Aftermath,"Askeladd continues to have an impact on Thorfinn after his death. He often appears in Thorfinn's dreams and nightmares, as noted byEinar, who hears Thorfinn scream out Askeladd's name while in the throes of a nightmare. Thorfinn tells Einar of Askeladd, saying he was the man that killed his father, and that he was a very strong but cruel man. He continues, saying he followed him into battle to get revenge, as he hated him enough to kill him, though he eventually got killed by someone else in front of him. Einar tells Thorfinn no good will come of hating the dead. Thorfinn, recalling Askeladd's last moments , tells Einar he no longer hates Askeladd, which makes it harder to deal with as he is empty now that his hatred is gone . Thorfinn eventually remembers his dream, seeing Askeladd there once again. Thorfinn hangs on to a cliff with great difficulty, with warriors waging battle underneath him. Askeladd, sitting on a tall pillar, greets Thorfinn, noting he never learns and always comes back. When Thorfinn asks him if this is Valhalla, he replies that it is the real world — where all the ""shit winds up"", the final destination of all warriors, an ultimate state of warfare with no winners, losers or end, where everyone is an enemy and where Thorfinn used to live. He explains that Thorfinn escaped, for better or worse, by getting ""hollowed out"", and that though he is in no position to say so as the man who dragged him there in the first place, that Thorfinn is lucky he was one of the lucky few to leave. He inquiries about what fills Thorfinn now that being a warrior, which was all he was, has been drained away. As Thorfinn derails in negativity, he tells him to pay attention to his surroundings, including a tower of corpses reaching for him. Thorfinn kicks them and Askeladd says he should at least hear their curses, as they are all people he killed. As the corpses at the bottom start shooting arrows at Thorfinn, Askeladd hops off his pillar to fight them off. He yells at Thorfinn that now is no time for moping around, as he shouldn't want to end up back there. He tells him to let the corpses hang off of him and climb, that that is his true battle — to go, take those he killed with him, fight his true battle and become a true warrior, echoes of his last words to Thorfinn before his death. When Thorfinn wakes, he swears to never harm another person again and declares that he will make amends for his past deeds and be reborn . Thorfinn, who had recently sworn off violence, finds himself facing a fight withSnakeunless he gives up on helpingArnheidand hands overGardar. As he ponders how he could make it out of the situation without using violence, fighting or hurting anyone, he sees Askeladd next to him. This vision of Askeladd puts voice to his own concerns, rationalizations and conscience: he doesn't really have a choice, and the violence is justified if it's altruistic and has no lust or hatred behind it. Askeladd asks him if he will hold true to his oath of peace or surrender to the way of battle to save someone. He asks him which holds the path to being a ""true warrior"", and which he will choose . In 1019, when Thorfinn tries to fight offGarmatJomsborgwithout killing him, he uses several of Askeladd's tactics, first by verbally taunting Garm and manipulating him into giving in to anger to lead him to make mistakes . As Garm charges straight at him, he grabs him by the wrists and headbutts him, mirroring moves Askeladd had used on him. Thorfinn thinks it is a horrid thought that the things Askeladd taught him are what kept him alive. When Garm comes to, Thorfinn tells him that when the blood rushes to someone's head, their movements become quite simple as they become too fixated on the one mark they're attacking, a lesson he learned from Askeladd . When Thorfinn stops by Greenland for a few days before setting off forVinland, he spoke toLeif. Leif remarks he is all grown up and that Thors would be proud if he could see him now. When Leif tells him ""Follow your heart, my son"", Thorfinn sees a smilingThorsand a smirking Askeladd behind Leif ."
How old was Askeladd when he defended his mother from his father Olaf?,11,Abilities,"Master swordsman: Askeladd was a highly skilled swordsman, displaying a talent for this at age 11, when he defended his mother from his fatherOlaf. Despite being middle-aged at the time of his death, he survived combat against multiple opponents at once, including KingSweyn's royal guards. Ranged weapons: Askeladd had skill with throwing hatchets and throwing knives, although they were not his primary weapons. Leadership skills:Askeladd is also a master tactician as well as a skilled politician. His ability to manipulate those around him turned a horde of pirates and raiders into a close-knit group wholly loyal to him. He has shown himself capable of turning enemies into allies, as seen with Thorfinn, Thorkell, and Prince Canute. Intelligence:Askeladd could also instantly read a man just by looking at his face, an ability he claimed to have picked up from living 40 years among wicked men."
What is the name of Thor's rival?,Askeladd,Duels,"Askeladd versusThors Thors challenges Askeladd after recognizing Askeladd as the leader by his scent, and Askeladd proclaims they have the same scent. Askeladd starts the duel off by cutting the rope to the mast, in order to seemingly disappear to get a sneak attack in, however he only managed to graze Thors. They then swing their blades together and clash, until Askeladd notices Thors was aiming for his blade, in order to weaken and destroy it. Askeladd realises that this must mean that Thors’ blade must be just as weak, and let’s Thors hit his chest armour in order to shatter Thors’ blade. This, however, was all a part of Thors’ plan, in order to make Askeladd drop his guard and do a big swing with his sword. Thors swiftly hits Askeladd’s elbow, knocks his sword out of his hand, and takes it for his own. Thors then claims to have won the duel and throws the sword into the water below them. Askeladd admits to Thors winning the duel, but after Bjorn takes a young Thorfinn as a hostage, Thors is littered with arrows from above and killed. AskeladdversusThorfinn Note: These are Askeladd's known duels with Thorfinn. Others may have occurred."
Who is Canute's personal guard?,Thorfinn,Thorfinn,"By order of Askeladd, Thorfinn is put in charge of being Canute's personal guard.[10] Initially, upon meeting Thorfinn, Canute is frightened by him, immediately hiding behind Ragnar after being introduced.[11]However despite this Canute is found staring at Thorfinn on multiple occasions on their journey, seemingly interested in getting to know him better. This is not lost on Thorfinn as he starts prodding the prince to speak his mind after an encounter with the Welsh. Canute responds to Thorfinn, albeit with a noticeable stutter. Thorfinn teasingly refers to Canute as ""Princess"" which causes the young prince to spring up flustered. This is much to the surprise of Ragnar, as he notes that this is the first time Canute ever speaks to someone that isn't himself.[12]Making Thorfinn the first person Canute has spoken so openly to aside from Ragnar. Thorfinn is later referred to by Canute as a dear comrade, who pursues the same goal as him but albeit by a different path. Thorfinn also refers to Canute as the one responsible for making peace for the majority of people through necessary bloodshed, while he is responsible for creating peace for the rest through non-violence. Through their efforts, they believe peace will ultimately be obtained from the other helping those that they cannot. When Canute apprehends former Jomsviking commanders and is about to kill them, Thorfinn requests that they accompany him to Vinland to make his dream come true. While Thorfinn explains himself, Canute is again amused and pushes the former Jomsvikings to accept the offer."

What is the catchphrase of Vash?,This world is made of love and peace,Personality,"Vash displays throughout both the manga and the anime two very distinct personalities. Initially, Vash usually exaggerates foolish characteristics to make people feel un-threatened and to hide his identity, as well as using these outrageous actions and chronic kindness as a way to mask his own pain . He exhibits an almost obsessive love of doughnuts, engages in lecherous behavior, plays games with the local children and aids and befriends the adults, as well as making the occasional bizarre joke or quip . He frequently voices the catchphrase, ""This world is made of love and peace,"" which is usually complemented by his flashing of the ""V"" or Peace sign, much to the confusion of friends and acquaintances and the chagrin of his enemies. Vash's other side is an utterly tormented and lonely being and is rarely shown when he is in the company of others. Due to his long life and legendary reputation, Vash has lost both a great many friends and his only family. In several instances people he trusted have either betrayed him or been killed for simply knowing him. For the 20 years he was a hunted man and frequently had to hide his identity and fend off waves of persistent bounty hunters. Thus, he is often prone to brooding and depression whilst alone or engaging in deep introspective thought. A point of conflict in the series is the inner differences between Vash and Knives, his twin brother, and their regard for humanity. Despite his long-suffering and ill-treatment by human beings, Vash chooses to remain hopeful and loving toward humanity; whereas Knives has fallen into a deep-seated hatred of the entire race despite never personally suffering at their hands. Their personalities also have other key differences: Vash cannot stand the despair of being alone, whereas Knives revels in his loneliness and has no desire for any company other than Vash. Because Vash refuses to kill any of his opponents, he often suffers at the hands of a number of very unscrupulous enemies. As a result, his body is a patchwork of large scars, chunks of missing flesh supported by metal mesh, and stitch marks. Despite his hesitance to show his body , Vash never uses his power to remove them or repair his body, choosing to keep the scars as a reminder of the price he pays for his unlimited mercy."

What is the relationship between Meryl and Vash?,Vash hugs Meryl,Relationship with vash in the (anime 1998 version),"Vash hugs Meryl. Initially, she findsVashto be a nuisance and dismisses the idea that he is the legendary Humanoid Typhoon. As time passes, she realizes that Vash isn't the villain that he is made out to be nor the buffoon that he presents himself to be. Gradually, as the anime series progresses and she sees Vash get out of a variety of situations while displaying both a high level of skill and compassion, she comes to respect Vash. While at first chasing Vash is just her job, Meryl shows that she values their friendship- although she has a hard time admitting it to anyone until the end of the series, least of all herself. Milly often encourages her to go after Vash, telling her that what she is doing is right, and advises her ""not to hold back in matters of the heart."" Towards the later half the series, Meryl follows Vash out of her feelings for him more than her job. No matter how dangerous the situation, no matter how many times Vash tells them to stay away Meryl tries to follow Vash and Milly supports her- at least up until the point her life is seriously endangered, such as inFifth Moon. Meryl also states once that she would not run away from Vash because of his scars and does not seem to be bothered by them. Meryl constantly wonders why Vash gets into trouble when he does nothing wrong and worries about him as a result. One day, she is shocked to hear the truth and seems to understand this is something he has to solve alone. Later in a turning point for the two inLive Throughwhen the girls are taking care of him, Meryl expresses regret at following Vash, believing that he had to endure such emotional suffering because of them. For a time after Legato's death, Meryl takes care of a broken Vash by cooking, changing his bandages and sewing up his tattered red duster. One night while watching the stars together, Meryl tells him that he can stay there with them as long as he likes, and Vash agrees it may not be such a bad idea, which in turn makes Meryl happy. The next day it is Meryl who protects Vash from angry villagers who find out that he is Vash the Stampede. He sees Rem in her words, and her physical appearance. He then realizes what he needs to do to Knives and hugs Meryl, off-putting her with his first display of affection toward her. While she enjoys it at first, eventually Meryl asks how long this is going to last, to which Vash responds by screaming ""Oh, this is a great day!"" He then proceeds to swing her around and rub faces with her while laughing, scaring and annoying her until - in true Meryl fashion - she finally punches and leaves him in the dust. Vash sees similarities between Meryl and Rem. The next day as Vash leaves to fight Knives, Meryl is waiting for him outside. He thanks her sincerely for everything and she seems as if she is about to say something when Milly interrupts withWolfwood's Punisher. After Vash leaves, Meryl begins crying, stating that she could not say anything to him. Milly responds that she can do so when he gets back. Soon after, when the small town they are staying at hits water, Milly asks Meryl if she believes Vash is coming back, to which Meryl responds ""He wouldn't keep a good woman like me waiting"", indicating that she has accepted her feelings and is looking forward to his return."

What color is Akira's hair replaced by small black bat wings on each side of his head and his forehead extending to his crown turns red and grows a pair of antennae?,black,Appearance,"Akira is a teenager with black eyes and has prominent sideburns with short black hair that is combed forward. At first, he had a rather unimpressive build and stood at an average height of 172 cm , but after his transformation into Devilman, his physiology becomes more athletic and his stature grows to an imposing 186 cm [1]with black markings forming under his eyes as a result of Amon's influence. He is often seen dressed in his school uniform but also wears a black long sleeve shirt, pants, and shoes in other situations. As Devilman, he stands at approximately nine and a half feet tall and weighs roughly 220 kilograms [2]. His his hair replaced by small black bat wings on each side of his head and his forehead extending to his crown turns red and grows a pair of antennae. His lower body grows dark hair from the pelvic region down to his feet, and his hands and feet grow sharp claws on their digits. He also has a tail with an arrow-headed spade at the tip. Depending on the artwork, Akira's skin color remains the same as his human, gains a blue-green color hue, or most rarely is red. The sclera of Devilman's eyes is either empty white or yellow, which are said to be full of grief. When Devilman demands it, he can spot a pair of large bat-like wings from his back. In special Devilman Lady chapters, Akira's spirit sports a costume to interact with the real world, dubbed Devilman Ghost. Initially consisting of a skeletal Devilman mask, it is later given a black body suit with bone-like decorations including bone armored gloves and boots. It is also decorated with a cape."
What is the name of Akira's demon spider?,Zann,Abilities,"DEVILMAN Prior to turning into Devilman, Akira had some of the best grades in his classes and had impressive intellect, partly due to the fact that he spent most time reading. In terms of physical skills, Akira never thought of joining after school activities for his dislike of sports; as such he wasn't very physically fit. After his first transformation into his Devilman, he became much more physically powerful; having greater strength, speed, reflexes, and combat skills, being able to take onZann's demon spiders without worry. Devilman is able to continue fighting even after he lost an arm and had his stomach slashed open bySirene. His ferocious strength allows him to lift heavy objects, tear demons apart with his bare hands, break through barriers, and leap over buildings effortlessly. When Devilman grows his wings, he is able to fly. For various distances he can shoot beams from the antenna on his forehead. Some demons stated that he could even be a major threat to Zennon, although the two never managed to fight each other. In a few short instances, Devilman shows different powers that fit certain situations. One was shown when he was battlingGhelmer, shooting two beams of rays of intense heat from his palm of his hands. He can also release energy from his antenna but in a less focused way than his normal Devil Beam. These same antennae can create signals similar to those used by Sirene to control her fileable arms and used this technique to direct the arm into Sirene's stomach. He has the ability to teleport as shown when he rescued Miko. When Miki's parents are killed, Devilman breathed flames from his mouth on the killers with enough heat and force to burn them to ash in seconds. Another less seen ability is his power to phase through solid objects even through inches of hard steel. He is able to grow to great size which gives him an advantage when fighting smaller demons. As shown with other Devilman, Akira is able to communicate with other Devilman through telepathy but his is limited compared other Devilman. Like all Devilmen he is able to combine with living tissue. While this is never used in the manga, it was used at the end of the novel version to combine with the other Devilman Corps to assume a larger version of himself. In the 'Devilman Lady' manga, after spending a long time inHell, Akira's powers have heightened to extremes that rival even Satan's. He is able to release electric charges on enemies once he comes into contact with him or her. Devilman can also release energy at an opponent through heightened psychic abilities. For a limited amount of time, Devilman can leave Hell and interact with the physical world, but his actions are very limited without a physical body. He is able to look into a person's memories and for a short while appear visible to a person. He is also able to possess objects, most notably the Devilman Ghost costume made byJunand fight through said objects with impressive strength and psychic power that can effortlessly tear through enemies."
What caused Akira to become braver and more headstrong?,Devilman,Personality,"Before his initial transformation, Akira was kind and sweet, but cowardly and highly emotional at the same time. Much of the time, he used to cry in most of these situations. Shying out of any conflict or problems had caused those around him to think him as weak. After becoming Devilman, Akira became much braver and more headstrong, as well as perverse. Because of his originally weak will, his fusion with Amon however caused him to become far more brooding and violent. He was best friends with Ryo Asuka and had been since childhood , he was deeply protective of Ryo. Unknown to him for a long while, Ryo was in love with Akira. However, Akira didn't return the feelings of love and instead cared forMiki Makimurawho both shared romantic feelings for one another, much to Ryo's frustration. He cared deeply for his adoptive family who took him in after his parents were too busy to care for him. Before his transformation, Miki was often the only friend Akira ever had and despite being talked down by her for not standing up for himself, Akira genuinely cared about Miki enough for romantic love. Miki was also the biggest hope Akira had for humanity and it was her death that made Akira lose faith in it altogether. This made Akira put all his faith into Devilman because of their pure hearts, but some outer media brought out different paths including his memories of Miki keeping Akira from losing his own humanity to Amon. He later made friends with the gang that originally attacked him after he saved their life from an attacking demon, primarilyMasaandDosu-Roku. He was highly respected and looked up to by the other Devilmen, primarilyMassami Izumiand even more soMico, especially after he saved her life. Later on, in Devilman Lady, he befriendsJun Fudoas the two walks through the depths ofHell, during which Akira admits to Jun that he did in fact love Ryo, but whether this was platonic or romantic is unknown. Later on, during their time in Hell, Jun and Akira begin to fall in love and they have sex in mid-flight. Akira was upset when they could not be together, especially when he saw images of Jun suffering. But his will managed to manifest through a suit Jun made for him that allowed him to protect Jun from some threats she couldn't fight against. He was surprised upon coming back into the world through Satan and finding out Jun was half of Satan. Yet for some reason, he chose not to decline Satan's offer to join the battle against God. He is also shown to express sympathy for certain demons that he had killed when he was alive such as Sirene and Kaim, as well as pure hatred for others, especially the sadistJinmen."
What does Ryo tell Akira to put on?,mask,Devilman,"Akira is first seen walking home from his first day at his new school with Miki Makimura whose family he had recently moved in with. One the way however they are stopped byKen,GoandDosu-Rokuthree gang member, all of whom were all attracted to Miki and start teasing the two, Miki gets angered by them whilst Akira tries to keep everything cool, Miki slaps Ken and Meriken-Jo but is grabbed by a furious Dosu-Roku starts to try and undress her, whilst Akira is held back by the other two, luckily they are saved by the sudden and mysterious intervention of Ryo Asuka who threatens the gang with a highly illegal sawed-off shotgun. Ryo says that he needs to speak to Akira privately and Miki is forced to walk back by herself. On the way to Ryo's home, he reveals that hisfathercommitted suicide after killing his dogJohnand then attempted to kill Ryo, as they arrive at his home, he tells Akira that his father had been possessed by aDemon. At first Akira didn't believe his friends story but Ryo takes him to an empty room containing only a strangedemonic mask. Ryo tells him to put the mask on, he does so, and his mind is suddenly barraged with visions of Demons explaining their origins and powers and how they were escaping from their icy tomb. These images were projected by the demon known asPsycho Jennybut this was unknown to both Akira and Ryo at the time. After removing the mask Ryo says why he brought Akira here, he says that he wants Akira to become a warrior against the Demons to protect the human race. Akira at first thinks Ryo was insane for thinking of such an idea. Ryo tells him to think about it and drives him home. However, on the way they are attacked by the hordes of demons. They are forced to go back to Ryo's house; however, Ryo takes Akira into a hidden basement in his home, and Akira decides that he will become a demon warrior. Ryo then moves through the basement to reveal another hidden room and much to Akira's surprise is holding a massive party. Ryo says that he is planning to perform aBlack Sabbath, meaning he would have to cause much carnage within the room to summon the demons. Akira was hesitant to let people die and be overcome by such fearsome creatures in spite of their sinful nature. As Ryo starts stabbing people with a broken wine bottle, the partiers angrily start to beat them both up but unknown to them they were being possessed by demon starting with the she demonWelvath. They continue to transform and kill those who failed to do so, before surrounding Akira. But suddenly Akira blacks out and starts to become overtaken by the demonAmon. Akira's pure heart and soul dominates Amon and gains control of his body, turning into Devilman for the first time. He proceeds to kill every demon in the area. Suddenly remembering Ryo, he tries to find his friend only to see that Ryo had been crushed by a dead demon, and screams in pain over his friend's supposed death. A little while later Akira is seen mockingTareand Miki Makimura commenting on Miki's breasts swelling after having to many baths. She angrily retorts only to then go to pour another bath, Akira then suddenly leaves having sensed some trouble about to start. At the same time the she demonSirenearrives and lands on top of the Makimura residence and summons her two demon subordinatesGhelmerandAgwelas they attack the Makimura family. Realizing that the battle had begun Akira runs to find the Makimura's but is greeted by Tare who was running in panic after finding his parents embedded in the wall and ceiling. Akira tells Tare to hide and runs to rescue Miki from Ghelmer and Agwel who use all of their abilities to fight and trick Akira, with Ghelmer even using Miki as a puppet. Fortunately, Devilman manages to turn the tables on both demons, killing them. He sets Miki down on bed but still senses another demon. He is then attacked by Sirene who grabs Akira by her talons and flies into the sky. Akira struggles to get himself free as Sirene proceeds to crush him. Akira is saved by a recently awakened Ryo using a sniper rifle with Sirene losing her grip and Akira transforming into his Devilman form. Sirene knocks out Ryo with one of her claws as she grapples with Devilman. The two battles in mid-air before landing on the ground, Sirene's telekinesis proved to be a problem as she uses it attack Akira with trees and her detached arm that she uses it to cut through Akira's right arm and then impales it into his chest. Akira figures out that it was her antenna that were controlling the arm and uses his own antenna to fry the receptors in hers causing the arm to go out of control and impale her in her stomach, Akira then rips off her right wing grounding the demon. Sirene however is helped by other demons including her companionKaim. Akira takes out the other demons but now has to deal with Sirene's gestalt with Kaim. Badly wounded, Akira finally admits defeat and falls unconscious. Waking up in the morning however, he finds out that Sirene didn't take the final strike as she died from her wounds. Ryo had patched up Akira's wounds and reattached his arm. Akira then sees Sirene's frozen body in the sunlight, noticing that she died with a smile of victory upon her face, something which Akira remarks as being beautiful. After the battle with Sirene, Akira overhears his classmates talk about disappearances around Japan, Akira knowing that demons were the cause of it. At the top of the school's roof, Dosu-Roku's gang challenge him to a fight however in a matter of minutes they are all defeated by Akira and sprawled out across the roof. Later at the end of school Miki comes to find Akira only for the two to be cornered by Masa and his gang. However, Akira realizes that they had been possessed and hadn't merged with them, so he took care not to kill them. He crushes the spiders on the groups head freeing them from their possession. They thank him and agree to join him in his battle against the Demon race. However as soon as they get outside, they are surrounded by many of the school's more physical and strong students had also been possessed by the Spider Demons and start to attack them. Akira tells the gang to protect Miki while he goes to find the spider's control. The demonRasberhowever used a perfect copy of himself, he mocks Akira as he forms an image in the sky asZannthe demon general of theArmy of 100 Demonsissues his commands and taunts everyone. Rasber laughs at Akira and the others and retracts the Demon Spiders. He then attacks and wraps up Miki and the gang in his webbing, Akira battles Rasber and kills him quickly allowing the others to escape. After departing from the gang, Miki and Akira go back to the Makimura Residence where they encounter a small girl trying to reach for the doorbell. The girl's name wasSachikoand she was a friend of Akira's before he moved away to live with the Makimura's, Akira invites her inside although Miki and Sachiko immediately start to agitate each other. Akira later takes Sachiko to the train station and put her on the16:10 Shinkansenand tells her not to make such long journeys on her own anymore, she agrees and the two depart. However later that night, news of the 16:10 Shinkansen's disappearance is announced and almost as soon as Akira learns about this, he gets a mysterious phone call telling him to meet him at a local park and then tells him that his little friend was delicious and reveals himself asJinmenof Zann's troops. Akira barely retaining his anger flees the Makimura home and goes to a park that Jinmen told him to meet. After waiting around the park's playground a while, he sees the face of Sachiko. He calls out to her, she replies by saying ""I didn't want to die, I'm so young"" afterwards more screaming faces appear around her before a laugh is heard and the demon Jinmen reveals himself to Akira. After some brief dialogue the two battle one another but it is not long before that he damages one of the faces on Jinmen's back, shocked by its screams Akira freezes in his tracks. Jinmen then tells him that the faces upon his back are still alive as when he ate a living creature it would become one with his shell never dying. They continue to battle, but Jinmen gets the upper hand as Akira constantly misses trying not to hit the faces. However, Sachiko screams out to Akira and tells him to smash through her and destroy Jinmen. Begrudgingly he does so and smashes through Sachiko's eye and through Jinmen's chest. Jinmen starts to stumble around before Akira grabs him and rips off his shell, killing Jinmen, the faces on his back, and what was left of Sachiko. The next time Akira is seen, he breaks the fourth wall and addresses the reader. He tells them that this would no longer be his own drama but the whole world's, including the reader. He then fades away, and not much later the demon's start to go a suicide march merging into people's bodies at random causing many people to die or turn into demons. During the panic Ryo finds Akira, Ryo explains to him what the more intelligent demons were doing by sending the lesser demons to merge with perfectly lucid or normal people meaning they would die in the process. However, he also says that a few of the mergings would work but not many. Ryo panics at several thoughts including how humanity will wreak havoc about this. Akira doubts this saying humanity would not be so weak as they had courage that would conquer fear. However, he is sadly proved wrong when a news report showed the destruction of the city ofTsuringradwhich had just been obliterated with a hydrogen bomb, having been fired by the Soviet Union. The report goes on to say that it was necessary to stop the demons. A few days later Akira reads in a paper about a girl who accidentally killed her two friends with acids ejected from her body, the girls name wasMikiko Kawamoto. He starts to realize that there would be others like him and that he should form together an army ofDevilmento defeat the demons. Immediately after, he gets a phone call from Ryo telling him to look outside. He rushes out to see a gigantic four headed demon, the Demon KingZennon. Zennon announces himself across the world telling humanity that the demons were coming to retake the Earth and eradicate humanity just like they did the dinosaurs. He then announces that the attack will take place in five minutes before teleporting away. Akira realizes Zennon was the demon Amon had nightmares about previously. When he tells the Makimura's to go hold up in their home, he notices a collection of military vehicles go past. He runs inside the house to find Ryo. Ryo tells him that he shouldn't go out to right now, telling Akira to wait for a later fight. To demonstrate, Ryo opens the window to see a massive armada of flying demons across the Tokyo sky. Akira watches the carnage of the demons and decides to leave, Ryo tries to stop him, but Akira slaps him and leaves. Akira goes on a rampage and kills many demons; however, he eventually comes face to face with a demoness namedPsycho Jennywho uses her powers and knocks Akira unconscious. Suddenly a swarms of demons surround him, Jenny disappears, and the demons move in for the kill. But Akira is saved when the demon General Zann comes flying down and forbids them from killing him after receiving orders from his master, which to everyone's surprise was someonehigher than even Zennon. Later Akira later awakes to find himself in a bed bandaged with Ryo looking over him, Ryo turns on the TV and shows Kyoto burning in flames. Ryo berates him about having gone outside and tells him that humanity had no chance to destroy the Demons. Akira reveals to Ryo about the other Devilmen and about Satan being the true leader of the demons. The TV then suddenly switches showing the entirety of Russia absorbed in a blinding white light, as soon as Ryo sees this, as he screams in terror with Akira stunned by what just happened. Later that night Akira returns to the Makimura home and is glad to see it mostly undamaged. However, when inside, he sees several dead snakes around the home. Miki tells him they were attacked by a demon namedRosushido, however they were saved by the sudden arrival of Meriken-Jo and Dosu-Roku who kill the demon. Akiko comes through and tells them to watch the television saying that the government had discovered a way to defeat the demons, and the newly designedDemon Bustersare shown off to the world. Later after Akira had managed to gather together a small group of Devilman, Dosu-Roku comes running to him telling him about a young kid who they suspected to be a Devilman. After Dosu-Roku leaves Akira and the other Devilman join hands and attempt to psychically contact other Devilmen. Unfortunately, they are unsuccessful. They are suddenly mocked by a loud laughter who reveal themselves as theBonds of Hinduism, they tell them that they would help them and use their psychic abilities to contact the Devilman across the entire world. Akira is later seen lurking around the anti-demon labs where he grabsDr. Rainumathe man behind theAnti-Demon Special Corps, he demands to know where his fellow Devilman were. He takes him to Mikiko the girl Akira had earlier read about in the newspaper; he breaks her containment tube and tells her what she was before picking her up and flying her away to safety. A little while later Akira arrives at the Makimura home, where the family was waiting along with Dosu-Roku and Masa. Akira, who had had been searching for Ryo, arrives home after having searched for him for a long time. Miki tries to cheer him up and turns on the TV. It goes to the news, and it says that they were holding an interview with Ryo, who had something to share with the world. initially Akira thought that Ryo was going to prove Dr. Rainuma's theories false and explain the Devilman, however instead Ryo shows a videotape. The tape showed Akira's first transformation into Devilman, and at that the others run in fear, Kozo pulls a gun on him, and Miki runs in fear. He grabs ahold of Miki but is warded off by Kozo who tells him to get out, Akira tries to explain but starts to doubt even himself and begins to panic. However, he regains his senses and explains that he was Devilman and he retained his human heart and soul. After that, Kozo advises that he still leave as the Demon Busters would arrive soon, he thanks them before saying he would see Miki again soon before leaving. Unbeknownst to him, Kozo and Akiko are taken in his place by the Demon Busters for having harbored a demon. Akira later finds Ryo waiting for him as the sun was rising in some rubble. Ryo tells Akira that he should let him do what he wants. Akira, angry at Ryo's betrayal shouts at Ryo, but Ryo remains calm and tells him that a new age was coming soon. Akira calmly asks what he meant by this and decided whether or not he should kill him. Ryo tells him that the demons were no longer attacking and were taking a backseat as they watched humanity slowly crumble, continuing his new age. Akira then starts to realize something, not only was Ryo in league with the demons, but he was also the one masterminding things from the shadows, revealing that Ryo's deep and almost intimate knowledge about the demon race was because he had already witnessed firsthand what demon-kind was capable of before their hibernation. Ryo then tells him that he had Akira merge with Amon not to save the human race, but simply because he didn't want to see Akira disappear alongside the rest of humanity. He finishes by saying that he didn't want to fight the Devilman army and starts to walk away. Ryo says that he wants the Devilman to come with him into the new era, and with that, he turns and walks off into the sunrise. Akira now realizing who Ryo really was, calls out his true name. He turns and briefly looks over before continuing on. Soon Afterwards, he is joined byMassami Izumibetter known as the Devilman Puffurle, He asks her about Satan being as beautiful as an Angel. She tells him about how Satan was an angel who had dared to defy God and was banished from Heaven to earth. She jokes saying that maybe he has seen Satan, he flatly replies saying he had. She turns to ask what he meant but decides against it. Akira had fully realized that his longtime friend and companion was in factSatan, the fallen angel and ""God of Demon kind"". Later Akira runs into Dosu-Roku who tells him the Miki's parents had both been arrested and were now being tortured. Akira tells him to go and gather all the Devilman he knew. And with that, the entire Devilman army is gathered together as it flies over to destroy theAnti-Demon Corps HQ. The building is slowly brought down, costing the lives of several Devilman in the process. However, after the building finally collapses, Akira begins to explore the basements. He comes across the torture rooms, after looking through for a while he comes across Akiko's body scarred and bloodied hanging down from some meat hooks. He continues to look on through, and he hears someone faintly call his name he turns to see Kozo in a large torture machine. Akira goes over to him, and he has enough strength to call out Kensaku and Miki's name before coughing up his blood and passing. Akira finds the three men responsible, they beg for their lives, but he ignores the pleas and engulfs them in flames. Afterward, Akira sits and thinks about what had happened. Masami comes and finds him in the basement, she asks what he was thinking, and he replies saying that he was still thinking about Satan and humans. He says that he has realized that the humans are no longer worth fighting for as they became even worse than the Demons. But he then realizes that he still had someone to fight for, Miki. As he rushes back to the Makimura residence only see that it had been burnt to the ground and dancing around the flames were Miki's neighbors. They had the body parts of Kenskau, Masa and Miki on pikes being marched around proudly. Akira runs at them and ignites himself on fire wiping out the entire surrounding area. He picks up Miki's head and clutches it in his arms, now knowing he had nothing left to protect and starts to cry. As Akira gathers the entirety of the Devilman from across the world and prepares for battle.

What is the relationship between Miko and Kukun?,grandmother,Personality,"At the beginning of the series, Miko had a kindhearted personality and showed respect and kindness to her childhood friends, Akira and Miki. But deep down, she had a deep jealousy of Miki due to her being better than her in track and outshining her. Anyone who used her given name would confuse or mistake her for Miki Makimura, so she was given the nickname ""Miko"" to differentiate, which she quietly viewed as insulting. She also had a unquenched sexual thirst and found herself attracted to both Akira's new body and photographerKoji Nagasaki, who crudely seduced her during a photoshoot, touching herself and making noises people outside could hear. She passionately watered the flowers outside her home daily, which brought her to the attention ofKukun, who she interpreted as trying to use her to get in contact with Miki Makimura at first. She also seems to have a strained relationship with her grandmother, as soon after she is called by her real name Miki, which Kukun hears. In their second exchange, Miko once again gives him the cold shoulder, but then Kukun begins a heartfelt rap about their insecurities and she begins crying, with the two quickly becoming close friends soon after. They move to another location where Miko talks personally to Kukun about her never being better than Miki and always being ""Miko"" to everyone. Kukun comforts her, complimenting her good traits and saying she is a cute, hardworking person. The two come to the Sabbath party after Miko heard that she can become a faster runner if she attends. Kukun asks her to dance and she accepts, implying she has developed feelings for him, but this is short-lived asAledaattacks the two, killing Kukun. Miko lives through this and becomes a Devilman, similar to Akira Fudo's development. After Kukun's death, she kept his distinctive glasses to mourn him and occasionally wears them. After becoming a Devilman, Miko became arrogant, brash, and tomboyish, blinded by her desire to beat Miki no matter what. Her motivation would reawaken even more as a runner and she found herself taking joy in exerting her newfound power and showing off to other girls. She also became negligent and even stopped watering her flowers, to the point where they would dry up and wither away. The influence of her transformation as well as the subsequent mass chaos unleashed bydemonsbeing made public byRyoeventually became so extreme that she was forced to callously kill an old man who threatened and raped her at gunpoint while continuing to have sex with his corpse after crushing his head with her bare hands. The death of her grandmother during this time period also had little visible effect on her demeanor. However, after reacquainting herself with bothMoyuru KodaandAkira Fudo, she would begin to act more like her old former self, helping to treat Akira when he was injured, repairing her relationship with Miki, and helping her escape the house into the river they used to run in. She was shot multiple times by a minivan and told Miki to run away. Miko begged for Miki's life to be spared until her very last moments, questioning the humans' perspective on good, justice and humanity before shooting herself with one of their weapons to persuade them."
